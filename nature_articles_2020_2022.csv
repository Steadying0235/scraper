Prediction and risk assessment of sepsis-associated encephalopathy in ICU based on interpretable machine learning,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-27134-6,31 Dec 2022,"Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a major complication of sepsis and is associated with high mortality and poor long-term prognosis. The purpose of this study is to develop interpretable machine learning models to predict the occurrence of SAE after ICU admission and implement the individual prediction and analysis. Patients with sepsis admitted to ICU were included. SAE was diagnosed as glasgow coma score (GCS) less than 15. Statistical analysis at baseline was performed between SAE and non-SAE. Six machine learning classifiers were employed to predict the occurrence of SAE, and the adjustment of model super parameters was performed by using Bayesian optimization method. Finally, the optimal algorithm was selected according to the prediction efficiency. In addition, professional physicians were invited to evaluate our model prediction results for further quantitative assessment of the model interpretability. The preliminary analysis of variance showed significant differences in the incidence of SAE among patients with pathogen infection. There were significant differences in physical indicators like respiratory rate, temperature, SpO2 and mean arterial pressure (P < 0.001). In addition, the laboratory results were also significantly different. The optimal classification model (XGBoost) indicated that the best risk factors (cut-off points) were creatinine (1.1 mg/dl), mean respiratory rate (18), pH (7.38), age (72), chlorine (101 mmol/L), sodium (138.5 k/ul), SAPSII score (23), platelet count (160), and phosphorus (2.4 and 5.0 mg/dL). The ranked features derived from the best model (AUC is 0.8837) were mechanical ventilation, duration of mechanical ventilation, phosphorus, SOFA score, and vasopressin usage. The SAE risk prediction model based on XGBoost created here can make very accurate predictions using simple indicators and support the visual explanation. The interpretable model was effectively evaluated by professional physicians and can help them predict the occurrence of SAE more intuitively.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: membership inference; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Reverse engineering for reconstructing baseline features of dry age-related macular degeneration in optical coherence tomography,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-27140-8,31 Dec 2022,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most widespread cause of blindness and the identification of baseline AMD features or biomarkers is critical for early intervention. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging produces a 3D volume consisting of cross sections of retinal tissue while fundus fluorescence (FAF) imaging produces a 2D mapping of retina. FAF has been a good standard for assessing dry AMD late-stage geographic atrophy (GA) while OCT has been used for assessing early AMD biomarkers beyond as well. However, previous approaches in large extent defined AMD features subjectively based on clinicians’ observation. Deep learning—an objective artificial intelligence approach, may enable to discover ’true’ salient AMD features. We develop a novel reverse engineering approach which bases on the backbone of a fully convolutional neural network to objectively identify and visualize AMD early biomarkers in OCT from baseline exams before significant atrophy occurs. Utilizing manually annotated GA regions on FAF from a follow-up visit as ground truth, we segment GA regions and reconstruct early AMD features in baseline OCT volumes. In this preliminary exploration, compared with ground truth, we achieve baseline GA segmentation accuracy of 0.95 and overlapping ratio of 0.65. The reconstructions consistently highlight that large druse and druse clusters with or without mixed hyper-reflective focus lesion on baseline OCT cause the conversion of GA after 12 months. However, hyper-reflective focus lesions and subretinal drusenoid deposit lesions alone are not seen such conversion after 12 months. Further research with larger dataset would be needed to verify these findings.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Revelation of microcracks as tooth structural element by X-ray tomography and machine learning,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-27062-5,28 Dec 2022,"Although teeth microcracks (MCs) have long been considered more of an aesthetic problem, their exact role in the structure of a tooth and impact on its functionality is still unknown. The aim of this study was to reveal the possibilities of an X-ray micro-computed tomography (\(\mu\)CT) in combination with convolutional neural network (CNN) assisted voxel classification and volume segmentation for three-dimensional (3D) qualitative analysis of tooth microstructure and verify this approach with four extracted human premolars. Samples were scanned using a \(\mu\)CT instrument (Xradia 520 Versa; ZEISS) and segmented with CNN to identify enamel, dentin, and cracks. A new CNN image segmentation model was trained based on “Multiclass semantic segmentation using DeepLabV3+” example and was implemented with “TensorFlow”. The technique which was used allowed 3D characterization of all MCs of a tooth, regardless of the volume of the tooth in which they begin and extend, and the evaluation of the arrangement of cracks and their structural features. The proposed method revealed an intricate star-shaped network of MCs covering most of the inner tooth, and the main crack planes in all samples were arranged radially in two almost perpendicular directions, suggesting that the cracks could be considered as a planar structure.","The presented novel technique—using X-ray \(\mu\)CT in combination with CNN assisted segmentation - reveals the possibilities for a non-destructive and comprehensive 3D qualitative analysis of tooth microstructure. This method allows 3D characterization of all MCs of a tooth, regardless of the volume of the tooth in which they begin and extend, as well as the evaluation of the arrangement of cracks and their structural features. Anatomical characteristics of the tooth, such as enamel thickness, surface convexity or roughness, should no longer be a barrier to analyzing MCs with the described technique.Using the proposed approach, a network of MCs inside all four healthy teeth (with or without visible MCs on the buccal surface) has been revealed, suggesting that the cracks could be considered as one of the structural and possibly functional (i.e. serving the function of redistribution of forces) elements of the tooth, with a protective, rather than a damaging function.Detailed volumetric imaging of the MCs of a tooth expands our understanding of the cracking pattern in natural hard materials and allows us to gain more insight into how biologically inspired structures could be designed to predict the propagation of cracks in solid materials. From a clinical point of view, there is a need to revise the definition of MC that has been used so far, to re-evaluate the role and impact of these cracks on the integrity and longevity of the tooth, and to develop new algorithms for the monitoring and treatment of teeth with MCs in daily clinical practice.","DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Diagnostic potential of the amniotic fluid cells transcriptome in deciphering mendelian disease: a proof-of-concept,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41525-022-00347-4,28 Dec 2022,"RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is emerging in genetic diagnoses as it provides functional support for the interpretation of variants of uncertain significance. However, the use of amniotic fluid (AF) cells for RNA-seq has not yet been explored. Here, we examined the expression of clinically relevant genes in AF cells (n = 48) compared with whole blood and fibroblasts. The number of well-expressed genes in AF cells was comparable to that in fibroblasts and much higher than that in blood across different disease categories. We found AF cells RNA-seq feasible and beneficial in prenatal diagnosis (n = 4) as transcriptomic data elucidated the molecular consequence leading to the pathogenicity upgrade of variants in CHD7 and COL1A2 and revising the in silico prediction of a variant in MYRF. AF cells RNA-seq could become a reasonable choice for postnatal patients with advantages over fibroblasts and blood as it prevents invasive procedures.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Predicting graft failure in pediatric liver transplantation based on early biomarkers using machine learning models,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-25900-0,27 Dec 2022,"The early detection of graft failure in pediatric liver transplantation is crucial for appropriate intervention. Graft failure is associated with numerous perioperative risk factors. This study aimed to develop an individualized predictive model for 90-days graft failure in pediatric liver transplantation using machine learning methods. We conducted a single-center retrospective cohort study. A total of 87 liver transplantation cases performed in patients aged < 12 years at the Severance Hospital between January 2010 and September 2020 were included as data samples. Preoperative conditions of recipients and donors, intraoperative care, postoperative serial laboratory parameters, and events observed within seven days of surgery were collected as features. A least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) -based method was used for feature selection to overcome the high dimensionality and collinearity of variables. Among 146 features, four variables were selected as the resultant features, namely, preoperative hepatic encephalopathy, sodium level at the end of surgery, hepatic artery thrombosis, and total bilirubin level on postoperative day 7. These features were selected from different times and represent distinct clinical aspects. The model with logistic regression demonstrated the best prediction performance among various machine learning methods tested (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) = 0.898 and area under the precision–recall curve (AUPR) = 0.882). The risk scoring system developed based on the logistic regression model showed an AUROC of 0.910 and an AUPR of 0.830. Together, the prediction of graft failure in pediatric liver transplantation using the proposed machine learning model exhibited superior discrimination power and, therefore, can provide valuable information to clinicians for their decision making during the postoperative management of the patients.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
A standalone incompatible insect technique enables mosquito suppression in the urban subtropics,https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-022-04332-6,27 Dec 2022,"The strong suppression of Aedes albopictus on two Guangzhou islands in China has been successfully achieved by releasing males with an artificial triple-Wolbachia infection. However, it requires the use of radiation to sterilize residual females to prevent population replacement. To develop a highly effective tool for dengue control, we tested a standalone incompatible insect technique (IIT) to control A. albopictus in the urban area of Changsha, an inland city where dengue recently emerged. Male mosquitoes were produced in a mass rearing facility in Guangzhou and transported over 670 km under low temperature to the release site. After a once-per-week release with high numbers of males (phase I) and a subsequent twice-per-week release with low numbers of males (phase II), the average numbers of hatched eggs and female adults collected weekly per trap were reduced by 97% and 85%, respectively. The population suppression caused a 94% decrease in mosquito biting at the release site compared to the control site. Remarkably, this strong suppression was achieved using only 28% of the number of males released in a previous trial. Despite the lack of irradiation to sterilize residual females, no triple-infected mosquitoes were detected in the field post release based on the monitoring of adult and larval A. albopictus populations for two years, indicating that population replacement was prevented. Our results support the feasibility of implementing a standalone IIT for dengue control in urban areas.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: ; Attacker Capability: 
A new strategy for the early detection of alzheimer disease stages using multifractal geometry analysis based on K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-26958-6,26 Dec 2022,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is considered one of the most diseases that much prevalent among elderly people all over the world. AD is an incurable neurodegenerative disease affecting cognitive functions and were characterized by progressive and collective functions deteriorating. Remarkably, early detection of AD is essential for the development of new and invented treatment strategies. As Dementia causes irreversible damage to the brain neurons and leads to changes in its structure that can be described adequately within the framework of multifractals. Hence, the present work focus on developing a promising and efficient computing technique to pre-process and classify the AD disease especially in the early stages using multifractal geometry to extract the most changeable features due to AD. Then, A machine learning classification algorithm (K-Nearest Neighbor) has been implemented in order to classify and detect the main four early stages of AD. Two datasets have been used to ensure the validation of the proposed methodology. The proposed technique has achieved 99.4% accuracy and 100% sensitivity. The comparative results show that the proposed classification technique outperforms is recent techniques in terms of performance measures.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
A large language model for electronic health records,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-022-00742-2,26 Dec 2022,"There is an increasing interest in developing artificial intelligence (AI) systems to process and interpret electronic health records (EHRs). Natural language processing (NLP) powered by pretrained language models is the key technology for medical AI systems utilizing clinical narratives. However, there are few clinical language models, the largest of which trained in the clinical domain is comparatively small at 110 million parameters (compared with billions of parameters in the general domain). It is not clear how large clinical language models with billions of parameters can help medical AI systems utilize unstructured EHRs. In this study, we develop from scratch a large clinical language model—GatorTron—using >90 billion words of text (including >82 billion words of de-identified clinical text) and systematically evaluate it on five clinical NLP tasks including clinical concept extraction, medical relation extraction, semantic textual similarity, natural language inference (NLI), and medical question answering (MQA). We examine how (1) scaling up the number of parameters and (2) scaling up the size of the training data could benefit these NLP tasks. GatorTron models scale up the clinical language model from 110 million to 8.9 billion parameters and improve five clinical NLP tasks (e.g., 9.6% and 9.5% improvement in accuracy for NLI and MQA), which can be applied to medical AI systems to improve healthcare delivery.

Development and validation of a predictive scoring system for in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 Egyptian patients: a retrospective study,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-26471-w,26 Dec 2022,"SARS-CoV-2 virus has rapidly spread worldwide since December 2019, causing COVID-19 disease. In-hospital mortality is a common indicator for evaluating treatment outcomes. Therefore, the developing and validating a simple score system from observational data could assist in modulating the management procedures. A retrospective cohort study included all data records of patients with positive PCR for SARS-CoV-2. The factors that associated with mortality were analyzed, then allocation of potential predictors of mortality was executed using different logistic regression modeling, subsequently scoring system was developed from the most weighted predictors. The mortality rate of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia was 28.5% and 28.74%, respectively. The most significant factors that affected in-hospital mortality were old age (> 60 years), delay in hospital admission (> 4 days), high neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio “NLR” (> 3); higher computed tomography severity score; and CT-SS (> 20), in addition to using remdesivir and tocilizumab in the treatment protocol (P < 0.001 for all). The validity of the newly performed score was significant; the AUC was 85%, P < 0.001, and its prognostic utility was good; the AUC was 75%, P < 0.001. The prognostic utility of newly developed score system (EGY.Score) was excellent and could be used to adjust the treatment strategy of highly at-risk patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Transition in vaginal Lactobacillus species during pregnancy and prediction of preterm birth in Korean women,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-26058-5,24 Dec 2022,"The predominance of vaginal Lactobacillus species, specifically L. crispatus, is important for pregnancy maintenance, but varies by race. The composition of the vaginal microbiome can affect susceptibility to adverse pregnancy outcomes. We performed 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing on vaginal swabs taken from Korean pregnant women. Here, we report the transition of Lactobacillus spp. in samples of full-term birth (FTB) collected longitudinally in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy in a cohort study (n = 23) and their association with Lactobacillus abundance and preterm birth (PTB) in a case–control study (n = 200). Lactobacillus species, which was dominant in FTB samples including those that received interventions in the second trimester, did not change until 37 weeks of gestation. However, L. crispatus was replaced by other Lactobacillus species after 37 weeks. The PTB risk showed a closer association with the Lactobacillus abundance than with community state type determined by Lactobacillus species. PTB was associated with less than 90% of Lactobacillus abundance and an increase in Ureplasma parvum in the second trimester. Thus, the vaginal microbiome may change in preparation for childbirth in response to multiple intrinsic factors after 37 weeks of gestation. Monitoring the Lactobacillus abundance may help improve the reliability of microbial PTB biomarkers.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
A molecular barcode and web-based data analysis tool to identify imported Plasmodium vivax malaria,https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-022-04352-2,23 Dec 2022,"Traditionally, patient travel history has been used to distinguish imported from autochthonous malaria cases, but the dormant liver stages of Plasmodium vivax confound this approach. Molecular tools offer an alternative method to identify, and map imported cases. Using machine learning approaches incorporating hierarchical fixation index and decision tree analyses applied to 799 P. vivax genomes from 21 countries, we identified 33-SNP, 50-SNP and 55-SNP barcodes (GEO33, GEO50 and GEO55), with high capacity to predict the infection’s country of origin. The Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) for an existing, commonly applied 38-SNP barcode (BR38) exceeded 0.80 in 62% countries. The GEO panels outperformed BR38, with median MCCs > 0.80 in 90% countries at GEO33, and 95% at GEO50 and GEO55. An online, open-access, likelihood-based classifier framework was established to support data analysis (vivaxGEN-geo). The SNP selection and classifier methods can be readily amended for other use cases to support malaria control programs.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Surgical gestures as a method to quantify surgical performance and predict patient outcomes,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-022-00738-y,22 Dec 2022,"How well a surgery is performed impacts a patient’s outcomes; however, objective quantification of performance remains an unsolved challenge. Deconstructing a procedure into discrete instrument-tissue “gestures” is a emerging way to understand surgery. To establish this paradigm in a procedure where performance is the most important factor for patient outcomes, we identify 34,323 individual gestures performed in 80 nerve-sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomies from two international medical centers. Gestures are classified into nine distinct dissection gestures (e.g., hot cut) and four supporting gestures (e.g., retraction). Our primary outcome is to identify factors impacting a patient’s 1-year erectile function (EF) recovery after radical prostatectomy. We find that less use of hot cut and more use of peel/push are statistically associated with better chance of 1-year EF recovery. Our results also show interactions between surgeon experience and gesture types—similar gesture selection resulted in different EF recovery rates dependent on surgeon experience. To further validate this framework, two teams independently constructe distinct machine learning models using gesture sequences vs. traditional clinical features to predict 1-year EF. In both models, gesture sequences are able to better predict 1-year EF (Team 1: AUC 0.77, 95% CI 0.73–0.81; Team 2: AUC 0.68, 95% CI 0.66–0.70) than traditional clinical features (Team 1: AUC 0.69, 95% CI 0.65–0.73; Team 2: AUC 0.65, 95% CI 0.62–0.68). Our results suggest that gestures provide a granular method to objectively indicate surgical performance and outcomes. Application of this methodology to other surgeries may lead to discoveries on methods to improve surgery.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Machine learning-assisted system using digital facial images to predict the clinical activity score in thyroid-associated orbitopathy,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-25887-8,21 Dec 2022,"Although the clinical activity score (CAS) is a validated scoring system for identifying disease activity of thyroid-associated orbitopathy (TAO), it may produce differing results depending on the evaluator, and an experienced ophthalmologist is required for accurate evaluation. In this study, we developed a machine learning (ML)-assisted system to mimic an expert’s CAS assessment using digital facial images and evaluated its accuracy for predicting the CAS and diagnosing active TAO (CAS ≥ 3). An ML-assisted system was designed to assess five CAS components related to inflammatory signs (redness of the eyelids, redness of the conjunctiva, swelling of the eyelids, inflammation of the caruncle and/or plica, and conjunctival edema) in patients’ facial images and to predict the CAS by considering two components of subjective symptoms (spontaneous retrobulbar pain and pain on gaze). To train and test the system, 3,060 cropped images from 1020 digital facial images of TAO patients were used. The reference CAS for each image was scored by three ophthalmologists, each with > 15 years of clinical experience. We repeated the experiments for 30 randomly split training and test sets at a ratio of 8:2. The sensitivity and specificity of the ML-assisted system for diagnosing active TAO were 72.7% and 83.2% in the test set constructed from the entire dataset. For the test set constructed from the dataset with consistent results for the three ophthalmologists, the sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing active TAO were 88.1% and 86.9%. In the test sets from the entire dataset and from the dataset with consistent results, 40.0% and 49.9% of the predicted CAS values were the same as the reference CAS, respectively. The system predicted the CAS within 1 point of the reference CAS in 84.6% and 89.0% of cases when tested using the entire dataset and in the dataset with consistent results, respectively. An ML-assisted system estimated the clinical activity of TAO and detect inflammatory active TAO with reasonable accuracy. The accuracy could be improved further by obtaining more data. This ML-assisted system can help evaluate the disease activity consistently as well as accurately and enable the early diagnosis and timely treatment of active TAO.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Early prediction of upper limb functioning after stroke using clinical bedside assessments: a prospective longitudinal study,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-26585-1,21 Dec 2022,"Early and accurate prediction of recovery is needed to assist treatment planning and inform patient selection in clinical trials. This study aimed to develop a prediction algorithm using a set of simple early clinical bedside measures to predict upper limb capacity at 3-months post-stroke. A secondary analysis of Stroke Arm Longitudinal Study at Gothenburg University (SALGOT) included 94 adults (mean age 68 years) with upper limb impairment admitted to stroke unit). Cluster analysis was used to define the endpoint outcome strata according to the 3-months Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) scores. Modelling was carried out in a training (70%) and testing set (30%) using traditional logistic regression, random forest models. The final algorithm included 3 simple bedside tests performed 3-days post stroke: ability to grasp, to produce any measurable grip strength and abduct/elevate shoulder. An 86–94% model sensitivity, specificity and accuracy was reached for differentiation between poor, limited and good outcome. Additional measurement of grip strength at 4 weeks post-stroke and haemorrhagic stroke explained the underestimated classifications. External validation of the model is recommended. Simple bedside assessments have advantages over more lengthy and complex assessments and could thereby be integrated into routine clinical practice to aid therapy decisions, guide patient selection in clinical trials and used in data registries.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Machine learning-derived gut microbiome signature predicts fatty liver disease in the presence of insulin resistance,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-26102-4,17 Dec 2022,"A simple predictive biomarker for fatty liver disease is required for individuals with insulin resistance. Here, we developed a supervised machine learning-based classifier for fatty liver disease using fecal 16S rDNA sequencing data. Based on the Kangbuk Samsung Hospital cohort (n = 777), we generated a random forest classifier to predict fatty liver diseases in individuals with or without insulin resistance (n = 166 and n = 611, respectively). The model performance was evaluated based on metrics, including accuracy, area under receiver operating curve (AUROC), kappa, and F1-score. The developed classifier for fatty liver diseases performed better in individuals with insulin resistance (AUROC = 0.77). We further optimized the classifiers using genetic algorithm. The improved classifier for insulin resistance, consisting of ten microbial genera, presented an advanced classification (AUROC = 0.93), whereas the improved classifier for insulin-sensitive individuals failed to distinguish participants with fatty liver diseases from the healthy. The classifier for individuals with insulin resistance was comparable or superior to previous methods predicting fatty liver diseases (accuracy = 0.83, kappa = 0.50, F1-score = 0.89), such as the fatty liver index. We identified the ten genera as a core set from the human gut microbiome, which could be a diagnostic biomarker of fatty liver diseases for insulin resistant individuals. Collectively, these findings indicate that the machine learning classifier for fatty liver diseases in the presence of insulin resistance is comparable or superior to commonly used methods.",Conclusions not available,,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Label-free testing strategy to evaluate packed red blood cell quality before transfusion to leukemia patients,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-26309-5,17 Dec 2022,"Patients worldwide require therapeutic transfusions of packed red blood cells (pRBCs), which is applied to the high-risk patients who need periodic transfusions due to leukemia,  lymphoma, myeloma and other blood diseases or disorders. Contrary to the general hospital population where the transfusions are carried out mainly for healthy trauma patients, in case of high-risk patients the proper quality of pRBCs is crucial. This leads to an increased demand for efficient technology providing information on the pRBCs alterations deteriorating their quality. Here we present the design of an innovative, label-free, noninvasive, rapid Raman spectroscopy-based method for pRBCs quality evaluation, starting with the description of sample measurement and data analysis, through correlation of spectroscopic results with reference techniques' outcomes, and finishing with methodology verification and its application in clinical conditions. We have shown that Raman spectra collected from the pRBCs supernatant mixture with a proper chemometric analysis conducted for a minimum one ratio of integral intensities of the chosen Raman marker bands within the spectrum allow evaluation of the pRBC quality in a rapid, noninvasive, and free-label manner, without unsealing the pRBCs bag. Subsequently, spectroscopic data were compared with predefined reference values, either from pRBCs expiration or those defining the pRBCs quality, allowing to assess their utility for transfusion to patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Periportal steatosis in mice affects distinct parameters of pericentral drug metabolism,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-26483-6,17 Dec 2022,"Little is known about the impact of morphological disorders in distinct zones on metabolic zonation. It was described recently that periportal fibrosis did affect the expression of CYP proteins, a set of pericentrally located drug-metabolizing enzymes. Here, we investigated whether periportal steatosis might have a similar effect. Periportal steatosis was induced in C57BL6/J mice by feeding a high-fat diet with low methionine/choline content for either two or four weeks. Steatosis severity was quantified using image analysis. Triglycerides and CYP activity were quantified in photometric or fluorometric assay. The distribution of CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP2E1 was visualized by immunohistochemistry. Pharmacokinetic parameters of test drugs were determined after injecting a drug cocktail (caffeine, codeine, and midazolam). The dietary model resulted in moderate to severe mixed steatosis confined to periportal and midzonal areas. Periportal steatosis did not affect the zonal distribution of CYP expression but the activity of selected CYPs was associated with steatosis severity. Caffeine elimination was accelerated by microvesicular steatosis, whereas midazolam elimination was delayed in macrovesicular steatosis. In summary, periportal steatosis affected parameters of pericentrally located drug metabolism. This observation calls for further investigations of the highly complex interrelationship between steatosis and drug metabolism and underlying signaling mechanisms.",Conclusions not available,Gen AI,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
The influence of patient characteristics on the alarm rate in intensive care units: a retrospective cohort study,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-26261-4,16 Dec 2022,"Intensive care units (ICU) are often overflooded with alarms from monitoring devices which constitutes a hazard to both staff and patients. To date, the suggested solutions to excessive monitoring alarms have remained on a research level. We aimed to identify patient characteristics that affect the ICU alarm rate with the goal of proposing a straightforward solution that can easily be implemented in ICUs. Alarm logs from eight adult ICUs of a tertiary care university-hospital in Berlin, Germany were retrospectively collected between September 2019 and March 2021. Adult patients admitted to the ICU with at least 24 h of continuous alarm logs were included in the study. The sum of alarms per patient per day was calculated. The median was 119. A total of 26,890 observations from 3205 patients were included. 23 variables were extracted from patients' electronic health records (EHR) and a multivariable logistic regression was performed to evaluate the association of patient characteristics and alarm rates.

Our study suggests that patient-specific alarm management should be integrated in the clinical routine of ICUs. To reduce the overall alarm load, particular attention regarding alarm management should be paid to patients with invasive blood pressure monitoring, invasive mechanical ventilation, heart failure, chronic renal failure, hypertension, high RASS or scheduled surgical admission since they are more likely to have a high contribution to noise pollution, alarm fatigue and hence compromised patient safety in ICUs.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
The PAD-US-AR dataset: Measuring accessible and recreational parks in the contiguous United States,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01857-7,16 Dec 2022,"Most spatial epidemiological studies of nature-health relationships use generalized greenspace measures. For instance, coarse-resolution spatial data containing normalized difference vegetative index (NDVI) values are prominent despite criticisms, such as the inability to restrain exposure estimates to public and private land. Non-threatening natural landscapes can improve health by building capacities for health-promoting behaviors. Recreational and accessible parks may best activate such behaviors. We curated the Parks and Protected Areas Database of the U.S. (PAD-US) to identify parks that are accessible for outdoor recreation. Our title adds “AR” to “PAD-US” where A = Accessible and R = Recreational. We validated the PAD-US-AR by comparisons with greenspace datasets and sociodemographics, which demonstrated its uniqueness from other commonly employed metrics of nature exposure. The PAD-US-AR presents reliable estimates of parks in the contiguous U.S. that are accessible for outdoor recreation. It has strong associations with home prices, shares of female residents, and shares of older residents. This dataset can accompany other nature exposure metrics in environmental epidemiology and allied research fields.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: ; Attacker Capability:

Expert-level aspiration and penetration detection during flexible endoscopic evaluation of swallowing with artificial intelligence-assisted diagnosis,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-25618-z,15 Dec 2022,"Flexible endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) is considered the gold standard in diagnosing oropharyngeal dysphagia. Recent advances in deep learning have led to a resurgence of artificial intelligence-assisted computer-aided diagnosis (AI-assisted CAD) for a variety of applications. AI-assisted CAD would be a remarkable benefit in providing medical services to populations with inadequate access to dysphagia experts, especially in aging societies. This paper presents an AI-assisted CAD named FEES-CAD for aspiration and penetration detection on video recording during FEES. FEES-CAD segments the input FEES video and classifies penetration, aspiration, residue in the vallecula, and residue in the hypopharynx based on the segmented FEES video. We collected and annotated FEES videos from 199 patients to train the network and tested the performance of FEES-CAD using FEES videos from other 40 patients. These patients consecutively underwent FEES between December 2016 and August 2019 at Fukushima Medical University Hospital. FEES videos were deidentified, randomized, and rated by FEES-CAD and laryngologists with over 15 years of experience in performing FEES. FEES-CAD achieved an average Dice similarity coefficient of 98.6\(\%\). FEES-CAD achieved expert-level accuracy performance on penetration (92.5\(\%\)), aspiration (92.5\(\%\)), residue in the vallecula (100\(\%\)), and residue in the hypopharynx (87.5\(\%\)) classification tasks. To the best of our knowledge, FEES-CAD is the first CNN-based system that achieves expert-level performance in detecting aspiration and penetration.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Predicting multipotency of human adult stem cells derived from various donors through deep learning,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-25423-8,14 Dec 2022,"Adult stem cell-based therapeutic approaches have great potential in regenerative medicine because of their immunoregulatory properties and multidifferentiation capacity. Nevertheless, the outcomes of stem cell‑based therapies to date have shown inconsistent efficacy owing to donor variation, thwarting the expectation of clinical effects. However, such donor dependency has been elucidated by biological consequences that current research could not predict. Here, we introduce cellular morphology-based prediction to determine the multipotency rate of human nasal turbinate stem cells (hNTSCs), aiming to predict the differentiation rate of keratocyte progenitors. We characterized the overall genes and morphologies of hNTSCs from five donors and compared stemness-related properties, including multipotency and specific lineages, using mRNA sequencing. It was demonstrated that transformation factors affecting the principal components were highly related to cell morphology. We then performed a convolutional neural network-based analysis, which enabled us to assess the multipotency level of each cell group based on their morphologies with 85.98% accuracy. Surprisingly, the trend in expression levels after ex vivo differentiation matched well with the deep learning prediction. These results suggest that AI‑assisted cellular behavioral prediction can be utilized to perform quantitative, non-invasive, single-cell, and multimarker characterizations of live stem cells for improved quality control in clinical cell therapies.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
The WHO estimates of excess mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05522-2,14 Dec 2022,"The World Health Organization has a mandate to compile and disseminate statistics on mortality, and we have been tracking the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic since the beginning of 20201. Reported statistics on COVID-19 mortality are problematic for many countries owing to variations in testing access, differential diagnostic capacity and inconsistent certification of COVID-19 as cause of death. Beyond what is directly attributable to it, the pandemic has caused extensive collateral damage that has led to losses of lives and livelihoods. Here we report a comprehensive and consistent measurement of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic by estimating excess deaths, by month, for 2020 and 2021. We predict the pandemic period all-cause deaths in locations lacking complete reported data using an overdispersed Poisson count framework that applies Bayesian inference techniques to quantify uncertainty. We estimate 14.83 million excess deaths globally, 2.74 times more deaths than the 5.42 million reported as due to COVID-19 for the period. There are wide variations in the excess death estimates across the six World Health Organization regions. We describe the data and methods used to generate these estimates and highlight the need for better reporting where gaps persist. We discuss various summary measures, and the hazards of ranking countries’ epidemic responses.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: ; Attacker Capability: 
Optimal deep brain stimulation sites and networks for stimulation of the fornix in Alzheimer’s disease,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-34510-3,14 Dec 2022,"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) to the fornix is an investigational treatment for patients with mild Alzheimer’s Disease. Outcomes from randomized clinical trials have shown that cognitive function improved in some patients but deteriorated in others. This could be explained by variance in electrode placement leading to differential engagement of neural circuits. To investigate this, we performed a post-hoc analysis on a multi-center cohort of 46 patients with DBS to the fornix (NCT00658125, NCT01608061). Using normative structural and functional connectivity data, we found that stimulation of the circuit of Papez and stria terminalis robustly associated with cognitive improvement (R = 0.53, p < 0.001). On a local level, the optimal stimulation site resided at the direct interface between these structures (R = 0.48, p < 0.001). Finally, modulating specific distributed brain networks related to memory accounted for optimal outcomes (R = 0.48, p < 0.001). Findings were robust to multiple cross-validation designs and may define an optimal network target that could refine DBS surgery and programming.",Conclusions not available,Gen AI,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Digitalization impacts the COVID-19 pandemic and the stringency of government measures,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-24726-0,14 Dec 2022,"COVID-19 poses a significant burden to populations worldwide. Although the pandemic has accelerated digital transformation, little is known about the influence of digitalization on pandemic developments. Therefore, this country-level study aims to explore the impact of pre-pandemic digital adoption on COVID-19 outcomes and government measures. Using the Digital Adoption Index (DAI), we examined the association between countries' digital preparedness levels and COVID-19 cases, deaths, and stringency indices (SI) of government measures until March 2021. Gradient Tree Boosting based algorithm pinpointed essential features related to COVID-19 trends, such as digital adoption, populations' smoker fraction, age, and poverty. Subsequently, regression analyses indicated that higher DAI was associated with significant declines in new cases (β = − 362.25/pm; p < 0.001) and attributed deaths (β = − 5.53/pm; p < 0.001) months after the peak. When plotting DAI against the SI normalized for the starting day, countries with higher DAI adopted slightly more stringent government measures (β = 4.86; p < 0.01). Finally, a scoping review identified 70 publications providing valuable arguments for our findings. Countries with higher DAI before the pandemic show a positive trend in handling the pandemic and facilitate the implementation of more decisive governmental measures. Further distribution of digital adoption may have the potential to attenuate the impact of COVID-19 cases and deaths.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Autoencoders for sample size estimation for fully connected neural network classifiers,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-022-00728-0,13 Dec 2022,"Sample size estimation is a crucial step in experimental design but is understudied in the context of deep learning. Currently, estimating the quantity of labeled data needed to train a classifier to a desired performance, is largely based on prior experience with similar models and problems or on untested heuristics. In many supervised machine learning applications, data labeling can be expensive and time-consuming and would benefit from a more rigorous means of estimating labeling requirements. Here, we study the problem of estimating the minimum sample size of labeled training data necessary for training computer vision models as an exemplar for other deep learning problems. We consider the problem of identifying the minimal number of labeled data points to achieve a generalizable representation of the data, a minimum converging sample (MCS). We use autoencoder loss to estimate the MCS for fully connected neural network classifiers. At sample sizes smaller than the MCS estimate, fully connected networks fail to distinguish classes, and at sample sizes above the MCS estimate, generalizability strongly correlates with the loss function of the autoencoder. We provide an easily accessible, code-free, and dataset-agnostic tool to estimate sample sizes for fully connected networks. Taken together, our findings suggest that MCS and convergence estimation are promising methods to guide sample size estimates for data collection and labeling prior to training deep learning models in computer vision.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: ; Attacker Capability: 
Diagnosis of nasal bone fractures on plain radiographs via convolutional neural networks,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-26161-7,13 Dec 2022,"This study aimed to assess the performance of deep learning (DL) algorithms in the diagnosis of nasal bone fractures on radiographs and compare it with that of experienced radiologists. In this retrospective study, 6713 patients whose nasal radiographs were examined for suspected nasal bone fractures between January 2009 and October 2020 were assessed. Our dataset was randomly split into training (n = 4325), validation (n = 481), and internal test (n = 1250) sets; a separate external dataset (n = 102) was used. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity of the DL algorithm and the two radiologists were compared. The AUCs of the DL algorithm for the internal and external test sets were 0.85 (95% CI, 0.83–0.86) and 0.86 (95% CI, 0.78–0.93), respectively, and those of the two radiologists for the external test set were 0.80 (95% CI, 0.73–0.87) and 0.75 (95% CI, 0.68–0.82). The DL algorithm therefore significantly exceeded radiologist 2 (P = 0.021) but did not significantly differ from radiologist 1 (P = 0.142). The sensitivity and specificity of the DL algorithm were 83.1% (95% CI, 71.2–93.2%) and 83.7% (95% CI, 69.8–93.0%), respectively. Our DL algorithm performs comparably to experienced radiologists in diagnosing nasal bone fractures on radiographs.",Conclusions not available,DNN,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Interpretable prognostic modeling of endometrial cancer,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-26134-w,13 Dec 2022,"Endometrial carcinoma (EC) is one of the most common gynecological cancers in the world. In this work we apply Cox proportional hazards (CPH) and optimal survival tree (OST) algorithms to the retrospective prognostic modeling of disease-specific survival in 842 EC patients. We demonstrate that linear CPH models are preferred for the EC risk assessment based on clinical features alone, while interpretable, non-linear OST models are favored when patient profiles can be supplemented with additional biomarker data. We show how visually interpretable tree models can help generate and explore novel research hypotheses by studying the OST decision path structure, in which L1 cell adhesion molecule expression and estrogen receptor status are correctly indicated as important risk factors in the p53 abnormal EC subgroup. To aid further clinical adoption of advanced machine learning techniques, we stress the importance of quantifying model discrimination and calibration performance in the development of explainable clinical prediction models.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Features derived from blood pressure and intracranial pressure predict elevated intracranial pressure events in critically ill children,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-25169-3,12 Dec 2022,"Clinicians frequently observe hemodynamic changes preceding elevated intracranial pressure events. We employed a machine learning approach to identify novel and differentially expressed features associated with elevated intracranial pressure events in children with severe brain injuries. Statistical features from physiologic data streams were derived from non-overlapping 30-min analysis windows prior to 21 elevated intracranial pressure events; 200 records without elevated intracranial pressure events were used as controls. Ten Monte Carlo simulations with training/testing splits provided performance benchmarks for 4 machine learning approaches. XGBoost yielded the best performing predictive models. Shapley Additive Explanations analyses demonstrated that a majority of the top 20 contributing features consistently derived from blood pressure data streams up to 240 min prior to elevated intracranial events. The best performing prediction model was using the 30–60 min analysis window; for this model, the area under the receiver operating characteristic window using XGBoost was 0.82 (95% CI 0.81–0.83); the area under the precision-recall curve was 0.24 (95% CI 0.23–0.25), above the expected baseline of 0.1. We conclude that physiomarkers discernable by machine learning are concentrated within blood pressure and intracranial pressure data up to 4 h prior to elevated intracranial pressure events.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Identifying myoglobin as a mediator of diabetic kidney disease: a machine learning-based cross-sectional study,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-25299-8,10 Dec 2022,"In view of the alarming increase in the burden of diabetes mellitus (DM) today, a rising number of patients with diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is forecasted. Current DKD predictive models often lack reliable biomarkers and perform poorly. In this regard, serum myoglobin (Mb) identified by machine learning (ML) may become a potential DKD indicator. We aimed to elucidate the significance of serum Mb in the pathogenesis of DKD. Electronic health record data from a total of 728 hospitalized patients with DM (286 DKD vs. 442 non-DKD) were used. We developed DKD ML models incorporating serum Mb and metabolic syndrome (MetS) components (insulin resistance and β-cell function, glucose, lipid) while using SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) to interpret features. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) models were applied to evaluate the relationship between serum Mb and DKD. Serum Mb-mediated renal function impairment induced by MetS components was verified by causal mediation effect analysis. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the DKD machine learning models incorporating serum Mb and MetS components reached 0.85. Feature importance analysis and SHAP showed that serum Mb and MetS components were important features. Further RCS models of DKD showed that the odds ratio was greater than 1 when serum Mb was > 80. Serum Mb showed a significant indirect effect in renal function impairment when using MetS components such as HOMA-IR, HGI and HDL-C/TC as a reason. Moderately elevated serum Mb is associated with the risk of DKD. Serum Mb may mediate MetS component-caused renal function impairment.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Predicting an unstable tear film through artificial intelligence,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-25821-y,10 Dec 2022,"Dry eye disease is one of the most common ophthalmological complaints and is defined by a loss of tear film homeostasis.

In this pilot study, we retrospectively included clinical data from 431 patients with dry eye disease examined in the Norwegian Dry Eye Clinic to evaluate how artificial intelligence algorithms perform on clinical data related to dry eye disease. The data was processed and subjected to numerous machine learning classification algorithms with the aim to predict decreased tear film break-up time. Moreover, feature selection techniques (information gain and information gain ratio) were applied to determine which clinical factors contribute most to an unstable tear film. The applied machine learning algorithms outperformed baseline classifications performed with ZeroR according to included evaluation metrics. Clinical features such as ocular surface staining, meibomian gland expressibility and dropout, blink frequency, osmolarity, meibum quality and symptom score were recognized as important predictors for tear film instability.

A Multifaceted benchmarking of synthetic electronic health record generation models,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-35295-1,09 Dec 2022,"Synthetic health data have the potential to mitigate privacy concerns in supporting biomedical research and healthcare applications. Modern approaches for data generation continue to evolve and demonstrate remarkable potential. Yet there is a lack of a systematic assessment framework to benchmark methods as they emerge and determine which methods are most appropriate for which use cases. In this work, we introduce a systematic benchmarking framework to appraise key characteristics with respect to utility and privacy metrics. We apply the framework to evaluate synthetic data generation methods for electronic health records data from two large academic medical centers with respect to several use cases. The results illustrate that there is a utility-privacy tradeoff for sharing synthetic health data and further indicate that no method is unequivocally the best on all criteria in each use case, which makes it evident why synthetic data generation methods need to be assessed in context.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: membership inference; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Predicting 180-day mortality for women with ovarian cancer using machine learning and patient-reported outcome data,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-22614-1,08 Dec 2022,"Contrary to national guidelines, women with ovarian cancer often receive treatment at the end of life, potentially due to the difficulty in accurately estimating prognosis. We trained machine learning algorithms to guide prognosis by predicting 180-day mortality for women with ovarian cancer using patient-reported outcomes (PRO) data. We collected data from a single academic cancer institution in the United States. Women completed biopsychosocial PRO measures every 90 days. We randomly partitioned our dataset into training and testing samples. We used synthetic minority oversampling to reduce class imbalance in the training dataset. We fitted training data to six machine learning algorithms and combined their classifications on the testing dataset into an unweighted voting ensemble. We assessed each algorithm's accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) using testing data. We recruited 245 patients who completed 1319 PRO assessments. The final voting ensemble produced state-of-the-art results on the task of predicting 180-day mortality for ovarian cancer paitents (Accuracy = 0.79, Sensitivity = 0.71, Specificity = 0.80, AUROC = 0.76). The algorithm correctly identified 25 of the 35 women in the testing dataset who died within 180 days of assessment. Machine learning algorithms trained using PRO data offer encouraging performance in predicting whether a woman with ovarian cancer will die within 180 days. This model could be used to drive data-driven end-of-life care and address current shortcomings in care delivery. Our model demonstrates the potential of biopsychosocial PROM information to make substantial contributions to oncology prediction modeling.

Association of wearable device-measured vigorous intermittent lifestyle physical activity with mortality,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-02100-x,08 Dec 2022,"Wearable devices can capture unexplored movement patterns such as brief bursts of vigorous intermittent lifestyle physical activity (VILPA) that is embedded into everyday life, rather than being done as leisure time exercise. Here, we examined the association of VILPA with all-cause, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer mortality in 25,241 nonexercisers (mean age 61.8 years, 14,178 women/11,063 men) in the UK Biobank. Over an average follow-up of 6.9 years, during which 852 deaths occurred, VILPA was inversely associated with all three of these outcomes in a near-linear fashion. Compared with participants who engaged in no VILPA, participants who engaged in VILPA at the sample median VILPA frequency of 3 length-standardized bouts per day (lasting 1 or 2 min each) showed a 38%–40% reduction in all-cause and cancer mortality risk and a 48%–49% reduction in CVD mortality risk. Moreover, the sample median VILPA duration of 4.4 min per day was associated with a 26%–30% reduction in all-cause and cancer mortality risk and a 32%–34% reduction in CVD mortality risk. We obtained similar results when repeating the above analyses for vigorous physical activity (VPA) in 62,344 UK Biobank participants who exercised (1,552 deaths, 35,290 women/27,054 men). These results indicate that small amounts of vigorous nonexercise physical activity are associated with substantially lower mortality. VILPA in nonexercisers appears to elicit similar effects to VPA in exercisers, suggesting that VILPA may be a suitable physical activity target, especially in people not able or willing to exercise.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: ; Attacker Capability:

This study aims to address the challenge of implementing a complex and highly heterogeneous dataset, including the following: (1) demonstrating how to build a multi-attributed and multi-relational graph model (2) and applying a downstream disease prediction task of a patient’s prognosis using the HinSAGE algorithm. We present a bipartite graph schema and a graph database construction in detail. The first constructed graph database illustrates a query of a predictive network that provides analytical insights using a graph representation of a patient’s journey. Moreover, we demonstrate an alternative bipartite model where we apply the model to the HinSAGE to perform the link prediction task for predicting the event occurrence. Consequently, the performance evaluation indicated that our heterogeneous graph model was successfully predicted as a baseline model. Overall, our graph database successfully demonstrated efficient real-time query performance and showed HinSAGE implementation to predict cardiovascular disease event outcomes on supervised link prediction learning.","Our study suggested a visualization method for EMR using two visualization frameworks and how they are built and applied.

A proof of concept for a deep learning system that can aid embryologists in predicting blastocyst survival after thaw,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-25062-z,07 Dec 2022,"The ability to understand whether embryos survive the thaw process is crucial to transferring competent embryos that can lead to pregnancy. The objective of this study was to develop a proof of concept deep learning model capable of assisting embryologist assessment of survival of thawed blastocysts prior to embryo transfer. A deep learning model was developed using 652 labeled time-lapse videos of freeze–thaw blastocysts. The model was evaluated against and along embryologists on a test set of 99 freeze–thaw blastocysts, using images obtained at 0.5 h increments from 0 to 3 h post-thaw. The model achieved AUCs of 0.869 (95% CI 0.789, 0.934) and 0.807 (95% CI 0.717, 0.886) and the embryologists achieved average AUCs of 0.829 (95% CI 0.747, 0.896) and 0.850 (95% CI 0.773, 0.908) at 2 h and 3 h, respectively. Combining embryologist predictions with model predictions resulted in a significant increase in AUC of 0.051 (95% CI 0.021, 0.083) at 2 h, and an equivalent increase in AUC of 0.010 (95% CI −0.018, 0.037) at 3 h. This study suggests that a deep learning model can predict in vitro blastocyst survival after thaw in aneuploid embryos. After correlation with clinical outcomes of transferred embryos, this model may help embryologists ascertain which embryos may have failed to survive the thaw process and increase the likelihood of pregnancy by preventing the transfer of non-viable embryos.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

We present an upgraded chest radiograph (CXR) explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) model, which was trained on 241,723 well-annotated CXRs obtained prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for detection of 20 radiographic features was 0.955 (95% CI 0.938–0.955) on PA view and 0.909 (95% CI 0.890–0.925) on AP view. Coexistent and correlated radiographic findings are displayed in an interpretation table, and calibrated classifier confidence is displayed on an AI scoreboard. Retrieval of similar feature patches and comparable CXRs from a Model-Derived Atlas provides justification for model predictions. To demonstrate the feasibility of a fine-tuning approach for efficient and scalable development of xAI risk prediction models, we applied our CXR xAI model, in combination with clinical information, to predict oxygen requirement in COVID-19 patients. Prediction accuracy for high flow oxygen (HFO) and mechanical ventilation (MV) was 0.953 and 0.934 at 24 h and 0.932 and 0.836 at 72 h from the time of emergency department (ED) admission, respectively.

High molecular diagnostic yields and novel phenotypic expansions involving syndromic anorectal malformations,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41431-022-01255-y,06 Dec 2022,"Evidence suggests that genetic factors contribute to the development of anorectal malformations (ARMs). However, the etiology of the majority of ARMs cases remains unclear. Exome sequencing (ES) may be underutilized in the diagnostic workup of ARMs due to uncertainty regarding its diagnostic yield. In a clinical database of ~17,000 individuals referred for ES, we identified 130 individuals with syndromic ARMs. A definitive or probable diagnosis was made in 45 of these individuals for a diagnostic yield of 34.6% (45/130). The molecular diagnostic yield of individuals who initially met criteria for VACTERL association was lower than those who did not (26.8% vs 44.1%; p = 0.0437), suggesting that non-genetic factors may play an important role in this subset of syndromic ARM cases. Within this cohort, we identified two individuals who carried de novo pathogenic frameshift variants in ADNP, two individuals who were homozygous for pathogenic variants in BBS1, and single individuals who carried pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in CREBBP, EP300, FANCC, KDM6A, SETD2, and SMARCA4. The association of these genes with ARMs was supported by previously published cases, and their similarity to known ARM genes as demonstrated using a machine learning algorithm. These data suggest that ES should be considered for all individuals with syndromic ARMs in whom a molecular diagnosis has not been made, and that ARMs represent a low penetrance phenotype associated with Helsmoortel-van der Aa syndrome, Bardet-Biedl syndrome 1, Rubinstein-Taybi syndromes 1 and 2, Fanconi anemia group C, Kabuki syndrome 2, SETD2-related disorders, and Coffin-Siris syndrome 4.",Conclusions not available,Gen AI,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Blood monocyte levels predict the risk of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a retrospective case–control study,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-25520-8,06 Dec 2022,"Monocytes were critical cells in the innate immune system. Monocyte recruitment to the lungs is a crucial process of pathophysiology in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Current evidence on the association between the occurrence of acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) and monocytes was unclear. This study aimed to examine whether blood monocytes are associated with the occurrence of AECOPD and to determine the specific blood monocyte level to predict AECOPD. A retrospective case–control study was conducted at Changhua Christian Hospital. A total of 444 eligible patients with COPD were included between January 2017 and December 2019. Restricted cubic splines were used to analyze the nonlinear relationships between continuous white blood cell values and the occurrence of AECOPD. The association between monocytes and the occurrence of AECOPD was assessed using the logistic, lasso, and ridge regression models. Restricted cubic splines revealed nonlinear associations among the monocyte level, the continuous value of the eosinophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and the occurrence of AECOPD. The lowest risk of occurrence of AECOPD ranged from 7.4 to 10%; < 7.4% with an absolute count < 0.62 or > 10% indicated significant risk. No significant association was noted between the eosinophil-to-lymphocyte ratio categories in the tertiles (< 0.049, 0.049 to < 0.122, and ≥ 0.122) and the risk of AECOPD. A significantly higher risk was noted in the association of the occurrence of AECOPD with the CAT score; mMRC score; wheezing cough; preexisting chronic pulmonary disease; hypertension and malignancy; use of dual- and triple, and oral long-acting bronchodilators for COPD treatment; and WBC count. We reported a nonlinear relationship between monocytes and the occurrence of AECOPD. Patients with monocyte percentage of > 10% or < 7.4% with an absolute count < 0.62 had higher risk of occurrence of AECOPD. Overall, our study demonstrated the specific value of monocytes in identifying high risks of the occurrence of AECOPD; this value is an easy-to-obtain, inexpensive biomarker in patients with AECOPD and should be further investigated in future prospective clinical studies.","In conclusion, we reported a nonlinear relationship between monocyte level and the occurrence of AECOPD. Patients with monocyte percentage > 10% or < 7.4% with an absolute count < 0.62 were at a high risk of AECOPD. Our findings demonstrated the specific monocyte value for identifying the high risks of AECOPD. This value served as a novel, simple, and inexpensive biomarker in patients with a high risk of AECOPD and should be further investigated in future prospective clinical studies.","Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Federated learning enables big data for rare cancer boundary detection,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-33407-5,05 Dec 2022,"Although machine learning (ML) has shown promise across disciplines, out-of-sample generalizability is concerning. This is currently addressed by sharing multi-site data, but such centralization is challenging/infeasible to scale due to various limitations. Federated ML (FL) provides an alternative paradigm for accurate and generalizable ML, by only sharing numerical model updates. Here we present the largest FL study to-date, involving data from 71 sites across 6 continents, to generate an automatic tumor boundary detector for the rare disease of glioblastoma, reporting the largest such dataset in the literature (n = 6, 314). We demonstrate a 33% delineation improvement for the surgically targetable tumor, and 23% for the complete tumor extent, over a publicly trained model. We anticipate our study to: 1) enable more healthcare studies informed by large diverse data, ensuring meaningful results for rare diseases and underrepresented populations, 2) facilitate further analyses for glioblastoma by releasing our consensus model, and 3) demonstrate the FL effectiveness at such scale and task-complexity as a paradigm shift for multi-site collaborations, alleviating the need for data-sharing.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Differential diagnosis of common etiologies of left ventricular hypertrophy using a hybrid CNN-LSTM model,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-25467-w,05 Dec 2022,"Differential diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is often obscure on echocardiography and requires numerous additional tests. We aimed to develop a deep learning algorithm to aid in the differentiation of common etiologies of LVH (i.e. hypertensive heart disease [HHD], hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [HCM], and light-chain cardiac amyloidosis [ALCA]) on echocardiographic images. Echocardiograms in 5 standard views (parasternal long-axis, parasternal short-axis, apical 4-chamber, apical 2-chamber, and apical 3-chamber) were obtained from 930 subjects: 112 with HHD, 191 with HCM, 81 with ALCA and 546 normal subjects. The study population was divided into training (n = 620), validation (n = 155), and test sets (n = 155). A convolutional neural network-long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) algorithm was constructed to independently classify the 3 diagnoses on each view, and the final diagnosis was made by an aggregate network based on the simultaneously predicted probabilities of HCM, HCM, and ALCA. Diagnostic performance of the algorithm was evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and accuracy was evaluated by the confusion matrix. The deep learning algorithm was trained and verified using the training and validation sets, respectively. In the test set, the average AUC across the five standard views was 0.962, 0.982 and 0.996 for HHD, HCM and CA, respectively. The overall diagnostic accuracy was significantly higher for the deep learning algorithm (92.3%) than for echocardiography specialists (80.0% and 80.6%). In the present study, we developed a deep learning algorithm for the differential diagnosis of 3 common LVH etiologies (HHD, HCM and ALCA) by applying a hybrid CNN-LSTM model and aggregate network to standard echocardiographic images. The high diagnostic performance of our deep learning algorithm suggests that the use of deep learning can improve the diagnostic process in patients with LVH.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
An iterative and interdisciplinary categorisation process towards FAIRer digital resources for sensitive life-sciences data,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-25278-z,05 Dec 2022,"For life science infrastructures, sensitive data generate an additional layer of complexity. Cross-domain categorisation and discovery of digital resources related to sensitive data presents major interoperability challenges. To support this FAIRification process, a toolbox demonstrator aiming at support for discovery of digital objects related to sensitive data (e.g., regulations, guidelines, best practice, tools) has been developed. The toolbox is based upon a categorisation system developed and harmonised across a cluster of 6 life science research infrastructures. Three different versions were built, tested by subsequent pilot studies, finally leading to a system with 7 main categories (sensitive data type, resource type, research field, data type, stage in data sharing life cycle, geographical scope, specific topics). 109 resources attached with the tags in pilot study 3 were used as the initial content for the toolbox demonstrator, a software tool allowing searching of digital objects linked to sensitive data with filtering based upon the categorisation system. Important next steps are a broad evaluation of the usability and user-friendliness of the toolbox, extension to more resources, broader adoption by different life-science communities, and a long-term vision for maintenance and sustainability.","To come to a stable and generally applicable categorisation system and toolbox demonstrator, an iterative process was necessary across life sciences RIs. Approval process started with nominated senior experts from 6 life-science RIs but needs community approval at a larger scale. As the categorisation system is specifying essential metadata for resources about sensitive data, it could be relevant to the FAIR Digital Objects Forum and to the Research Data Alliance (RDA) Metadata Standards Catalog (MSC) Working Group. Initial evaluation of the toolbox demonstrator has been performed with 110 resources from the LS but extension to more resources is needed. Important next steps prior to any realisation of the toolbox will be a broad evaluation of the user acceptance, usability and user-friendliness of the toolbox demonstrator, exploration of AI- or ML- algorithms to support (semi-) automatic tagging of resources and a long-term vision for maintenance and sustainability.","Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: ; Attacker Capability: 
BNT162b2 induces robust cross-variant SARS-CoV-2 immunity in children,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41541-022-00575-w,03 Dec 2022,"Currently available mRNA vaccines are extremely safe and effective to prevent severe SARS-CoV-2 infections. However, the emergence of variants of concerns (VOCs) has highlighted the importance of high population-based vaccine rates to effectively suppress viral transmission and breakthrough infections. While initially left out from vaccine efforts, children have become one of the most affected age groups and are key targets to stop community and household spread. Antibodies are central for vaccine-induced protection and emerging data points to the importance of additional Fc effector functions like opsononophagocytosis or cytotoxicity, particularly in the context of VOCs that escape neutralizing antibodies. Here, we observed delayed induction and reduced magnitude of vaccine-induced antibody titers in children 5-11 years receiving two doses of the age-recommended 10 μg dose of the Pfizer SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 vaccine compared to adolescents (12–15 years) or adults receiving the 30 μg dose. Conversely, children mounted equivalent or more robust neutralization and opsonophagocytic functions at peak immunogenicity, pointing to a qualitatively more robust humoral functional response in children. Moreover, broad cross-VOC responses were observed across children, with enhanced IgM and parallel IgG cross-reactivity to VOCs in children compared to adults. Collectively, these data argue that despite the lower magnitude of the BNT162b2-induced antibody response in children, vaccine-induced immunity in children target VOCs broadly and exhibit enhanced functionality that may contribute to the attenuation of disease.",Conclusions not available,Gen AI,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Deciphering clinical abbreviations with a privacy protecting machine learning system,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-35007-9,02 Dec 2022,"Physicians write clinical notes with abbreviations and shorthand that are difficult to decipher. Abbreviations can be clinical jargon (writing “HIT” for “heparin induced thrombocytopenia”), ambiguous terms that require expertise to disambiguate (using “MS” for “multiple sclerosis” or “mental status”), or domain-specific vernacular (“cb” for “complicated by”). Here we train machine learning models on public web data to decode such text by replacing abbreviations with their meanings. We report a single translation model that simultaneously detects and expands thousands of abbreviations in real clinical notes with accuracies ranging from 92.1%-97.1% on multiple external test datasets. The model equals or exceeds the performance of board-certified physicians (97.6% vs 88.7% total accuracy). Our results demonstrate a general method to contextually decipher abbreviations and shorthand that is built without any privacy-compromising data.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
"A computational approach to measure the linguistic characteristics of psychotherapy timing, responsiveness, and consistency",https://www.nature.com/articles/s44184-022-00020-9,02 Dec 2022,"Although individual psychotherapy is generally effective for a range of mental health conditions, little is known about the moment-to-moment language use of effective therapists. Increased access to computational power, coupled with a rise in computer-mediated communication (telehealth), makes feasible the large-scale analyses of language use during psychotherapy. Transparent methodological approaches are lacking, however. Here we present novel methods to increase the efficiency of efforts to examine language use in psychotherapy. We evaluate three important aspects of therapist language use - timing, responsiveness, and consistency - across five clinically relevant language domains: pronouns, time orientation, emotional polarity, therapist tactics, and paralinguistic style. We find therapist language is dynamic within sessions, responds to patient language, and relates to patient symptom diagnosis but not symptom severity. Our results demonstrate that analyzing therapist language at scale is feasible and may help answer longstanding questions about specific behaviors of effective therapists.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Nasal DNA methylation at three CpG sites predicts childhood allergic disease,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-35088-6,01 Dec 2022,"Childhood allergic diseases, including asthma, rhinitis and eczema, are prevalent conditions that share strong genetic and environmental components. Diagnosis relies on clinical history and measurements of allergen-specific IgE. We hypothesize that a multi-omics model could accurately diagnose childhood allergic disease. We show that nasal DNA methylation has the strongest predictive power to diagnose childhood allergy, surpassing blood DNA methylation, genetic risk scores, and environmental factors. DNA methylation at only three nasal CpG sites classifies allergic disease in Dutch children aged 16 years well, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.86. This is replicated in Puerto Rican children aged 9–20 years (AUC 0.82). DNA methylation at these CpGs additionally detects allergic multimorbidity and symptomatic IgE sensitization. Using nasal single-cell RNA-sequencing data, these three CpGs associate with influx of T cells and macrophages that contribute to allergic inflammation. Our study suggests the potential of methylation-based allergy diagnosis.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Generalizability of an acute kidney injury prediction model across health systems,https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-022-00563-8,01 Dec 2022,"Delays in the identification of acute kidney injury in hospitalized patients are a major barrier to the development of effective interventions for treatment. A recent study described a series of models that outperformed previously published models in predicting acute kidney injury up to 48 h in advance, including a recurrent neural network that achieved state-of-the-art performance (area under the curve 0.92) and a gradient-boosted decision tree model that was close behind (area under the curve 0.89). Because these models were trained in a population of US veterans that was 94% male, questions have arisen about its generalizability to other health systems where the populations are more sex balanced. In this study, we aimed to evaluate how well an acute kidney injury model trained in a population of US veterans performs in females at the Veterans Affairs and the extent to which its performance generalizes to a large academic hospital setting. We found that the model performed worse in predicting acute kidney injury in females in both populations, with miscalibration in lower stages of acute kidney injury and worse discrimination (a lower area under the curve) in higher stages of acute kidney injury. We demonstrate that, while this discrepancy in performance can be largely corrected in non-veterans by updating the original model using data from a sex-balanced academic hospital cohort, the worse model performance persists in veterans. Our study sheds light on the importance of characterizing the generalizability of artificial intelligence studies, and on the complexity of discrepancies in model performance in subgroups that cannot be explained simply on the basis of sample size.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Multi-day dataset of forearm and wrist electromyogram for hand gesture recognition and biometrics,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01836-y,30 Nov 2022,"Surface electromyography (sEMG) signals have been used for advanced prosthetics control, hand-gesture recognition (HGR), and more recently as a novel biometric trait. For these sEMG-based applications, the translation from laboratory research setting to real-life scenarios suffers from two major limitations: (1) a small subject pool, and (2) single-session data recordings, both of which prevents acceptable generalization ability. In this longitudinal database, forearm and wrist sEMG data were collected from 43 participants over three different days with long separation (Days 1, 8, and 29) while they performed static hand/wrist gestures. The objective of this dataset is to provide a comprehensive dataset for the development of robust machine learning algorithms of sEMG, for both HGR and biometric applications. We demonstrated the high quality of the current dataset by comparing with the Ninapro dataset. And we presented its usability for both HGR and biometric applications. Among other applications, the dataset can also be used for developing electrode-shift invariant generalized models, which can further bolster the development of wristband and forearm-bracelet sensors.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: ; Attacker Capability: 
Comorbidity clusters associated with newly treated type 2 diabetes mellitus: a Bayesian nonparametric analysis,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-24217-2,30 Nov 2022,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with the development of chronic comorbidities, which can lead to high drug utilization and adverse events. We aimed to identify common comorbidity clusters and explore the progression over time in newly treated T2DM patients. The IQVIA Medical Research Data incorporating data from THIN, a Cegedim database of anonymized electronic health records, was used to identify all patients with a first-ever prescription for a non-insulin antidiabetic drug (NIAD) between January 2006 and December 2019. We selected 58 chronic comorbidities of interest and used Bayesian nonparametric models to identify disease clusters and model their progression over time. Among the 175,383 eligible T2DM patients, we identified the 20 most frequent comorbidity clusters, which were comprised of 14 latent features (LFs). Each LF was associated with a primary disease (e.g., 98% of patients in cluster 2, characterized by LF2, had congestive heart failure [CHF]). The presence of certain LFs increased the probability of having another LF active. For example, LF2 (CHF) frequently appeared with LFs related to chronic kidney disease (CKD). Over time, the clusters associated with cardiovascular diseases, such as CHF, progressed rapidly. Moreover, the onset of certain diseases led to further complications. Our models identified established T2DM complications and previously unknown connections, thus, highlighting the potential for Bayesian nonparametric models to characterize complex comorbidity patterns.",Conclusions not available,Gen AI,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Brain single cell transcriptomic profiles in episodic memory phenotypes associated with temporal lobe epilepsy,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41525-022-00339-4,29 Nov 2022,"Memory dysfunction is prevalent in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), but little is known about the underlying molecular etiologies. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing technology was used to examine differences in cellular heterogeneity among left (language-dominant) temporal neocortical tissues from patients with TLE with (n = 4) or without (n = 2) impairment in verbal episodic memory. We observed marked cell heterogeneity between memory phenotypes and identified numerous differentially expressed genes across all brain cell types. The most notable differences were observed in glutamatergic (excitatory) and GABAergic (inhibitory) neurons with an overrepresentation of genes associated with long-term potentiation, long-term depression, and MAPK signaling, processes known to be essential for episodic memory formation.",Conclusions not available,,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Low intensity repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation modulates brain-wide functional connectivity to promote anti-correlated c-Fos expression,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-24934-8,29 Nov 2022,"Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) induces action potentials to induce plastic changes in the brain with increasing evidence for the therapeutic importance of brain-wide functional network effects of rTMS; however, the influence of sub-action potential threshold (low-intensity; LI-) rTMS on neuronal activity is largely unknown. We investigated whether LI-rTMS modulates neuronal activity and functional connectivity and also specifically assessed modulation of parvalbumin interneuron activity. We conducted a brain-wide analysis of c-Fos, a marker for neuronal activity, in mice that received LI-rTMS to visual cortex. Mice received single or multiple sessions of excitatory 10 Hz LI-rTMS with custom rodent coils or were sham controls. We assessed changes to c-Fos positive cell densities and c-Fos/parvalbumin co-expression. Peak c-Fos expression corresponded with activity during rTMS. We also assessed functional connectivity changes using brain-wide c-Fos-based network analysis. LI-rTMS modulated c-Fos expression in cortical and subcortical regions. c-Fos density changes were most prevalent with acute stimulation, however chronic stimulation decreased parvalbumin interneuron activity, most prominently in the amygdala and striatum. LI-rTMS also increased anti-correlated functional connectivity, with the most prominent effects also in the amygdala and striatum following chronic stimulation. LI-rTMS induces changes in c-Fos expression that suggest modulation of neuronal activity and functional connectivity throughout the brain. Our results suggest that LI-rTMS promotes anticorrelated functional connectivity, possibly due to decreased parvalbumin interneuron activation induced by chronic stimulation. These changes may underpin therapeutic rTMS effects, therefore modulation of subcortical activity supports rTMS for treatment of disorders involving subcortical dysregulation.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: ; Attacker Capability: 
Immune gene expression analysis indicates the potential of a self-amplifying Covid-19 mRNA vaccine,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41541-022-00573-y,28 Nov 2022,"Remarkable potency has been demonstrated for mRNA vaccines in reducing the global burden of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. An alternative form of the mRNA vaccine is the self-amplifying mRNA (sa-mRNA) vaccine, which encodes an alphavirus replicase that self-amplifies the full-length mRNA and SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) transgene. However, early-phase clinical trials of sa-mRNA COVID-19 vaccine candidates have questioned the potential of this platform to develop potent vaccines. We examined the immune gene response to a candidate sa-mRNA vaccine against COVID-19, ARCT-021, and compared our findings to the host response to other forms of vaccines. In blood samples from healthy volunteers that participated in a phase I/II clinical trial, greater induction of transcripts involved in Toll-like receptor (TLR) signalling, antigen presentation and complement activation at 1 day post-vaccination was associated with higher anti-S antibody titers. Conversely, transcripts involved in T-cell maturation at day 7 post-vaccination informed the magnitude of eventual S-specific T-cell responses. The transcriptomic signature for ARCT-021 vaccination strongly correlated with live viral vector vaccines, adjuvanted vaccines and BNT162b2 1 day post-vaccination. Moreover, the ARCT-021 signature correlated with day 7 YF17D live-attenuated vaccine transcriptomic responses. Altogether, our findings show that sa-mRNA vaccination induces innate immune responses that are associated with the development of adaptive immunity from other forms of vaccines, supporting further development of this vaccine platform for clinical application.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: ; Attacker Capability: 
Machine learning did not beat logistic regression in time series prediction for severe asthma exacerbations,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-24909-9,27 Nov 2022,"Early detection of severe asthma exacerbations through home monitoring data in patients with stable mild-to-moderate chronic asthma could help to timely adjust medication. We evaluated the potential of machine learning methods compared to a clinical rule and logistic regression to predict severe exacerbations. We used daily home monitoring data from two studies in asthma patients (development: n = 165 and validation: n = 101 patients). Two ML models (XGBoost, one class SVM) and a logistic regression model provided predictions based on peak expiratory flow and asthma symptoms. These models were compared with an asthma action plan rule. Severe exacerbations occurred in 0.2% of all daily measurements in the development (154/92,787 days) and validation cohorts (94/40,185 days). The AUC of the best performing XGBoost was 0.85 (0.82–0.87) and 0.88 (0.86–0.90) for logistic regression in the validation cohort. The XGBoost model provided overly extreme risk estimates, whereas the logistic regression underestimated predicted risks. Sensitivity and specificity were better overall for XGBoost and logistic regression compared to one class SVM and the clinical rule. We conclude that ML models did not beat logistic regression in predicting short-term severe asthma exacerbations based on home monitoring data. Clinical application remains challenging in settings with low event incidence and high false alarm rates with high sensitivity.",Conclusions not available,Traditional ML,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
"Wireless, closed-loop, smart bandage with integrated sensors and stimulators for advanced wound care and accelerated healing",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-022-01528-3,24 Nov 2022,"‘Smart’ bandages based on multimodal wearable devices could enable real-time physiological monitoring and active intervention to promote healing of chronic wounds. However, there has been limited development in incorporation of both sensors and stimulators for the current smart bandage technologies. Additionally, while adhesive electrodes are essential for robust signal transduction, detachment of existing adhesive dressings can lead to secondary damage to delicate wound tissues without switchable adhesion. Here we overcome these issues by developing a flexible bioelectronic system consisting of wirelessly powered, closed-loop sensing and stimulation circuits with skin-interfacing hydrogel electrodes capable of on-demand adhesion and detachment. In mice, we demonstrate that our wound care system can continuously monitor skin impedance and temperature and deliver electrical stimulation in response to the wound environment. Across preclinical wound models, the treatment group healed ~25% more rapidly and with ~50% enhancement in dermal remodeling compared with control. Further, we observed activation of proregenerative genes in monocyte and macrophage cell populations, which may enhance tissue regeneration, neovascularization and dermal recovery.","In summary, we designed and fabricated a miniaturized smart bandage with dual-channel continuous sensing of wound impedance and temperature, as well as a parallel stimulation circuit to deliver programmed electrical cues for accelerated wound healing. Through the integration of sensors and stimulators into one wearable patch, as well as rational design of tissue-interfacing hydrogel electrodes, our wireless smart bandage enables (1) active monitoring and closed-loop treatment of a wound and (2) accelerated healing through a proregenerative mode of action, activated by increased cellular proliferation and recruitment of cells involved in wound repair. This dual-mode integration advances the field of wound healing pathobiology, enabling the optimization of treatment modalities that would allow for better patient mobility and improvement in standard of care.However, additional challenges exist, including production scalability (for example, reduced cost, long-term storage), incorporation of additional sensors (for example, metabolites, biomarkers, pH) and clinical translatability (for example, biocompatibility, biofouling issues). While our preclinical demonstrations showed proof of concept, future work involves extending our smart bandage to a human-sized form factor and running preliminary tests in large-animal models followed by human trials. In addition, we aim to reduce the manufacturing cost of our clinical device to enable broad adoption within a payer system. Finally, our device platform may also be adapted to the management of other diseases, enabling the next generation of closed-loop bioelectronic medicine.","Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Finding the influential clinical traits that impact on the diagnosis of heart disease using statistical and machine-learning techniques,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-24633-4,23 Nov 2022,"In recent years, the omnipresence of cardiac problems has been recognized as an epidemic. With the correct and quick diagnosis, both mortality and morbidity from cardiac disorders can be dramatically reduced. However, frequent medical check-ups are pricey and out of reach for a large number of people, particularly those living in low-income areas. In this paper, certain time-honored statistical techniques are used to determine the factors that lead to heart disease. Also, the findings were validated using various promising machine learning tools. Feature importance approach was employed to rank the clinical parameters of the patients based on the correlation of heart disease. In the case of statistical investigations, nonparametric tests such as the Mann Whitney U test and the Chi square test, as well as correlation analysis with Pearson correlation and Spearman Correlation were used. For additional validation, seven of the potential feature important based ML algorithms were applied. Moreover, Borda count was implemented to acknowledge the combined observation of those ML models. On top of that, SHAP value was calculated as a feature importance technique and for detailed evaluation. This research reveals two aspects of heart disease diagnosis.We found that eight clinical traits are sufficient to diagnose cardiac disorders, in which three traits are the most important sign of heart disease. One of the discoveries of this investigation uncovered chest pain, number of major blood vessels, thalassemia, age, maximum heart rate, cholesterol, oldpeak, and sex as sufficient clinical signs of individuals for the diagnosis of cardiac disorders. Over the above, considering the findings of all three approaches, chest pain, the number of major blood vessels, and thalassemia were identified as the prime factors of heart disease. The research also found, fasting blood sugar does not have a direct impact on cardiac disease. These findings will have the potency to be incredibly useful in clinical investigations as well as risk assessment for patients. Limiting the most critical features can have a significant impact on the diagnosis of heart disease and reduce the severity of health risks and death of patients.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Nature inspired method for noninvasive fetal ECG extraction,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-24733-1,23 Nov 2022,"This paper introduces a novel algorithm for effective and accurate extraction of non-invasive fetal electrocardiogram (NI-fECG). In NI-fECG based monitoring, the useful signal is measured along with other signals generated by the pregnant women’s body, especially maternal electrocardiogram (mECG). These signals are more distinct in magnitude and overlap in time and frequency domains, making the fECG extraction extremely challenging. The proposed extraction method combines the Grey wolf algorithm (GWO) with sequential analysis (SA). This innovative combination, forming the GWO-SA method, optimises the parameters required to create a template that matches the mECG, which leads to an accurate elimination of the said signal from the input composite signal. The extraction system was tested on two databases consisting of real signals, namely, Labour and Pregnancy. The databases used to test the algorithms are available on a server at the generalist repositories (figshare) integrated with Matonia et al. (Sci Data 7(1):1–14, 2020). The results show that the proposed method extracts the fetal ECG signal with an outstanding efficacy. The efficacy of the results was evaluated based on accurate detection of the fQRS complexes. The parameters used to evaluate are as follows: accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SE), positive predictive value (PPV), and F1 score. Due to the stochastic nature of the GWO algorithm, ten individual runs were performed for each record in the two databases to assure stability as well as repeatability. Using these parameters, for the Labour dataset, we achieved an average ACC of 94.60%, F1 of 96.82%, SE of 97.49%, and PPV of 98.96%. For the Pregnancy database, we achieved an average ACC of 95.66%, F1 of 97.44%, SE of 98.07%, and PPV of 97.44%. The obtained results show that the fHR related parameters were determined accurately for most of the records, outperforming the other state-of-the-art approaches. The poorer quality of certain signals have caused deviation from the estimated fHR for certain records in the databases. The proposed algorithm is compared with certain well established algorithms, and has proven to be accurate in its fECG extractions.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: ; Attacker Capability:

Nevertheless, because they are destructive, costly, time-consuming, and expensive in infrastructure and materials, they might not be well adapted for the survey of arthropod vectors involved in the transmission of pathogens responsible for Neglected Tropical Diseases, like HAT. This study demonstrates a new type of methodology to classify Glossina species. In conjunction with a deep learning architecture, a database of Wing Interference Patterns (WIPs) representative of the Glossina species involved in the transmission of HAT and AAT was used. This database has 1766 pictures representing 23 Glossina species. This cost-effective methodology, which requires mounting wings on slides and using a commercially available microscope, demonstrates that WIPs are an excellent medium to automatically recognize Glossina species with very high accuracy.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: ; Attacker Capability: 
Quantifying deep neural network uncertainty for atrial fibrillation detection with limited labels,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-24574-y,22 Nov 2022,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia found in the intensive care unit (ICU), and is associated with many adverse outcomes. Effective handling of AF and similar arrhythmias is a vital part of modern critical care, but obtaining knowledge about both disease burden and effective interventions often requires costly clinical trials. A wealth of continuous, high frequency physiological data such as the waveforms derived from electrocardiogram telemetry are promising sources for enriching clinical research. Automated detection using machine learning and in particular deep learning has been explored as a solution for processing these data. However, a lack of labels, increased presence of noise, and inability to assess the quality and trustworthiness of many machine learning model predictions pose challenges to interpretation. In this work, we propose an approach for training deep AF models on limited, noisy data and report uncertainty in their predictions. Using techniques from the fields of weakly supervised learning, we leverage a surrogate model trained on non-ICU data to create imperfect labels for a large ICU telemetry dataset. We combine these weak labels with techniques to estimate model uncertainty without the need for extensive human data annotation. AF detection models trained using this process demonstrated higher classification performance (0.64–0.67 F1 score) and improved calibration (0.05–0.07 expected calibration error).",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Machine learning models for prediction of HF and CKD development in early-stage type 2 diabetes patients,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-24562-2,21 Nov 2022,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and heart failure (HF) are the first and most frequent comorbidities associated with mortality risks in early-stage type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, efficient screening and risk assessment strategies for identifying T2DM patients at high risk of developing CKD and/or HF (CKD/HF) remains to be established. This study aimed to generate a novel machine learning (ML) model to predict the risk of developing CKD/HF in early-stage T2DM patients. The models were derived from a retrospective cohort of 217,054 T2DM patients without a history of cardiovascular and renal diseases extracted from a Japanese claims database. Among algorithms used for the ML, extreme gradient boosting exhibited the best performance for CKD/HF diagnosis and hospitalization after internal validation and was further validated using another dataset including 16,822 patients. In the external validation, 5-years prediction area under the receiver operating characteristic curves for CKD/HF diagnosis and hospitalization were 0.718 and 0.837, respectively. In Kaplan–Meier curves analysis, patients predicted to be at high risk showed significant increase in CKD/HF diagnosis and hospitalization compared with those at low risk. Thus, the developed model predicted the risk of developing CKD/HF in T2DM patients with reasonable probability in the external validation cohort. Clinical approach identifying T2DM at high risk of developing CKD/HF using ML models may contribute to improved prognosis by promoting early diagnosis and intervention.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Multi-modal wound classification using wound image and location by deep neural network,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-21813-0,21 Nov 2022,"Wound classification is an essential step of wound diagnosis. An efficient classifier can assist wound specialists in classifying wound types with less financial and time costs and help them decide on an optimal treatment procedure. This study developed a deep neural network-based multi-modal classifier using wound images and their corresponding locations to categorize them into multiple classes, including diabetic, pressure, surgical, and venous ulcers. A body map was also developed to prepare the location data, which can help wound specialists tag wound locations more efficiently. Three datasets containing images and their corresponding location information were designed with the help of wound specialists. The multi-modal network was developed by concatenating the image-based and location-based classifier outputs with other modifications. The maximum accuracy on mixed-class classifications (containing background and normal skin) varies from 82.48 to 100% in different experiments. The maximum accuracy on wound-class classifications (containing only diabetic, pressure, surgical, and venous) varies from 72.95 to 97.12% in various experiments. The proposed multi-modal network also showed a significant improvement in results from the previous works of literature.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Discovery and classification of complex multimorbidity patterns: unravelling chronicity networks and their social profiles,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-23617-8,21 Nov 2022,"Multimorbidity can be defined as the presence of two or more chronic diseases in an individual. This condition is associated with reduced quality of life, increased disability, greater functional impairment, increased health care utilisation, greater fragmentation of care and complexity of treatment, and increased mortality. Thus, understanding its epidemiology and inherent complexity is essential to improve the quality of life of patients and to reduce the costs associated with multi-pathology. In this paper, using data from the European Health Survey, we explore the application of Mixed Graphical Models and its combination with social network analysis techniques for the discovery and classification of complex multimorbidity patterns. The results obtained show the usefulness and versatility of this approach for the study of multimorbidity based on the use of graphs, which offer the researcher a holistic view of the relational structure of data with variables of different types and high dimensionality.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Artificial intelligence workflow quantifying muscle features on Hematoxylin–Eosin stained sections reveals dystrophic phenotype amelioration upon treatment,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-24139-z,19 Nov 2022,"Cell segmentation is a key step for a wide variety of biological investigations, especially in the context of muscle science. Currently, automated methods still struggle to perform skeletal muscle fiber quantification on Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE) stained histopathological whole slide images due to low contrast. On the other hand, the Deep Learning algorithm Cellpose offers new perspectives considering its increasing adoption for segmentation of a wide range of cells. Combining two open-source tools, Cellpose and QuPath, we developed MyoSOTHES, an automated Myofibers Segmentation wOrkflow Tuned for HE Staining. MyoSOTHES enables solving segmentation inconsistencies encountered by default Cellpose model in presence of large range size cells and provides information related to muscle Feret’s diameter distribution and Centrally Nucleated Fibers, thus depicting muscle health and treatment effects. MyoSOTHES achieves high quality segmentation compared to baseline workflow with a detection F1-score increasing from 0.801 to 0.919 and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) on diameter improved by 31%. MyoSOTHES was validated on an animal study featuring gene transfer in \(\gamma\)-Sarcoglycanopathy, for which dose-response effect is visible and conclusions drawn are consistent with those previously published. MyoSOTHES thus paves the way for wide quantification of HE stained muscle sections and retrospective analysis of HE labeled slices used in laboratories for decades.",Conclusions not available,DNN,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
"Profiling mRNA, miRNA and lncRNA expression changes in endothelial cells in response to increasing doses of ionizing radiation",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-24051-6,19 Nov 2022,"Recent and past research have highlighted the importance of the endothelium in the manifestation of radiation injury. Our primary focus is on medical triage and management following whole body or partial-body irradiation. Here we investigated the usability of endothelial cells’ radiation response for biodosimetry applications. We profiled the transcriptome in cultured human endothelial cells treated with increasing doses of X-rays. mRNA expression changes were useful 24 h and 72 h post-radiation, microRNA and lncRNA expression changes were useful 72 h after radiation. More mRNA expressions were repressed than induced while more miRNA and lncRNA expressions were induced than repressed. These novel observations imply distinct radiation responsive regulatory mechanisms for coding and non-coding transcripts. It also follows how different RNA species should be explored as biomarkers for different time-points. Radiation-responsive markers which could classify no radiation (i.e., ‘0 Gy’) and dose-differentiating markers were also predicted. IPA analysis showed growth arrest-related processes at 24 h but immune response coordination at the 72 h post-radiation. Collectively, these observations suggest that endothelial cells have a precise dose and time-dependent response to radiation. Further studies in the laboratory are examining if these differences could be captured in the extracellular vesicles released by irradiated endothelial cells.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Model-free phasor image analysis of quantitative myocardial T1 mapping,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-23872-9,18 Nov 2022,"Model-free phasor image analysis, well established in fluorescence lifetime imaging and only recently applied to qMRI \({T}_{2}\) data processing, is here adapted and validated for myocardial qMRI \({T}_{1}\) mapping. Contrarily to routine mono-exponential fitting procedures, phasor enables mapping the lifetime information from all image voxels to a single plot, without resorting to any regression fitting analysis, and describing multi-exponential qMRI decays without biases due to violated modelling assumptions. In this feasibility study, we test the performance of our recently developed full-harmonics phasor method for unravelling partial-volume effects, motion or pathological tissue alteration, respectively on a numerically-simulated dataset, a healthy subject scan, and two pilot patient datasets. Our results show that phasor analysis can be used, as alternative method to fitting analysis or other model-free approaches, to identify motion artifacts or partial-volume effects at the myocardium-blood interface as characteristic deviations, or delineations of scar and remote myocardial tissue in patient data.","In this work, we have evaluated the feasibility of phasor processing method for the analysis of cardiac \({T}_{1}\) mapping data. Our data indicate the potential use of phasor analysis, in the form of phasor-coordinate maps, phasor plots and/or phasor-based segmentation images, for the eased depiction of partial volume effects and motion, while retaining good visualization of abnormal relaxation times in patients. Hence, phasor may offer potential as an alternative, model-free, qMRI data analysis method for fast and robust tissue characterization based on conventional myocardial \({T}_{1}\) mapping data. Future research is warranted to further validate the clinical value of a phasor-based quality assurance to aid robustness in clinical cardiac \({T}_{1}\) mapping of motion artefacts and scar tissue.","Traditional ML, DNN",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Development of a deep learning method for improving diagnostic accuracy for uterine sarcoma cases,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-23064-5,16 Nov 2022,"Uterine sarcomas have very poor prognoses and are sometimes difficult to distinguish from uterine leiomyomas on preoperative examinations. Herein, we investigated whether deep neural network (DNN) models can improve the accuracy of preoperative MRI-based diagnosis in patients with uterine sarcomas. Fifteen sequences of MRI for patients (uterine sarcoma group: n = 63; uterine leiomyoma: n = 200) were used to train the models. Six radiologists (three specialists, three practitioners) interpreted the same images for validation. The most important individual sequences for diagnosis were axial T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), sagittal T2WI, and diffusion-weighted imaging. These sequences also represented the most accurate combination (accuracy: 91.3%), achieving diagnostic ability comparable to that of specialists (accuracy: 88.3%) and superior to that of practitioners (accuracy: 80.1%). Moreover, radiologists’ diagnostic accuracy improved when provided with DNN results (specialists: 89.6%; practitioners: 92.3%). Our DNN models are valuable to improve diagnostic accuracy, especially in filling the gap of clinical skills between interpreters. This method can be a universal model for the use of deep learning in the diagnostic imaging of rare tumors.",Conclusions not available,DNN,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
ABE8e adenine base editor precisely and efficiently corrects a recurrent COL7A1 nonsense mutation,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-24184-8,16 Nov 2022,"Base editing introduces precise single-nucleotide edits in genomic DNA and has the potential to treat genetic diseases such as the blistering skin disease recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB), which is characterized by mutations in the COL7A1 gene and type VII collagen (C7) deficiency. Adenine base editors (ABEs) convert A-T base pairs to G-C base pairs without requiring double-stranded DNA breaks or donor DNA templates. Here, we use ABE8e, a recently evolved ABE, to correct primary RDEB patient fibroblasts harboring the recurrent RDEB nonsense mutation c.5047 C > T (p.Arg1683Ter) in exon 54 of COL7A1 and use a next generation sequencing workflow to interrogate post-treatment outcomes. Electroporation of ABE8e mRNA into a bulk population of RDEB patient fibroblasts resulted in remarkably efficient (94.6%) correction of the pathogenic allele, restoring COL7A1 mRNA and expression of C7 protein in western blots and in 3D skin constructs. Off-target DNA analysis did not detect off-target editing in treated patient-derived fibroblasts and there was no detectable increase in A-to-I changes in the RNA. Taken together, we have established a highly efficient pipeline for gene correction in primary fibroblasts with a favorable safety profile. This work lays a foundation for developing therapies for RDEB patients using ex vivo or in vivo base editing strategies.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Novel 3D video action recognition deep learning approach for near real time epileptic seizure classification,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-23133-9,15 Nov 2022,"Seizure semiology is a well-established method to classify epileptic seizure types, but requires a significant amount of resources as long-term Video-EEG monitoring needs to be visually analyzed. Therefore, computer vision based diagnosis support tools are a promising approach. In this article, we utilize infrared (IR) and depth (3D) videos to show the feasibility of a 24/7 novel object and action recognition based deep learning (DL) monitoring system to differentiate between epileptic seizures in frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE), temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and non-epileptic events. Based on the largest 3Dvideo-EEG database in the world (115 seizures/+680,000 video-frames/427GB), we achieved a promising cross-subject validation f1-score of 0.833±0.061 for the 2 class (FLE vs. TLE) and 0.763 ± 0.083 for the 3 class (FLE vs. TLE vs. non-epileptic) case, from 2 s samples, with an automated semi-specialized depth (Acc.95.65%) and Mask R-CNN (Acc.96.52%) based cropping pipeline to pre-process the videos, enabling a near-real-time seizure type detection and classification tool.

Development and validation of deep learning ECG-based prediction of myocardial infarction in emergency department patients,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-24254-x,15 Nov 2022,"Myocardial infarction diagnosis is a common challenge in the emergency department. In managed settings, deep learning-based models and especially convolutional deep models have shown promise in electrocardiogram (ECG) classification, but there is a lack of high-performing models for the diagnosis of myocardial infarction in real-world scenarios. We aimed to train and validate a deep learning model using ECGs to predict myocardial infarction in real-world emergency department patients. We studied emergency department patients in the Stockholm region between 2007 and 2016 that had an ECG obtained because of their presenting complaint. We developed a deep neural network based on convolutional layers similar to a residual network. Inputs to the model were ECG tracing, age, and sex; and outputs were the probabilities of three mutually exclusive classes: non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), and control status, as registered in the SWEDEHEART and other registries. We used an ensemble of five models. Among 492,226 ECGs in 214,250 patients, 5,416 were recorded with an NSTEMI, 1,818 a STEMI, and 485,207 without a myocardial infarction. In a random test set, our model could discriminate STEMIs/NSTEMIs from controls with a C-statistic of 0.991/0.832 and had a Brier score of 0.001/0.008. The model obtained a similar performance in a temporally separated test set of the study sample, and achieved a C-statistic of 0.985 and a Brier score of 0.002 in discriminating STEMIs from controls in an external test set. We developed and validated a deep learning model with excellent performance in discriminating between control, STEMI, and NSTEMI on the presenting ECG of a real-world sample of the important population of all-comers to the emergency department. Hence, deep learning models for ECG decision support could be valuable in the emergency department.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Identifying the optimal conditioning intensity for stem cell transplantation in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome: a machine learning analysis,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41409-022-01871-8,14 Nov 2022,"A conditioning regimen is an essential prerequisite of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). However, the optimal conditioning intensity for a patient may be difficult to establish. This study aimed to identify optimal conditioning intensity (reduced-intensity conditioning regimen [RIC] or myeloablative conditioning regimen [MAC]) for patients with MDS. Overall, 2567 patients with MDS who received their first HCT between 2009 and 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. They were divided into a training cohort and a validation cohort. Using a machine learning-based model, we developed a benefit score for RIC in the training cohort. The validation cohort was divided into a high-score and a low-score group, based on the median benefit score. The endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). The benefit score for RIC was developed from nine baseline variables in the training cohort. In the validation cohort, the hazard ratios of the PFS in the RIC group compared to the MAC group were 0.65 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.48–0.90, P = 0.009) in the high-score group and 1.36 (95% CI: 1.06–1.75, P = 0.017) in the low-score group (P for interaction < 0.001).

Enhanced survival prediction using explainable artificial intelligence in heart transplantation,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-23817-2,14 Nov 2022,"The most limiting factor in heart transplantation is the lack of donor organs. With enhanced prediction of outcome, it may be possible to increase the life-years from the organs that become available. Applications of machine learning to tabular data, typical of clinical decision support, pose the practical question of interpretation, which has technical and potential ethical implications. In particular, there is an issue of principle about the predictability of complex data and whether this is inherent in the data or strongly dependent on the choice of machine learning model, leading to the so-called accuracy-interpretability trade-off. We model 1-year mortality in heart transplantation data with a self-explaining neural network, which is benchmarked against a deep learning model on the same development data, in an external validation study with two data sets: (1) UNOS transplants in 2017–2018 (n = 4750) for which the self-explaining and deep learning models are comparable in their AUROC 0.628 [0.602,0.654] cf. 0.635 [0.609,0.662] and (2) Scandinavian transplants during 1997–2018 (n = 2293), showing good calibration with AUROCs of 0.626 [0.588,0.665] and 0.634 [0.570, 0.698], respectively, with and without missing data (n = 982).

Here we show, in glioma cell cultures, in subcutaneous and orthotopic gliomas in rats, and in glioma tumours in patients, that transmembrane water-efflux rate is a sensitive biomarker of AQP4 expression and can be measured via conventional dynamic-contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. Water-efflux rates correlated with stages of glioma proliferation as well as with changes in the heterogeneity of intra-tumoural and inter-tumoural AQP4 in rodent and human gliomas following treatment with temozolomide and with the AQP4 inhibitor TGN020. Regions with low water-efflux rates contained higher fractions of stem-like slow-cycling cells and therapy-resistant cells, suggesting that maps of water-efflux rates could be used to identify gliomas that are resistant to therapies.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Ensemble machine learning identifies genetic loci associated with future worsening of disability in people with multiple sclerosis,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-23685-w,11 Nov 2022,"Limited studies have been conducted to identify and validate multiple sclerosis (MS) genetic loci associated with disability progression. We aimed to identify MS genetic loci associated with worsening of disability over time, and to develop and validate ensemble genetic learning model(s) to identify people with MS (PwMS) at risk of future worsening. We examined associations of 208 previously established MS genetic loci with the risk of worsening of disability; we learned ensemble genetic decision rules and validated the predictions in an external dataset. We found 7 genetic loci (rs7731626: HR 0.92, P = 2.4 × 10–5; rs12211604: HR 1.16, P = 3.2 × 10–7; rs55858457: HR 0.93, P = 3.7 × 10–7; rs10271373: HR 0.90, P = 1.1 × 10–7; rs11256593: HR 1.13, P = 5.1 × 10–57; rs12588969: HR = 1.10, P = 2.1 × 10–10; rs1465697: HR 1.09, P = 1.7 × 10–128) associated with risk worsening of disability; most of which were located near or tagged to 13 genomic regions enriched in peptide hormones and steroids biosynthesis pathways by positional and eQTL mapping. The derived ensembles produced a set of genetic decision rules that can be translated to provide additional prognostic values to existing clinical predictions, with the additional benefit of incorporating relevant genetic information into clinical decision making for PwMS.

Predicting willingness to donate blood based on machine learning: two blood donor recruitments during COVID-19 outbreaks,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-21215-2,10 Nov 2022,"Machine learning methods are a novel way to predict and rank donors' willingness to donate blood and to achieve precision recruitment, which can improve the recruitment efficiency and meet the challenge of blood shortage. We collected information about experienced blood donors via short message service (SMS) recruitment and developed 7 machine learning-based recruitment models using PyCharm-Python Environment and 13 features which were described as a method for ranking and predicting donors’ intentions to donate blood with a floating number between 0 and 1. Performance of the prediction models was assessed by the Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score in the full dataset, and by the accuracy in the four sub-datasets. The developed models were applied to prospective validations of recruiting experienced blood donors during two COVID-19 pandemics, while the routine method was used as a control. Overall, a total of 95,476 recruitments via SMS and their donation results were enrolled in our modelling study. The strongest predictor features for the donation of experienced donors were blood donation interval, age, and donation frequency. Among the seven baseline models, the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Support vector machine models (SVM) achieved the best performance: mean (95%CI) with the highest AUC: 0.809 (0.806–0.811), accuracy: 0.815 (0.812–0.818), precision: 0.840 (0.835–0.845), and F1 score of XGBoost: 0.843 (0.840–0.845) and recall of SVM: 0.991 (0.988–0.994). The hit rate of the XGBoost model alone and the combined XGBoost and SVM models were 1.25 and 1.80 times higher than that of the conventional method as a control in 2 recruitments respectively, and the hit rate of the high willingness to donate group was 1.96 times higher than that of the low willingness to donate group. Our results suggested that the machine learning models could predict and determine the experienced donors with a strong willingness to donate blood by a ranking score based on personalized donation data and demographical details, significantly improve the recruitment rate of blood donors and help blood agencies to maintain the blood supply in emergencies.","Overall, our research provided a positive answer to the question of whether the donors’ intention to donate blood could be predicted from their donation records and developed 7 SMS recruitment models based on machine learning algorithms, which could predict whether an experienced donor was willing to donate blood, and the level of his willingness by a ranking score based on personalized donation data and demographical details. To our knowledge, this was the first prospective study on blood donor recruitment using a comprehensive scoring method based on machine learning, which predicted and ranked the personalized motivation of blood donors. The results of this study contributed to improving our understanding of what features were most important for donation and helping blood agencies to predict potential blood donors, make personalized recruitment plans to meet the patient’s needs, and improve recruitment efficacy with precision tactics to maintain the blood supply in emergencies.","Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Proteomic signatures for identification of impaired glucose tolerance,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-02055-z,10 Nov 2022,"The implementation of recommendations for type 2 diabetes (T2D) screening and diagnosis focuses on the measurement of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and fasting glucose. This approach leaves a large number of individuals with isolated impaired glucose tolerance (iIGT), who are only detectable through oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs), at risk of diabetes and its severe complications. We applied machine learning to the proteomic profiles of a single fasted sample from 11,546 participants of the Fenland study to test discrimination of iIGT defined using the gold-standard OGTTs. We observed significantly improved discriminative performance by adding only three proteins (RTN4R, CBPM and GHR) to the best clinical model (AUROC = 0.80 (95% confidence interval: 0.79–0.86), P = 0.004), which we validated in an external cohort. Increased plasma levels of these candidate proteins were associated with an increased risk for future T2D in an independent cohort and were also increased in individuals genetically susceptible to impaired glucose homeostasis and T2D. Assessment of a limited number of proteins can identify individuals likely to be missed by current diagnostic strategies and at high risk of T2D and its complications.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Prediction of the disease course in Friedreich ataxia,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-23666-z,10 Nov 2022,"We explored whether disease severity of Friedreich ataxia can be predicted using data from clinical examinations. From the database of the European Friedreich Ataxia Consortium for Translational Studies (EFACTS) data from up to five examinations of 602 patients with genetically confirmed FRDA was included. Clinical instruments and important symptoms of FRDA were identified as targets for prediction, while variables such as genetics, age of disease onset and first symptom of the disease were used as predictors. We used modelling techniques including generalised linear models, support-vector-machines and decision trees. The scale for rating and assessment of ataxia (SARA) and the activities of daily living (ADL) could be predicted with predictive errors quantified by root-mean-squared-errors (RMSE) of 6.49 and 5.83, respectively. Also, we were able to achieve reasonable performance for loss of ambulation (ROC-AUC score of 0.83). However, predictions for the SCA functional assessment (SCAFI) and presence of cardiological symptoms were difficult. In conclusion, we demonstrate that some clinical features of FRDA can be predicted with reasonable error; being a first step towards future clinical applications of predictive modelling. In contrast, targets where predictions were difficult raise the question whether there are yet unknown variables driving the clinical phenotype of FRDA.","In conclusion, in this paper we demonstrated that certain clinical instruments and features relevant for FRDA can be predicted to an extent that allows for an informed estimate about a patient’s disease severity. However, parts of the clinical phenotype of FRDA are still not well understood and this is reflected in subpar predictive performance when attempting to establish predictive modelling for these clinical features. This work can be seen as a promising first step towards a more individualised medicine in FRDA. Much more work, both on optimising modelling for the most promising targets, as well as on the understanding of FRDA as a whole is necessary.","Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Here, we took advantage of the temporal precision offered by trauma as a common cause of critical illness to identify the dynamic patterns in the circulating lipidome in critically ill humans. The major findings include an early loss of all classes of circulating lipids followed by a delayed and selective lipogenesis in patients destined to remain critically ill. The previously reported survival benefit of early thawed plasma administration was associated with preserved lipid levels that related to favorable changes in coagulation and inflammation biomarkers in causal modelling.

Multi-kingdom gut microbiota analyses define COVID-19 severity and post-acute COVID-19 syndrome,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-34535-8,10 Nov 2022,"Our knowledge of the role of the gut microbiome in acute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and post-acute COVID-19 is rapidly increasing, whereas little is known regarding the contribution of multi-kingdom microbiota and host-microbial interactions to COVID-19 severity and consequences. Herein, we perform an integrated analysis using 296 fecal metagenomes, 79 fecal metabolomics, viral load in 1378 respiratory tract samples, and clinical features of 133 COVID-19 patients prospectively followed for up to 6 months. Metagenomic-based clustering identifies two robust ecological clusters (hereafter referred to as Clusters 1 and 2), of which Cluster 1 is significantly associated with severe COVID-19 and the development of post-acute COVID-19 syndrome. Significant differences between clusters could be explained by both multi-kingdom ecological drivers (bacteria, fungi, and viruses) and host factors with a good predictive value and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.98. A model combining host and microbial factors could predict the duration of respiratory viral shedding with 82.1% accuracy (error ± 3 days). These results highlight the potential utility of host phenotype and multi-kingdom microbiota profiling as a prognostic tool for patients with COVID-19.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Establishment of a model for predicting the outcome of induced labor in full-term pregnancy based on machine learning algorithm,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-21954-2,09 Nov 2022,"To evaluate and establish a prediction model of the outcome of induced labor based on machine learning algorithm. This was a cross-sectional design. The subjects were divided into primipara and multipara, and the risk factors for the outcomes of induced labor were assessed by multifactor logistic regression analysis. The outcome model of labor induced with oxytocin (OT) was constructed based on the four machine learning algorithms, including AdaBoost, logistic regression, naive Bayes classifier, and support vector machine. Factors, such as accuracy, recall, precision, F1 value, and receiver operating characteristic curve, were used to evaluate the prediction performance of the model, and the clinical application of the model was verified. A total of 907 participants were included in this study. Logistic regression algorithm obtained better results in both primipara and multipara groups compared to the other three models. The accuracy of the model for the prediction of “successful induction of labor” was 94.24% and 96.55%, and that of “failed induction of labor” was 65.00% and 66.67% in the primipara and the multipara groups, respectively. This study established a prediction model of OT-induced labor based on the Logistic regression algorithm, with rapid response, high accuracy, and strong extrapolation, which was critical for obstetric clinical nursing.",Conclusions not available,Traditional ML,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Deep learning-based framework for slide-based histopathological image analysis,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-23166-0,09 Nov 2022,"Digital pathology coupled with advanced machine learning (e.g., deep learning) has been changing the paradigm of whole-slide histopathological images (WSIs) analysis. Major applications in digital pathology using machine learning include automatic cancer classification, survival analysis, and subtyping from pathological images. While most pathological image analyses are based on patch-wise processing due to the extremely large size of histopathology images, there are several applications that predict a single clinical outcome or perform pathological diagnosis per slide (e.g., cancer classification, survival analysis). However, current slide-based analyses are task-dependent, and a general framework of slide-based analysis in WSI has been seldom investigated. We propose a novel slide-based histopathology analysis framework that creates a WSI representation map, called HipoMap, that can be applied to any slide-based problems, coupled with convolutional neural networks. HipoMap converts a WSI of various shapes and sizes to structured image-type representation. Our proposed HipoMap outperformed existing methods in intensive experiments with various settings and datasets. HipoMap showed the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.96±0.026 (5% improved) in the experiments for lung cancer classification, and c-index of 0.787±0.013 (3.5% improved) and coefficient of determination (\(R^2\)) of 0.978±0.032 (24% improved) in survival analysis and survival prediction with TCGA lung cancer data respectively, as a general framework of slide-based analysis with a flexible capability. The results showed significant improvement comparing to the current state-of-the-art methods on each task. We further discussed experimental results of HipoMap as pathological viewpoints and verified the performance using publicly available TCGA datasets. A Python package is available at https://pypi.org/project/hipomap, and the package can be easily installed using Python PIP. The open-source codes in Python are available at: https://github.com/datax-lab/HipoMap.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Deep learning-based image analysis predicts PD-L1 status from H&E-stained histopathology images in breast cancer,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-34275-9,08 Nov 2022,"Programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) has been recently adopted for breast cancer as a predictive biomarker for immunotherapies. The cost, time, and variability of PD-L1 quantification by immunohistochemistry (IHC) are a challenge. In contrast, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) is a robust staining used routinely for cancer diagnosis. Here, we show that PD-L1 expression can be predicted from H&E-stained images by employing state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. With the help of two expert pathologists and a designed annotation software, we construct a dataset to assess the feasibility of PD-L1 prediction from H&E in breast cancer. In a cohort of 3,376 patients, our system predicts the PD-L1 status in a high area under the curve (AUC) of 0.91 – 0.93. Our system is validated on two external datasets, including an independent clinical trial cohort, showing consistent prediction performance. Furthermore, the proposed system predicts which cases are prone to pathologists miss-interpretation, showing it can serve as a decision support and quality assurance system in clinical practice.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Intellectually able adults with autism spectrum disorder show typical resting-state EEG activity,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-22597-z,08 Nov 2022,"There is broad interest in discovering quantifiable physiological biomarkers for psychiatric disorders to aid diagnostic assessment. However, finding biomarkers for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has proven particularly difficult, partly due to high heterogeneity. Here, we recorded five minutes eyes-closed rest electroencephalography (EEG) from 186 adults (51% with ASD and 49% without ASD) and investigated the potential of EEG biomarkers to classify ASD using three conventional machine learning models with two-layer cross-validation. Comprehensive characterization of spectral, temporal and spatial dimensions of source-modelled EEG resulted in 3443 biomarkers per recording. We found no significant group-mean or group-variance differences for any of the EEG features. Interestingly, we obtained validation accuracies above 80%; however, the best machine learning model merely distinguished ASD from the non-autistic comparison group with a mean balanced test accuracy of 56% on the entirely unseen test set. The large drop in model performance between validation and testing, stress the importance of rigorous model evaluation, and further highlights the high heterogeneity in ASD. Overall, the lack of significant differences and weak classification indicates that, at the group level, intellectually able adults with ASD show remarkably typical resting-state EEG.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Using machine-learning strategies to solve psychometric problems,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-23678-9,07 Nov 2022,"Validating scales for clinical use is a common procedure in medicine and psychology. Through the application of computational methods, we present a new strategy for estimating construct validity and criterion validity. XGBoost, Random Forest and Support-Vector machine learning algorithms were employed in order to make predictions based on the pattern of participants’ responses by systematically controlling computational experiments with artificial experiments whose results are guaranteed. According to these findings, these approaches are capable of achieving construct and criterion validity and therefore could provide an additional layer of evidence to traditional validation approaches. In particular, this study examined the extent to which measured items are inferable by theoretically related items, as well as the extent to which the information carried by a given construct can be translated into other theoretically compatible normative scales based on other constructs (thereby providing information about construct validity); as well as the replicability of clinical decision rules on several partitions (thereby providing information about criterion validity).",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Forecasting individual progression trajectories in Huntington disease enables more powered clinical trials,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-18848-8,07 Nov 2022,"Variability in neurodegenerative disease progression poses great challenges for the evaluation of potential treatments. Identifying the persons who will experience significant progression in the short term is key for the implementation of trials with smaller sample sizes. We apply here disease course mapping to forecast biomarker progression for individual carriers of the pathological CAG repeat expansions responsible for Huntington disease. We used data from two longitudinal studies (TRACK-HD and TRACK-ON) to synchronize temporal progression of 15 clinical and imaging biomarkers from 290 participants with Huntington disease. We used then the resulting HD COURSE MAP to forecast clinical endpoints from the baseline data of 11,510 participants from ENROLL-HD, an external validation cohort. We used such forecasts to select participants at risk for progression and compute the power of trials for such an enriched population. HD COURSE MAP forecasts biomarkers 5 years after the baseline measures with a maximum mean absolute error of 10 points for the total motor score and 2.15 for the total functional capacity. This allowed reducing sample sizes in trial up to 50% including participants with a higher risk for progression ensuring a more homogeneous group of participants.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
A data driven machine learning approach to differentiate between autism spectrum disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder based on the best-practice diagnostic instruments for autism,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-21719-x,05 Nov 2022,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are two frequently co-occurring neurodevelopmental conditions that share certain symptomatology, including social difficulties. This presents practitioners with challenging (differential) diagnostic considerations, particularly in clinically more complex cases with co-occurring ASD and ADHD. Therefore, the primary aim of the current study was to apply a data-driven machine learning approach (support vector machine) to determine whether and which items from the best-practice clinical instruments for diagnosing ASD (ADOS, ADI-R) would best differentiate between four groups of individuals referred to specialized ASD clinics (i.e., ASD, ADHD, ASD + ADHD, ND = no diagnosis). We found that a subset of five features from both ADOS (clinical observation) and ADI-R (parental interview) reliably differentiated between ASD groups (ASD & ASD + ADHD) and non-ASD groups (ADHD & ND), and these features corresponded to the social-communication but also restrictive and repetitive behavior domains. In conclusion, the results of the current study support the idea that detecting ASD in individuals with suspected signs of the diagnosis, including those with co-occurring ADHD, is possible with considerably fewer items relative to the original ADOS/2 and ADI-R algorithms (i.e., 92% item reduction) while preserving relatively high diagnostic accuracy. Clinical implications and study limitations are discussed.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Distributed lag inspired machine learning for predicting vaccine-induced changes in COVID-19 hospitalization and intensive care unit admission,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-21969-9,05 Nov 2022,"Distributed lags play important roles in explaining the short-run dynamic and long-run cumulative effects of features on a response variable. Unlike the usual lag length selection, important lags with significant weights are  selected in a distributed lag model (DLM). Inspired by the importance of distributed lags, this research focuses on the construction of distributed lag inspired machine learning (DLIML) for predicting vaccine-induced changes in COVID-19 hospitalization and intensive care unit (ICU) admission rates. Importance of a lagged feature in DLM is examined by hypothesis testing and a subset of important features are selected by evaluating an information criterion. Akin to the DLM, we demonstrate the selection of distributed lags in machine learning by evaluating importance scores and objective functions. Finally, we apply the DLIML with supervised learning for forecasting daily changes in COVID-19 hospitalization and ICU admission rates in United Kingdom (UK) and United States of America (USA). A sharp decline in hospitalization and ICU admission rates are observed when around 40% people are vaccinated. For one percent more vaccination, daily changes in hospitalization and ICU admission rates are expected to reduce by 4.05 and 0.74 per million after 14 days in UK, and 5.98 and 1.04 per million after 20 days in USA, respectively. Long-run cumulative effects in the DLM demonstrate that the daily changes in hospitalization and ICU admission rates are expected to jitter around the zero line in a long-run. Application of the DLIML selects fewer lagged features but provides qualitatively better forecasting outcome for data-driven healthcare service planning.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

This study aimed to create a deep learning model for automated bolus segmentation on VFG images of patients with healthy swallowing and dysphagia using the artificial intelligence deep learning segmentation method, and to assess the performance of the method. VFG images of 72 swallowing of 12 patients were continuously converted into 15 static images per second. In total, 3910 images were arbitrarily assigned to the training, validation, test 1, and test 2 datasets. In the training and validation datasets, images of colored bolus areas were prepared, along with original images. Using a U-Net neural network, a trained model was created after 500 epochs of training. The test datasets were applied to the trained model, and the performances of automatic segmentation (Jaccard index, Sørensen–Dice coefficient, and sensitivity) were calculated. All performance values for the segmentation of the test 1 and 2 datasets were high, exceeding 0.9. Using an artificial intelligence deep learning segmentation method, we automatically segmented the bolus areas on VFG images; our method exhibited high performance.

DeepPDT-Net: predicting the outcome of photodynamic therapy for chronic central serous chorioretinopathy using two-stage multimodal transfer learning,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-22984-6,04 Nov 2022,"Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC), characterized by serous detachment of the macular retina, can cause permanent vision loss in the chronic course. Chronic CSC is generally treated with photodynamic therapy (PDT), which is costly and quite invasive, and the results are unpredictable. In a retrospective case–control study design, we developed a two-stage deep learning model to predict 1-year outcome of PDT using initial multimodal clinical data. The training dataset included 166 eyes with chronic CSC and an additional learning dataset containing 745 healthy control eyes. A pre-trained ResNet50-based convolutional neural network was first trained with normal fundus photographs (FPs) to detect CSC and then adapted to predict CSC treatability through transfer learning. The domain-specific ResNet50 successfully predicted treatable and refractory CSC (accuracy, 83.9%). Then other multimodal clinical data were integrated with the FP deep features using XGBoost.The final combined model (DeepPDT-Net) outperformed the domain-specific ResNet50 (accuracy, 88.0%). The FP deep features had the greatest impact on DeepPDT-Net performance, followed by central foveal thickness and age. In conclusion, DeepPDT-Net could solve the PDT outcome prediction task challenging even to retinal specialists. This two-stage strategy, adopting transfer learning and concatenating multimodal data, can overcome the clinical prediction obstacles arising from insufficient datasets.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Representational ethical model calibration,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-022-00716-4,04 Nov 2022,"Equity is widely held to be fundamental to the ethics of healthcare. In the context of clinical decision-making, it rests on the comparative fidelity of the intelligence – evidence-based or intuitive – guiding the management of each individual patient. Though brought to recent attention by the individuating power of contemporary machine learning, such epistemic equity arises in the context of any decision guidance, whether traditional or innovative. Yet no general framework for its quantification, let alone assurance, currently exists. Here we formulate epistemic equity in terms of model fidelity evaluated over learnt multidimensional representations of identity crafted to maximise the captured diversity of the population, introducing a comprehensive framework for Representational Ethical Model Calibration. We demonstrate the use of the framework on large-scale multimodal data from UK Biobank to derive diverse representations of the population, quantify model performance, and institute responsive remediation. We offer our approach as a principled solution to quantifying and assuring epistemic equity in healthcare, with applications across the research, clinical, and regulatory domains.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Data-driven comorbidity analysis of 100 common disorders reveals patient subgroups with differing mortality risks and laboratory correlates,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-23090-3,02 Nov 2022,"The populational heterogeneity of a disease, in part due to comorbidity, poses several complexities. Individual comorbidity profiles, on the other hand, contain useful information to refine phenotyping, prognostication, and risk assessment, and they provide clues to underlying biology. Nevertheless, the spectrum and the implications of the diagnosis profiles remain largely uncharted. Here we mapped comorbidity patterns in 100 common diseases using 4-year retrospective data from 526,779 patients and developed an online tool to visualize the results. Our analysis exposed disease-specific patient subgroups with distinctive diagnosis patterns, survival functions, and laboratory correlates. Computational modeling and real-world data shed light on the structure, variation, and relevance of populational comorbidity patterns, paving the way for improved diagnostics, risk assessment, and individualization of care. Variation in outcomes and biological correlates of a disease emphasizes the importance of evaluating the generalizability of current treatment strategies, as well as considering the limitations that selective inclusion criteria pose on clinical trials.",Conclusions not available,Gen AI,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Prediction of early-stage melanoma recurrence using clinical and histopathologic features,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41698-022-00321-4,31 Oct 2022,"Prognostic analysis for early-stage (stage I/II) melanomas is of paramount importance for customized surveillance and treatment plans. Since immune checkpoint inhibitors have recently been approved for stage IIB and IIC melanomas, prognostic tools to identify patients at high risk of recurrence have become even more critical. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of machine-learning algorithms in predicting melanoma recurrence using clinical and histopathologic features from Electronic Health Records (EHRs). We collected 1720 early-stage melanomas: 1172 from the Mass General Brigham healthcare system (MGB) and 548 from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI). We extracted 36 clinicopathologic features and used them to predict the recurrence risk with supervised machine-learning algorithms. Models were evaluated internally and externally: (1) five-fold cross-validation of the MGB cohort; (2) the MGB cohort for training and the DFCI cohort for testing independently. In the internal and external validations, respectively, we achieved a recurrence classification performance of AUC: 0.845 and 0.812, and a time-to-event prediction performance of time-dependent AUC: 0.853 and 0.820. Breslow tumor thickness and mitotic rate were identified as the most predictive features. Our results suggest that machine-learning algorithms can extract predictive signals from clinicopathologic features for early-stage melanoma recurrence prediction, which will enable the identification of patients that may benefit from adjuvant immunotherapy.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Artificial intelligence used to diagnose osteoporosis from risk factors in clinical data and proposing sports protocols,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-23184-y,31 Oct 2022,"Osteoporosis (OP) is characterized by diminished bone mass and deteriorating bone structure that increases the chance of fractures in the spine, hips, and wrists. In this paper, a novel data processing method of artificial intelligence (AI) is used for evaluating, predicting, and classifying OP risk factors in clinical data of men and women separately. Additionally, artificial intelligence was used to suggest the most appropriate sports programs for treatment. Data was obtained from dual-energy x-ray absorption scanning center of Ayatollah Kashani, Milad, and Khatam al-Anbia hospitals in Tehran, Iran. The subjects included 1224 men and women. Models were developed using decision tree, random forest (RF), k-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, gradient boosting (GB), Extra trees, Ada Boost (AB), and artificial neural network multilayer perceptron analysis to predict osteoporosis and to recommend sports programs. Data was divided into training (80%) and test dataset (20%). The results were obtained on a 20% test dataset. Area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was used to compare the performance of the models. To predict healthy individuals, osteopenia and osteoporosis, the FR algorithm with AUROC 0.91 performed best in men and the GB algorithm with AUROC 0.95 performed best in women compared to other classification algorithms. Prediction of RF algorithm in women and men with AUROC 0.96 and 0.99, respectively, showed the highest performance in diagnosing the type of exercise for healthy individuals and those with osteopenia and OP. Eight AI algorithms were developed and compared to accurately predict osteoporosis risk factors and classify individuals into three categories: healthy, osteopenia, and OP. In addition, the AI algorithms were developed to recommend the most appropriate sports programs as part of treatment. Applying the AI algorithms in a clinical setting could help primary care providers classify patients with osteoporosis and improve treatment by recommending appropriate exercise programs.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Here we presented a simplified risk-tool based on minimal parameters and chest X-ray (CXR) image data that predicts the survival of adult SARS-CoV-2 positive patients at hospital admission. We analysed the NCCID database of patient blood variables and CXR images from 19 hospitals across the UK using multivariable logistic regression. The initial dataset was non-randomly split between development and internal validation dataset with 1434 and 310 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, respectively. External validation of the final model was conducted on 741 Accident and Emergency (A&E) admissions with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection from a separate NHS Trust. The LUCAS mortality score included five strongest predictors (Lymphocyte count, Urea, C-reactive protein, Age, Sex), which are available at any point of care with rapid turnaround of results. Our simple multivariable logistic model showed high discrimination for fatal outcome with the area under the receiving operating characteristics curve (AUC-ROC) in development cohort 0.765 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.738–0.790), in internal validation cohort 0.744 (CI: 0.673–0.808), and in external validation cohort 0.752 (CI: 0.713–0.787).

Genetically-informed prediction of short-term Parkinson’s disease progression,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41531-022-00412-w,28 Oct 2022,"Parkinson’s disease (PD) treatments modify disease symptoms but have not been shown to slow progression, characterized by gradual and varied motor and non-motor changes overtime. Variation in PD progression hampers clinical research, resulting in long and expensive clinical trials prone to failure. Development of models for short-term PD progression prediction could be useful for shortening the time required to detect disease-modifying drug effects in clinical studies. PD progressors were defined by an increase in MDS-UPDRS scores at 12-, 24-, and 36-months post-baseline. Using only baseline features, PD progression was separately predicted across all timepoints and MDS-UPDRS subparts in independent, optimized, XGBoost models. These predictions plus baseline features were combined into a meta-predictor for 12-month MDS UPDRS Total progression. Data from the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) were used for training with independent testing on the Parkinson’s Disease Biomarkers Program (PDBP) cohort. 12-month PD total progression was predicted with an F-measure 0.77, ROC AUC of 0.77, and PR AUC of 0.76 when tested on a hold-out PPMI set. When tested on PDBP we achieve a F-measure 0.75, ROC AUC of 0.74, and PR AUC of 0.73. Exclusion of genetic predictors led to the greatest loss in predictive accuracy; ROC AUC of 0.66, PR AUC of 0.66–0.68 for both PPMI and PDBP testing. Short-term PD progression can be predicted with a combination of survey-based, neuroimaging, physician examination, and genetic predictors.

"Polygenic Health Index, General Health, and Pleiotropy: Sibling Analysis and Disease Risk Reduction",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-22637-8,28 Oct 2022,"We construct a polygenic health index as a weighted sum of polygenic risk scores for 20 major disease conditions, including, e.g., coronary artery disease, type 1 and 2 diabetes, schizophrenia, etc. Individual weights are determined by population-level estimates of impact on life expectancy. We validate this index in odds ratios and selection experiments using unrelated individuals and siblings (pairs and trios) from the UK Biobank. Individuals with higher index scores have decreased disease risk across almost all 20 diseases (no significant risk increases), and longer calculated life expectancy. When estimated Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) are used as the performance metric, the gain from selection among ten individuals (highest index score vs average) is found to be roughly 4 DALYs. We find no statistical evidence for antagonistic trade-offs in risk reduction across these diseases. Correlations between genetic disease risks are found to be mostly positive and generally mild. These results have important implications for public health and also for fundamental issues such as pleiotropy and genetic architecture of human disease conditions.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

We developed and validated machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict DAA treatment failure. Using the HCV-TARGET registry of adults who initiated all-oral DAA treatment, we developed elastic net (EN), random forest (RF), gradient boosting machine (GBM), and feedforward neural network (FNN) ML algorithms. Model performances were compared with multivariable logistic regression (MLR) by assessing C statistics and other prediction evaluation metrics. Among 6525 HCV-infected adults, 308 patients (4.7%) experienced DAA treatment failure. ML models performed similarly in predicting DAA treatment failure (C statistic [95% CI]: EN, 0.74 [0.69–0.79]; RF, 0.74 [0.69–0.80]; GBM, 0.72 [0.67–0.78]; FNN, 0.75 [0.70–0.80]), and all 4 outperformed MLR (C statistic [95% CI]: 0.51 [0.46–0.57]), and EN used the fewest predictors (n = 27). With Youden index, the EN had 58.4% sensitivity and 77.8% specificity, and nine patients were needed to evaluate to identify 1 DAA treatment failure. Over 60% treatment failure were classified in top three risk decile subgroups. EN-identified predictors included male sex, treatment < 8 weeks, treatment discontinuation due to adverse events, albumin level < 3.5 g/dL, total bilirubin level > 1.2 g/dL, advanced liver disease, and use of tobacco, alcohol, or vitamins.

"Synthesis and preliminary biological evaluation of gabactyzine, a benactyzine-GABA mutual prodrug, as an organophosphate antidote",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-23141-9,27 Oct 2022,"Organophosphates (OPs) are inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase and have deleterious effects on the central nervous system. Clinical manifestations of OP poisoning include convulsions, which represent an underlying toxic neuro-pathological process, leading to permanent neuronal damage. This neurotoxicity is mediated through the cholinergic, GABAergic and glutamatergic (NMDA) systems. Pharmacological interventions in OP poisoning are designed to mitigate these specific neuro-pathological pathways, using anticholinergic drugs and GABAergic agents. Benactyzine is a combined anticholinergic, anti-NMDA compound. Based on previous development of novel GABA derivatives (such as prodrugs based on perphenazine for the treatment of schizophrenia and nortriptyline against neuropathic pain), we describe the synthesis and preliminary testing of a mutual prodrug ester of benactyzine and GABA. It is assumed that once the ester crosses the blood–brain-barrier it will undergo hydrolysis, releasing benactyzine and GABA, which are expected to act synergistically. The combined release of both compounds in the brain offers several advantages over the current OP poisoning treatment protocol: improved efficacy and safety profile (where the inhibitory properties of GABA are expected to counteract the anticholinergic cognitive adverse effects of benactyzine) and enhanced chemical stability compared to benactyzine alone. We present here preliminary results of animal studies, showing promising results with early gabactyzine administration.",Conclusions not available,Gen AI,Attack Types: poisoning; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Simulation of a machine learning enabled learning health system for risk prediction using synthetic patient data,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-23011-4,26 Oct 2022,"When enabled by machine learning (ML), Learning Health Systems (LHS) hold promise for improving the effectiveness of healthcare delivery to patients. One major barrier to LHS research and development is the lack of access to EHR patient data. To overcome this challenge, this study demonstrated the feasibility of developing a simulated ML-enabled LHS using synthetic patient data. The ML-enabled LHS was initialized using a dataset of 30,000 synthetic Synthea patients and a risk prediction XGBoost base model for lung cancer. 4 additional datasets of 30,000 patients were generated and added to the previous updated dataset sequentially to simulate addition of new patients, resulting in datasets of 60,000, 90,000, 120,000 and 150,000 patients. New XGBoost models were built in each instance, and performance improved with data size increase, attaining 0.936 recall and 0.962 AUC (area under curve) in the 150,000 patients dataset. The effectiveness of the new ML-enabled LHS process was verified by implementing XGBoost models for stroke risk prediction on the same Synthea patient populations. By making the ML code and synthetic patient data publicly available for testing and training, this first synthetic LHS process paves the way for more researchers to start developing LHS with real patient data.","In conclusion, this simulation study created the first synthetic LHS, i.e. ML-enabled learning health system of synthetic patients. It has demonstrated the effectiveness of the new LHS process, in which a risk prediction LHS can be created by building a XGBoost base model for any given target disease such as lung cancer or stroke from existing EHR data. With its intrinsically data-centric approach, the LHS can continuously learn from new patient data over time to improve the ML model performance, and ultimately achieve high recall and precision (> 95%) for disease risk prediction. The resulting synthetic data ML model cannot be used in real care delivery, so it is the LHS process that can be followed to build disease risk prediction LHS with real patient data. Finally, because real data is different from synthetic data, real data ML models can be optimized further by hyperparameter tuning.","Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Artificial intelligence-based methods for fusion of electronic health records and imaging data,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-22514-4,26 Oct 2022,"Healthcare data are inherently multimodal, including electronic health records (EHR), medical images, and multi-omics data. Combining these multimodal data sources contributes to a better understanding of human health and provides optimal personalized healthcare. The most important question when using multimodal data is how to fuse them—a field of growing interest among researchers. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, particularly machine learning (ML), enable the fusion of these different data modalities to provide multimodal insights. To this end, in this scoping review, we focus on synthesizing and analyzing the literature that uses AI techniques to fuse multimodal medical data for different clinical applications. More specifically, we focus on studies that only fused EHR with medical imaging data to develop various AI methods for clinical applications. We present a comprehensive analysis of the various fusion strategies, the diseases and clinical outcomes for which multimodal fusion was used, the ML algorithms used to perform multimodal fusion for each clinical application, and the available multimodal medical datasets. We followed the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines. We searched Embase, PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar to retrieve relevant studies. After pre-processing and screening, we extracted data from 34 studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. We found that studies fusing imaging data with EHR are increasing and doubling from 2020 to 2021. In our analysis, a typical workflow was observed: feeding raw data, fusing different data modalities by applying conventional machine learning (ML) or deep learning (DL) algorithms, and finally, evaluating the multimodal fusion through clinical outcome predictions. Specifically, early fusion was the most used technique in most applications for multimodal learning (22 out of 34 studies). We found that multimodality fusion models outperformed traditional single-modality models for the same task. Disease diagnosis and prediction were the most common clinical outcomes (reported in 20 and 10 studies, respectively) from a clinical outcome perspective. Neurological disorders were the dominant category (16 studies). From an AI perspective, conventional ML models were the most used (19 studies), followed by DL models (16 studies). Multimodal data used in the included studies were mostly from private repositories (21 studies). Through this scoping review, we offer new insights for researchers interested in knowing the current state of knowledge within this research field.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Multilayer perceptron-based prediction of stroke mimics in prehospital triage,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-22919-1,26 Oct 2022,"The identification of stroke mimics (SMs) in patients with stroke could lead to delayed diagnosis and waste of medical resources. Multilayer perceptron (MLP) was proved to be an accurate tool for clinical applications. However, MLP haven’t been applied in patients with suspected stroke onset within 24 h. Here, we aimed to develop a MLP model to predict SM in patients. We retrospectively reviewed the data of patients with a prehospital diagnosis of suspected stroke between July 2017 and June 2021. SMs were confirmed during hospitalization. We included demographic information, clinical manifestations, medical history, and systolic and diastolic pressure on admission. First, the cohort was randomly divided into a training set (70%) and an external testing set (30%). Then, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method was used in feature selection and an MLP model was trained based on the selected items. Then, we evaluated the performance of the model using the ten-fold cross validation method. Finally, we used the external testing set to compare the MLP model with FABS scoring system (FABS) and TeleStroke Mimic Score (TM-Score) using a receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve. In total, 402 patients were included. Of these, 82 (20.5%) were classified as SMs. During the ten-fold cross validation, the mean area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 10 training sets and 10 validation sets were 0.92 and 0.87, respectively. In the external testing set, the AUC of the MLP model was significantly higher than that of the FABS (0.855 vs. 0.715, P = 0.038) and TM-Score (0.855 vs. 0.646, P = 0.006). The MLP model had significantly better performance in predicting SMs than FABS and TM-Score.","The restricted time window requires a more accurate and intelligent classifier during prehospital triage. The MLP model is an effective tool for differentiating stroke and SM patients, and performs better than other SM probability scales for prehospital stroke recognition. Further prospective validations are needed for MLP model in a larger sample-size data.","Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Predicting radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula success with machine learning,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-022-00710-w,25 Oct 2022,"After creation of a new arteriovenous fistula (AVF), assessment of readiness for use is an important clinical task. Accurate prediction of successful use is challenging, and augmentation of the physical exam with ultrasound has become routine. Herein, we propose a point-of-care tool based on machine learning to enhance prediction of successful unassisted radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula (AVF) use. Our analysis includes pooled patient-level data from 704 patients undergoing new radiocephalic AVF creation, eligible for hemodialysis, and enrolled in the 2014–2019 international multicenter PATENCY-1 or PATENCY-2 randomized controlled trials. The primary outcome being predicted is successful unassisted AVF use within 1-year, defined as 2-needle cannulation for hemodialysis for ≥90 days without preceding intervention. Logistic, penalized logistic (lasso and elastic net), decision tree, random forest, and boosted tree classification models were built with a training, tuning, and testing paradigm using a combination of baseline clinical characteristics and 4–6 week ultrasound parameters. Performance assessment includes receiver operating characteristic curves, precision-recall curves, calibration plots, and decision curves. All modeling approaches except the decision tree have similar discrimination performance and comparable net-benefit (area under the ROC curve 0.78–0.81, accuracy 69.1–73.6%). Model performance is superior to Kidney Disease Outcome Quality Initiative and University of Alabama at Birmingham ultrasound threshold criteria. The lasso model is presented as the final model due to its parsimony, retaining only 3 covariates: larger outflow vein diameter, higher flow volume, and absence of >50% luminal stenosis. A point-of-care online calculator is deployed to facilitate AVF assessment in the clinic.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Survival analysis of localized prostate cancer with deep learning,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-22118-y,24 Oct 2022,"In recent years, data-driven, deep-learning-based models have shown great promise in medical risk prediction. By utilizing the large-scale Electronic Health Record data found in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States, we have developed an automated, personalized risk prediction model to support the clinical decision-making process for localized prostate cancer patients. This method combines the representative power of deep learning and the analytical interpretability of parametric regression models and can implement both time-dependent and static input data. To collect a comprehensive evaluation of model performances, we calculate time-dependent C-statistics \(C_{\text {td}}\) over 2-, 5-, and 10-year time horizons using either a composite outcome or prostate cancer mortality as the target event. The composite outcome combines the Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) test, metastasis, and prostate cancer mortality. Our longitudinal model Recurrent Deep Survival Machine (RDSM) achieved \(C_{\text {td}}\) 0.85 (0.83), 0.80 (0.83), and 0.76 (0.81), while the cross-sectional model Deep Survival Machine (DSM) attained \(C_{\text {td}}\) 0.85 (0.82), 0.80 (0.82), and 0.76 (0.79) for the 2-, 5-, and 10-year composite (mortality) outcomes, respectively. In addition to estimating the survival probability, our method can quantify the uncertainty associated with the prediction. The uncertainty scores show a consistent correlation with the prediction accuracy. We find PSA and prostate cancer stage information are the most important indicators in risk prediction. Our work demonstrates the utility of the data-driven machine learning model in prostate cancer risk prediction, which can play a critical role in the clinical decision system.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Mouse tissue glycome atlas 2022 highlights inter-organ variation in major N-glycan profiles,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-21758-4,24 Oct 2022,"This study presents “mouse tissue glycome atlas” representing the profiles of major N-glycans of mouse glycoproteins that may define their essential functions in the surface glycocalyx of mouse organs/tissues and serum-derived extracellular vesicles (exosomes). Cell surface glycocalyx composed of a variety of N-glycans attached covalently to the membrane proteins, notably characteristic “N-glycosylation patterns” of the glycocalyx, plays a critical role for the regulation of cell differentiation, cell adhesion, homeostatic immune response, and biodistribution of secreted exosomes. Given that the integrity of cell surface glycocalyx correlates significantly with maintenance of the cellular morphology and homeostatic immune functions, dynamic alterations of N-glycosylation patterns in the normal glycocalyx caused by cellular abnormalities may serve as highly sensitive and promising biomarkers. Although it is believed that inter-organs variations in N-glycosylation patterns exist, information of the glycan diversity in mouse organs/tissues remains to be elusive. Here we communicate for the first-time N-glycosylation patterns of 16 mouse organs/tissues, serum, and serum-derived exosomes of Slc:ddY mice using an established solid-phase glycoblotting platform for the rapid, easy, and high throughput MALDI-TOFMS-based quantitative glycomics. The present results elicited occurrence of the organ/tissue-characteristic N-glycosylation patterns that can be discriminated to each other. Basic machine learning analysis using this N-glycome dataset enabled classification between 16 mouse organs/tissues with the highest F1 score (69.7–100%) when neural network algorithm was used. A preliminary examination demonstrated that machine learning analysis of mouse lung N-glycome dataset by random forest algorithm allows for the discrimination of lungs among the different mouse strains such as the outbred mouse Slc:ddY, inbred mouse DBA/2Crslc, and systemic lupus erythematosus model mouse MRL-lpr/lpr with the highest F1 score (74.5–83.8%). Our results strongly implicate importance of “human organ/tissue glycome atlas” for understanding the crucial and diversified roles of glycocalyx determined by the organ/tissue-characteristic N-glycosylation patterns and the discovery research for N-glycome-based disease-specific biomarkers and therapeutic targets.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Feasibility of the optimal cerebral perfusion pressure value identification without a delay that is too long,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-22566-6,22 Oct 2022,"Optimal cerebral perfusion pressure (CPPopt)-targeted treatment of traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients requires 2–8 h multi-modal monitoring data accumulation to identify CPPopt value for individual patient. Minimizing the time required for monitoring data accumulation is needed to improve the efficacy of CPPopt-targeted therapy. A retrospective analysis of multimodal physiological monitoring data from 87 severe TBI patients was performed by separately representing cerebrovascular autoregulation (CA) indices in relation to CPP, arterial blood pressure (ABP), and intracranial pressure (ICP) to improve the existing CPPopt identification algorithms. Machine learning (ML)-based algorithms were developed for automatic identification of informative data segments that were used for reliable CPPopt, ABPopt, ICPopt and the lower/upper limits of CA (LLCA/ULCA) identification. The reference datasets of the informative data segments and, artifact-distorted segments, and the datasets of different clinical situations were used for training the ML-based algorithms, allowing us to choose the appropriate individualized CPP-, ABP- or ICP-guided management for 79% of the full monitoring time for the studied population. The developed ML-based algorithms allow us to recognize informative physiological ABP/ICP variations within 24 min intervals with an accuracy up to 79% (compared to the initial accuracy of 74%) and use these segments for timely optimal value identification or CA limits determination in CPP, ABP or ICP data.

A machine learning approach to explore predictors of graft detachment following posterior lamellar keratoplasty: a nationwide registry study,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-22223-y,21 Oct 2022,"Machine learning can be used to explore the complex multifactorial patterns underlying postsurgical graft detachment after endothelial corneal transplantation surgery and to evaluate the marginal effect of various practice pattern modulations. We included all posterior lamellar keratoplasty procedures recorded in the Dutch Cornea Transplant Registry from 2015 through 2018 and collected the center-specific practice patterns using a questionnaire. All available data regarding the donor, recipient, surgery, and practice pattern, were coded into 91 factors that might be associated with the occurrence of a graft detachment. In this research, we used three machine learning methods; a regularized logistic regression (lasso), classification tree analysis (CTA), and random forest classification (RFC), to select the most predictive subset of variables for graft detachment. A total of 3647 transplants were included in our analysis and the overall prevalence of graft detachment was 9.9%. In an independent test set the area under the curve for the lasso, CTA, and RFC was 0.70, 0.65, and 0.72, respectively. Identified risk factors included: a Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty procedure, prior graft failure, and the use of sulfur hexafluoride gas. Factors with a reduced risk included: performing combined procedures, using pre-cut donor tissue, and a pre-operative laser iridotomy. These results can help surgeons to review their practice patterns and generate hypotheses for empirical research regarding the origins of graft detachments.","Here, we report the use of three different machine learning models to explore factors that can predict the probability of graft detachment following posterior lamellar keratoplasty. The predictive power was similar between all three models and is considered to be acceptable (ranging from 0.65 to 0.72). Our identification of predictive factors can help surgeons make evidence-based changes of their practice patterns, provide insight in the marginal contribution to surgical safety of current practices, and can help generate hypotheses for empirical clinical research regarding the origins of graft detachments. Particularly, this study can function as a data-driven protocol standardization of future prospective studies regarding posterior lamellar keratoplasties.A major strength of this study is our access to an extensive, nationwide dataset and the inclusion of practice patterns in our analysis of a national cornea transplantation registry. The real-world data of the transplantation registry are represented with practically absent inclusion bias, owing to the obligatory and incentivized data-entry in the register. The assessment of both linear and non-linear relationships between a wide range of factors is unique and revealed the complex interactions between factors8,11,12,27,36. Moreover, the presented approach enables the evaluation of the numerous modulations of practice patterns in use and the relative impact of proposed key factors, particularly of value in the rapidly evolving field of surgery in which assessing these practice patterns independently in a clinical study would not be feasible.Despite these strengths several limitations warrant discussion. None of our three models explain all of the variance in our dataset, and not all factors that can affect graft detachment are registered in our dataset (e.g., patient’s behavior and compliance, unrecorded intraoperative events). Furthermore, the register lacks comprehensive contextual information and the completeness and correctness of the data in the registry could not be validated. This lack of contextual information is exemplified by our finding of unknown and/or missing observations in the model output; the interpretation of which is ambiguous and full of assumptions. We therefore chose to not report these outputs. With respect to the practice patterns, we cannot exclude response/recall bias regarding the replies to the questionnaire. Although the surgical protocols for DSEK and DMEK overlap to a large degree, they also differ in several respects. By aggregating the two procedures into a single database, procedure-specific predictive factors might not be identified. Certain predictive factors, such as aphakia, were relatively rare and therefore lack the necessary power to appear in the model output, whilst experts agree on the added risk of this particular condition. Therefore, the effect of certain variables cannot be estimated reliably. Finally, the retrospective nature of the study should be noted. Prospective validation of the results is essential to evaluate the usefulness of the models and possible applications in clinical practice.The effect of donor-related factors, recipient-related factors, surgery-related factors, and practice patterns on the prevalence of graft detachment is an ongoing topic of discussion. Many surgeons in the Netherlands are transitioning from DSEK to DMEK37, and our results indicate that DMEK is associated with an increased risk of graft detachment, consistent with previous studies4,5,6. This increased risk may be due in part to increased difficulty when handling the DMEK graft and/or the fact the DMEK graft edge is more prone to curling up, thus lifting the graft from the recipient’s stromal bed38,39. In addition, partial detachments are more common after DMEK, possibly increasing the rate of rebubbling of the graft compared to DSEK40. Alternatively, the increased risk associated with DMEK may partially be related to the surgeon’s learning curve. Indeed, from 2016 to 2018 the prevalence of graft detachment decreased more steeply for DMEK than for DSEK4. In our model, we attempted to correct for this learning curve by excluding the first 20 DMEK surgeries performed at each clinic, although the results in Table 1 suggest a shallower learning curve; thus, our model may have overestimated the effect of the DMEK procedure and DMEK specific factors.Our results show a diffuse pattern of donor age, recipient age, donor cause of death, and the interval between donor death and surgery. Regarding these factors, our analyses are inconclusive. Regarding preparation techniques, our results are consistent with previous studies that found no difference between pre-cut and surgeon-cut tissues13,15. Graft marking was associated with an increased risk of detachment in the Lasso model only. However, in the Netherlands graft marking is infrequently practiced, clouding the full assessment of the effect of this practice. Furthermore, and consistent with previous findings, our models indicate that patients who had one or more previously failed grafts had a higher risk of detachment36.We also found that several types of graft insertion devices were associated with an increased risk graft detachment; however, we consider the choice of insertion device a proxy for idiosyncratic surgeon factors too subtle to be captured in our register or questionnaire. We opted not to enter to individual surgeon or center as a model factor, as this study is not designed as an exercise in benchmarking. Notwithstanding, these expected between-surgeon differences might now be attributed to proxy parameters. The insertion tools themselves are known to increase the risk of endothelial damage, although no significant differences have been found between the various commercially available insertion devices8,20,21. Furthermore, we found that a graft diameter > 8.4 mm may be associated with a reduced risk of graft detachment. Several groups previously hypothesized that a larger graft may overlap with the retained Descemet membrane in the recipient, thus inhibiting graft attachment22,23. However, no effect of graft size compared to the descemetorhexis size was found. Both DMEK and DSEK are increasingly combined with other procedures such as cataract surgery. In none of our models a combination of procedures was associated with an increased risk risk of graft detachment. Combining these results with previous studies we can conclude that combining surgical procedures does not increase the risk of graft detachment12,25,26. Finally, two of the three models in our study found that pre-operative laser peripheral iridotomy was more protective than surgical peripheral iridectomy, although none of the models found that surgical peripheral iridectomy substantially increased the risk of detachment. This difference between laser iridotomy and surgical iridectomy may be due to the increased risk of intraoperative fibrin formation during surgical iridectomy41.Interestingly, we found that using air as the tamponade agent was not associated with an increased risk of graft detachment, while using SF6 gas appeared to increase the risk of graft detachment. This finding is in contrast with previous studies suggesting that the use of SF6 gas may reduce the risk of graft detachment32,42,43. This discrepancy may be explained in part by the recent transition of surgeons to using SF6 gas together with the concomitant transition to performing DMEK (with a subsequent increased risk of detachment in their learning curve). Nevertheless, we believe that the previously reported putative benefits associated with using SF6 gas might have been overestimated relative to all other factors and is exemplified by continued reports of relatively high rates of graft detachment5,6,12,40,44,45. After posterior lamellar keratoplasties, patients are instructed to remain in the supine position in order to maximize the beneficial effects of AC tamponade, and the length of time in this position can affect the risk of graft detachment. The results of our study indicate that strictly imposing a supine duration of at least 2 h reduced the risk of graft detachment. Similar results were also found if the patients were instructed to remain in the supine position for 48 h following surgery, consistent with the routine practice of most surgeons9,28.Lastly, several previously suggested risk and protective factors were not identified by our models. For example, we found no effect of increasing intraocular pressure above physiological limits for a certain time, consistent with previous studies suggesting that overpressuring of the eye after graft insertion has only a limited protective effect30,46,47. Similarly, we found no increased risk of complications either during or following surgery; however, this apparent lack of effect may have been due to the relatively low incidence of these events.In conclusion, we applied a supervised machine learning approach to a nationwide dataset and identified the most relevant factors for predicting graft detachment following posterior lamellar keratoplasties. Our analysis revealed that performing a DMEK procedure, the use of SF6 gas, and previous graft failure increased the risk of detachment, whereas performing a DSEK procedure, preoperative laser iridotomy, larger graft size, remaining strictly supine for at least 2 h, and a recommendation for staying in the supine position for 48 h reduced the risk of detachment. In contrast, performing a combined procedures and the use of pre-cut tissue had no effect on the risk of graft detachment, neither did overpressuring of the eye after graft-insertion. These results can help surgeons improve their practice patterns and can help researchers formulate new, testable hypotheses. Future studies should focus on improving the performance of machine learning approaches by including more detailed, contextual information. Importantly, these models’ “in silico” predictions should be tested in clinical practice.","Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Forecasting SARS-CoV-2 transmission and clinical risk at small spatial scales by the application of machine learning architectures to syndromic surveillance data,https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-022-00538-9,21 Oct 2022,"Timely and well-informed syndromic surveillance is essential for effective public health policy. The monitoring of traditional epidemiological indicators can be lagged and misleading, which hampers efforts to identify hotspot locations. The increasing predominance of digitalized healthcare-seeking behaviour necessitates that it is fully exploited for the public benefit of effective pandemic management. Using the highest-resolution spatial data for Google Trends relative search volumes, Google mobility, telecoms mobility, National Health Service Pathways calls and website testing journeys, we have developed a machine learning early indicator modelling approach of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and clinical risk at small geographic scales. We trained shallow learning algorithms as the baseline against a geospatial neural network architecture that we termed the spatio-integrated long short-term memory (SI-LSTM) algorithm. The SI-LSTM algorithm was able to—for the assessed temporal periods—accurately identify hotspot locations over time horizons of a month or more with an accuracy in excess of 99%, and an improved performance of up to 15% against the shallow learning algorithms. Furthermore, in public health operational use, this model highlighted the localized exponential growth of the Alpha variant in late 2020, the Delta variant in April 2021 and the Omicron variant in November 2021 within the United Kingdom prior to their spatial dispersion and growth being confirmed by clinical data.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Machine learning models for identifying predictors of clinical outcomes with first-line immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy in advanced non-small cell lung cancer,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-20061-6,21 Oct 2022,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are standard-of-care as first-line (1L) therapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (aNSCLC) without actionable oncogenic driver mutations. While clinical trials demonstrated benefits of ICIs over chemotherapy, variation in outcomes across patients has been observed and trial populations may not be representative of clinical practice. Predictive models can help understand heterogeneity of treatment effects, identify predictors of meaningful clinical outcomes, and may inform treatment decisions. We applied machine learning (ML)-based survival models to a real-world cohort of patients with aNSCLC who received 1L ICI therapy extracted from a US-based electronic health record database. Model performance was evaluated using metrics including concordance index (c-index), and we used explainability techniques to identify significant predictors of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). The ML model achieved c-indices of 0.672 and 0.612 for OS and PFS, respectively, and Kaplan–Meier survival curves showed significant differences between low- and high-risk groups for OS and PFS (both log-rank test p < 0.0001). Identified predictors were mostly consistent with the published literature and/or clinical expectations and largely overlapped for OS and PFS; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, programmed cell death-ligand 1 expression levels, and serum albumin were among the top 5 predictors for both outcomes. Prospective and independent data set evaluation is required to confirm these results.","We developed a GBDT-CPH model in combination with explainability techniques to identify predictors of OS and PFS among patients with aNSCLC who used ICI-containing regimens as 1L therapy. The GBDT-CPH model improved performance relative to traditional survival models for both OS and PFS. Predictors identified by GBDT-CPH and SHAP significantly overlapped for OS and PFS. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the identified predictors are mostly consistent with the published literature and/or clinical expectations. These results confirm that the application of ML models in combination with EHR data can provide insight regarding clinical outcomes among aNSCLC patients treated with 1L ICIs.","Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

We aimed to assess the sensitivity of neuromelanin-MRI and T2* with radiomics analysis for detecting PD, identifying individuals at risk, and evaluating genotype-related differences. Patients with PD and non-manifesting (NM) participants [NM-carriers (NMC) and NM-non-carriers (NMNC)], underwent MRI and DAT-SPECT. Imaging-based metrics included 48 neuromelanin and T2* radiomics features and DAT-SPECT specific-binding-ratios (SBR), were extracted from several brain regions. Imaging values were assessed for their correlations with age, differences between groups, and correlations with the MDS-likelihood-ratio (LR) score. Several machine learning classifiers were evaluated for group classification. A total of 127 participants were included: 46 patients with PD (62.3 ± 10.0 years) [15:LRRK2-PD, 16:GBA-PD, and 15:idiopathic-PD (iPD)], 47 NMC (51.5 ± 8.3 years) [24:LRRK2-NMC and 23:GBA-NMC], and 34 NMNC (53.5 ± 10.6 years). No significant correlations were detected between imaging parameters and age. Thirteen MRI-based parameters and radiomics features demonstrated significant differences between PD and NMNC groups. Support-Vector-Machine (SVM) classifier achieved the highest performance (AUC = 0.77). Significant correlations were detected between LR scores and two radiomic features. The classifier successfully identified two out of three NMC who converted to PD. Genotype-related differences were detected based on radiomic features. SBR values showed high sensitivity in all analyses. In conclusion, neuromelanin and T2* MRI demonstrated differences between groups and can be used for the assessment of individuals at-risk in cases when DAT-SPECT can’t be performed. Combining neuromelanin and T2*-MRI provides insights into the pathophysiology underlying PD, and suggests that iron accumulation precedes neuromelanin depletion during the prodromal phase.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
CT and cone-beam CT of ablative radiation therapy for pancreatic cancer with expert organ-at-risk contours,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01758-9,21 Oct 2022,"We describe a dataset from patients who received ablative radiation therapy for locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC), consisting of computed tomography (CT) and cone-beam CT (CBCT) images with physician-drawn organ-at-risk (OAR) contours. The image datasets (one CT for treatment planning and two CBCT scans at the time of treatment per patient) were collected from 40 patients. All scans were acquired with the patient in the treatment position and in a deep inspiration breath-hold state. Six radiation oncologists delineated the gastrointestinal OARs consisting of small bowel, stomach and duodenum, such that the same physician delineated all image sets belonging to the same patient. Two trained medical physicists further edited the contours to ensure adherence to delineation guidelines. The image and contour files are available in DICOM format and are publicly available from The Cancer Imaging Archive (https://doi.org/10.7937/TCIA.ESHQ-4D90, Version 2). The dataset can serve as a criterion standard for evaluating the accuracy and reliability of deformable image registration and auto-segmentation algorithms, as well as a training set for deep-learning-based methods.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
"Gene signature of m6A RNA regulators in diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, and immune microenvironment for cervical cancer",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-22211-2,21 Oct 2022,"Continuing studies imply that m6A RNA modification is involved in the development of cervical cancer (CC), but lack strong support on recurrence and diagnosis prediction. In this research, a comprehensive analysis of 33 m6A regulators was performed to fulfill them. Here, we performed diagnostic and prognosis models and identified key regulators, respectively. Then the CC patients were separated into two clusters in accordance with 33 regulators, and participants in the cluster 1 had a worse prognosis. Subsequently, the m6AScore was calculated to quantify the m6A modification pattern based on regulators and we found that patients in cluster 1 had higher m6AScore. Afterwards, immune microenvironment, cell infiltration, escape analyses and tumor burden mutation analyses were executed, and results showed that m6AScore was correlated with them, but to a limited extent. Interestingly, HLAs and immune checkpoint expression, and immunophenoscore in patients with high-m6AScores were significantly lower than those in the low-m6AScore group. These suggested the m6AScores might be used to predict the feasibility of immunotherapy in patients. Results provided a distinctive perspective on m6A modification and theoretical basis for CC diagnosis, prognosis, clinical treatment strategies, and potential mechanism exploration.",Conclusions not available,Traditional ML,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Prediction of malignant lymph nodes in NSCLC by machine-learning classifiers using EBUS-TBNA and PET/CT,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-21637-y,20 Oct 2022,"Accurate determination of lymph-node (LN) metastases is a prerequisite for high precision radiotherapy. The primary aim is to characterise the performance of PET/CT-based machine-learning classifiers to predict LN-involvement by endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) in stage-III NSCLC. Prediction models for LN-positivity based on [18F]FDG-PET/CT features were built using logistic regression and machine-learning models random forest (RF) and multilayer perceptron neural network (MLP) for stage-III NSCLC before radiochemotherapy. A total of 675 LN-stations were sampled in 180 patients. The logistic and RF models identified SUVmax, the short-axis LN-diameter and the echelon of the considered LN among the most important parameters for EBUS-positivity. Adjusting the sensitivity of machine-learning classifiers to that of the expert-rater of 94.5%, MLP (P = 0.0061) and RF models (P = 0.038) showed lower misclassification rates (MCR) than the standard-report, weighting false positives and false negatives equally. Increasing the sensitivity of classifiers from 94.5 to 99.3% resulted in increase of MCR from 13.3/14.5 to 29.8/34.2% for MLP/RF, respectively. PET/CT-based machine-learning classifiers can achieve a high sensitivity (94.5%) to detect EBUS-positive LNs at a low misclassification rate. As the specificity decreases rapidly above that level, a combined test of a PET/CT-based MLP/RF classifier and EBUS-TBNA is recommended for radiation target volume definition.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Deep learning-based classification for lung opacities in chest x-ray radiographs through batch control and sensitivity regulation,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-22506-4,20 Oct 2022,"In this study, we implemented a system to classify lung opacities from frontal chest x-ray radiographs. We also proposed a training method to address the class imbalance problem presented in the dataset. We participated in the Radiological Society of America (RSNA) 2018 Pneumonia Detection Challenge and used the datasets provided by the RSNA for further research. Using convolutional neural networks, we implemented a training procedure termed batch control to manipulate the data distribution of positive and negative cases in each training batch. The batch control method regulated and stabilized the performance of the deep-learning models, allowing the adaptive sensitivity of the network models to meet the specific application. The convolutional neural network is practical for classifying lung opacities on chest x-ray radiographs.

An ED triage tool, the Score for Emergency Risk Prediction (SERP), was previously developed using an interpretable machine learning framework. It achieved a good performance in the Singapore population. We aimed to externally validate the SERP in a Korean cohort for all ED patients and compare its performance with Korean triage acuity scale (KTAS). This retrospective cohort study included all adult ED patients of Samsung Medical Center from 2016 to 2020. The outcomes were 30-day and in-hospital mortality after the patients’ ED visit. We used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) to assess the performance of the SERP and other conventional scores, including KTAS. The study population included 285,523 ED visits, of which 53,541 were after the COVID-19 outbreak (2020). The whole cohort, in-hospital, and 30 days mortality rates were 1.60%, and 3.80%. The SERP achieved an AUROC of 0.821 and 0.803, outperforming KTAS of 0.679 and 0.729 for in-hospital and 30-day mortality, respectively. SERP was superior to other scores for in-hospital and 30-day mortality prediction in an external validation cohort.

HBEGF-TNF induce a complex outer retinal pathology with photoreceptor cell extrusion in human organoids,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-33848-y,19 Oct 2022,"Human organoids could facilitate research of complex and currently incurable neuropathologies, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD) which causes blindness. Here, we establish a human retinal organoid system reproducing several parameters of the human retina, including some within the macula, to model a complex combination of photoreceptor and glial pathologies. We show that combined application of TNF and HBEGF, factors associated with neuropathologies, is sufficient to induce photoreceptor degeneration, glial pathologies, dyslamination, and scar formation: These develop simultaneously and progressively as one complex phenotype. Histologic, transcriptome, live-imaging, and mechanistic studies reveal a previously unknown pathomechanism: Photoreceptor neurodegeneration via cell extrusion. This could be relevant for aging, AMD, and some inherited diseases. Pharmacological inhibitors of the mechanosensor PIEZO1, MAPK, and actomyosin each avert pathogenesis; a PIEZO1 activator induces photoreceptor extrusion. Our model offers mechanistic insights, hypotheses for neuropathologies, and it could be used to develop therapies to prevent vision loss or to regenerate the retina in patients suffering from AMD and other diseases.",Conclusions not available,Gen AI,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Synthesizing realistic high-resolution retina image by style-based generative adversarial network and its utilization,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-20698-3,15 Oct 2022,"Realistic image synthesis based on deep learning is an invaluable technique for developing high-performance computer aided diagnosis systems while protecting patient privacy. However, training a generative adversarial network (GAN) for image synthesis remains challenging because of the large amounts of data required for training various kinds of image features. This study aims to synthesize retinal images indistinguishable from real images and evaluate the efficacy of the synthesized images having a specific disease for augmenting class imbalanced datasets. The synthesized images were validated via image Turing tests, qualitative analysis by retinal specialists, and quantitative analyses on amounts and signal-to-noise ratios of vessels. The efficacy of synthesized images was verified by deep learning-based classification performance. Turing test shows that accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 54.0 ± 12.3%, 71.1 ± 18.8%, and 36.9 ± 25.5%, respectively. Here, sensitivity represents correctness to find real images among real datasets. Vessel amounts and average SNR comparisons show 0.43% and 1.5% difference between real and synthesized images. The classification performance after augmenting synthesized images outperforms every ratio of imbalanced real datasets. Our study shows the realistic retina images were successfully generated with insignificant differences between the real and synthesized images and shows great potential for practical applications.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Identifying pre-existing conditions and multimorbidity patterns associated with in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-20176-w,15 Oct 2022,"We investigated the association between a wide range of comorbidities and COVID-19 in-hospital mortality and assessed the influence of multi morbidity on the risk of COVID-19-related death using a large, regional cohort of 6036 hospitalized patients. This retrospective cohort study was conducted using Patient Administration System Admissions and Discharges data. The International Classification of Diseases 10th edition (ICD-10) diagnosis codes were used to identify common comorbidities and the outcome measure. Individuals with lymphoma (odds ratio [OR], 2.78;95% CI,1.64–4.74), metastatic cancer (OR, 2.17; 95% CI,1.25–3.77), solid tumour without metastasis (OR, 1.67; 95% CI,1.16–2.41), liver disease (OR: 2.50, 95% CI,1.53–4.07), congestive heart failure (OR, 1.69; 95% CI,1.32–2.15), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR, 1.43; 95% CI,1.18–1.72), obesity (OR, 5.28; 95% CI,2.92–9.52), renal disease (OR, 1.81; 95% CI,1.51–2.19), and dementia (OR, 1.44; 95% CI,1.17–1.76) were at increased risk of COVID-19 mortality. Asthma was associated with a lower risk of death compared to non-asthma controls (OR, 0.60; 95% CI,0.42–0.86). Individuals with two (OR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.47–2.20; P < 0.001), and three or more comorbidities (OR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.43–2.27; P < 0.001) were at increasingly higher risk of death when compared to those with no underlying conditions. Furthermore, multi morbidity patterns were analysed by identifying clusters of conditions in hospitalised COVID-19 patients using k-mode clustering, an unsupervised machine learning technique.

Automated detection of pain levels using deep feature extraction from shutter blinds-based dynamic-sized horizontal patches with facial images,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-21380-4,14 Oct 2022,"Pain intensity classification using facial images is a challenging problem in computer vision research. This work proposed a patch and transfer learning-based model to classify various pain intensities using facial images. The input facial images were segmented into dynamic-sized horizontal patches or “shutter blinds”. A lightweight deep network DarkNet19 pre-trained on ImageNet1K was used to generate deep features from the shutter blinds and the undivided resized segmented input facial image. The most discriminative features were selected from these deep features using iterative neighborhood component analysis, which were then fed to a standard shallow fine k-nearest neighbor classifier for classification using tenfold cross-validation. The proposed shutter blinds-based model was trained and tested on datasets derived from two public databases—University of Northern British Columbia-McMaster Shoulder Pain Expression Archive Database and Denver Intensity of Spontaneous Facial Action Database—which both comprised four pain intensity classes that had been labeled by human experts using validated facial action coding system methodology. Our shutter blinds-based classification model attained more than 95% overall accuracy rates on both datasets. The excellent performance suggests that the automated pain intensity classification model can be deployed to assist doctors in the non-verbal detection of pain using facial images in various situations (e.g., non-communicative patients or during surgery). This system can facilitate timely detection and management of pain.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Convolutional neural network-based classification of cervical intraepithelial neoplasias using colposcopic image segmentation for acetowhite epithelium,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-21692-5,14 Oct 2022,"Colposcopy is a test performed to detect precancerous lesions of cervical cancer. Since cervical cancer progresses slowly, finding and treating precancerous lesions helps prevent cervical cancer. In particular, it is clinically important to detect high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) that require surgical treatment among precancerous lesions of cervix. There have been several studies using convolutional neural network (CNN) for classifying colposcopic images. However, no studies have been reported on using the segmentation technique to detect HSIL. In present study, we aimed to examine whether the accuracy of a CNN model in detecting HSIL from colposcopic images can be improved when segmentation information for acetowhite epithelium is added. Without segmentation information, ResNet-18, 50, and 101 achieved classification accuracies of 70.2%, 66.2%, and 69.3%, respectively. The experts classified the same test set with accuracies of 74.6% and 73.0%. After adding segmentation information of acetowhite epithelium to the original images, the classification accuracies of ResNet-18, 50, and 101 improved to 74.8%, 76.3%, and 74.8%, respectively. We demonstrated that the HSIL detection accuracy improved by adding segmentation information to the CNN model, and the improvement in accuracy was consistent across different ResNets.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Investigation of radiomics based intra-patient inter-tumor heterogeneity and the impact of tumor subsampling strategies,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-20931-z,14 Oct 2022,"While radiomics analysis has been applied for localized cancer disease, its application to the metastatic setting involves a non-exhaustive lesion subsampling strategy which may sidestep the intrapatient tumoral heterogeneity, hindering the reproducibility and the therapeutic response performance. Our aim was to evaluate if radiomics features can capture intertumoral intrapatient heterogeneity, and the impact of tumor subsampling on the computed heterogeneity. To this end, We delineated and extracted radiomics features of all visible tumors from single acquisition pre-treatment computed tomography of patients with metastatic lung cancer (cohort L) and confirmed our results on a larger cohort of patients with metastatic melanoma (cohort M). To quantify the captured heterogeneity, the absolute coefficient of variation (CV) of each radiomics index was calculated at the patient-level and a sensitivity analysis was performed using only a subset of all extracted features robust to the segmentation step. The extent of information loss by six commonly used tumor sampling strategies was then assessed. A total of 602 lesions were segmented from 43 patients (median age 57, 4.9% female). All robust radiomics indexes exhibited at least 20% of variation with significant heterogeneity both in heavily and oligo metastasized patients, and also at the organ level. None of the segmentation subsampling strategies were able to recover the true tumoral heterogeneity obtained by exhaustive tumor sampling. Image-based inter-tumor intra-patient heterogeneity can be successfully grasped by radiomics analyses. Failing to take into account this kind of heterogeneity will lead to inconsistent predictive algorithms. Guidelines to standardize the tumor sampling step and/or AI-driven tools to alleviate the segmentation effort are required.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

A stacking ensemble machine learning model to predict alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency-associated liver disease clinical outcomes based on UK Biobank data,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-21389-9,11 Oct 2022,"Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency associated liver disease (AATD-LD) is a rare genetic disorder and not well-recognized. Predicting the clinical outcomes of AATD-LD and defining patients more likely to progress to advanced liver disease are crucial for better understanding AATD-LD progression and promoting timely medical intervention. We aimed to develop a tailored machine learning (ML) model to predict the disease progression of AATD-LD. This analysis was conducted through a stacking ensemble learning model by combining five different ML algorithms with 58 predictor variables using nested five-fold cross-validation with repetitions based on the UK Biobank data. Performance of the model was assessed through prediction accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC), and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC). The importance of predictor contributions was evaluated through a feature importance permutation method. The proposed stacking ensemble ML model showed clinically meaningful accuracy and appeared superior to any single ML algorithms in the ensemble, e.g., the AUROC for AATD-LD was 68.1%, 75.9%, 91.2%, and 67.7% for all-cause mortality, liver-related death, liver transplant, and all-cause mortality or liver transplant, respectively.

Here, by assessing 1,183 plasma metabolites in 1,368 extensively phenotyped individuals from the Lifelines DEEP and Genome of the Netherlands cohorts, we quantified the proportion of inter-individual variation in the plasma metabolome explained by different factors, characterizing 610, 85 and 38 metabolites as dominantly associated with diet, the gut microbiome and genetics, respectively. Moreover, a diet quality score derived from metabolite levels was significantly associated with diet quality, as assessed by a detailed food frequency questionnaire. Through Mendelian randomization and mediation analyses, we revealed putative causal relationships between diet, the gut microbiome and metabolites. For example, Mendelian randomization analyses support a potential causal effect of Eubacterium rectale in decreasing plasma levels of hydrogen sulfite—a toxin that affects cardiovascular function. Lastly, based on analysis of the plasma metabolome of 311 individuals at two time points separated by 4 years, we observed a positive correlation between the stability of metabolite levels and the amount of variance in the levels of that metabolite that could be explained in our analysis.

Machine learning-based derivation and external validation of a tool to predict death and development of organ failure in hospitalized patients with COVID-19,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-20724-4,08 Oct 2022,"COVID-19 mortality risk stratification tools could improve care, inform accurate and rapid triage decisions, and guide family discussions regarding goals of care. A minority of COVID-19 prognostic tools have been tested in external cohorts. Our objective was to compare machine learning algorithms and develop a tool for predicting subsequent clinical outcomes in COVID-19. We conducted a retrospective cohort study that included hospitalized patients with COVID-19 from March 2020 to March 2021. Seven Hundred Twelve consecutive patients from University of Washington  and 345 patients from Tongji Hospital in China were included. We applied three different machine learning algorithms to clinical and laboratory data collected within the initial 24 h of hospital admission to determine the risk of in-hospital mortality, transfer to the intensive care unit, shock requiring vasopressors, and receipt of renal replacement therapy. Mortality risk models were derived, internally validated in UW and externally validated in Tongji Hospital. The risk models for ICU transfer, shock and RRT were derived and internally validated in the UW dataset but were unable to be externally validated due to a lack of data on these outcomes. Among the UW dataset, 122 patients died (17%) during hospitalization and the mean days to hospital mortality was 15.7 +/− 21.5 (mean +/− SD). Elastic net logistic regression resulted in a C-statistic for in-hospital mortality of 0.72 (95% CI, 0.64 to 0.81) in the internal validation and 0.85 (95% CI, 0.81 to 0.89) in the external validation set. Age, platelet count, and white blood cell count were the most important predictors of mortality. In the sub-group of patients > 50 years of age, the mortality prediction model continued to perform with a C-statistic of 0.82 (95% CI:0.76,0.87). Prediction models also performed well for shock and RRT in the UW dataset but functioned with lower accuracy for ICU transfer. We trained, internally and externally validated a prediction model using data collected within 24 h of hospital admission to predict in-hospital mortality on average two weeks prior to death. We also developed models to predict RRT and shock with high accuracy. These models could be used to improve triage decisions, resource allocation, and support clinical trial enrichment.","We developed prediction models with high discrimination for mortality, shock and RRT.

The mortality prediction model on average was able to identify future risk of mortality 2 weeks prior to the clinical outcome. All variables to develop the prediction models used clinical variables collected within the first day of hospital admission.

Multi-omics disease module detection with an explainable Greedy Decision Forest,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-21417-8,07 Oct 2022,"Machine learning methods can detect complex relationships between variables, but usually do not exploit domain knowledge. This is a limitation because in many scientific disciplines, such as systems biology, domain knowledge is available in the form of graphs or networks, and its use can improve model performance. We need network-based algorithms that are versatile and applicable in many research areas. In this work, we demonstrate subnetwork detection based on multi-modal node features using a novel Greedy Decision Forest (GDF) with inherent interpretability. The latter will be a crucial factor to retain experts and gain their trust in such algorithms. To demonstrate a concrete application example, we focus on bioinformatics, systems biology and particularly biomedicine, but the presented methodology is applicable in many other domains as well. Systems biology is a good example of a field in which statistical data-driven machine learning enables the analysis of large amounts of multi-modal biomedical data. This is important to reach the future goal of precision medicine, where the complexity of patients is modeled on a system level to best tailor medical decisions, health practices and therapies to the individual patient.

Design and testing of CASA algorithms can be accelerated greatly if reliable simulations of semen images under a variety of conditions and sample quality modes are available. Using life-like simulation of semen images can quantify the performance of existing and proposed CASA algorithms, since the parameters of the simulated image are known and controllable. We present simulation models for sperm cell image and swimming modes observed in real 2D (top-down) images of sperm cells in laboratory specimen. The models simulate human sperm using four (4) types of swimming, namely linear mean, circular, hyperactive, and immotile (or dead). The simulation models are used in studying algorithms for segmentation, localization, and tracking of sperm cells. Several segmentation and localization algorithms were tested under varying levels of noise, and then compared using precision, recall, and the optimal subpattern assignment (OSPA) metric. Images of real human semen sample were used to validate the segmentation and localization observations obtained from simulations. An example is given of sperm cell tracking on simulated semen images of cells using the different tracking algorithms (nearest neighbor (NN), global nearest neighbor (GNN), probabilistic data association filter (PDAF), and joint probabilistic data association filter (JPDAF)). Tracking performance was evaluated through multi-object tracking precision (MOTP) and multi-object tracking accuracy (MOTA). Simulation models enable objective assessments of semen image processing algorithms. We demonstrate the use of a new simulation tool to assess and compare segmentation, localization, and tracking methods. The simulation software allows testing along a large spectrum of parameter values that control the appearance and behavior of simulated semen images. Users can generate scenarios of different characteristics and assess the effectiveness of different CASA algorithms in these environments.

Of GI-patients, 62.5% reported to be familiar with AI and 25.0% of GI-physicians had work-related experience with AI. GI-patients preferred their physicians to use AI (mean 3.9) and GI-physicians were willing to use AI (mean 4.4, on 5-point Likert-scale). More GI-physicians believed in an increase in quality of care (81.3%) than GI-patients (64.9%, χ2(2) = 8.2, p = 0.017). GI-fellows expected AI implementation within 6.0 years, gastroenterologists within 4.2 years (t(76) =  − 2.6, p = 0.011), and GI-patients within 6.1 years (t(193) =  − 2.0, p = 0.047). GI-patients and GI-physicians agreed on the most important advantages of AI in healthcare: improving quality of care, time saving, and faster diagnostics and shorter waiting times. The most important disadvantage for GI-patients was the potential loss of personal contact, for GI-physicians this was insufficiently developed IT infrastructures. GI-patients and GI-physicians hold positive perspectives towards AI in healthcare. Patients were significantly more reserved compared to GI-fellows and GI-fellows were more reserved compared to gastroenterologists.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Modeling of smoking intensity by age at smoking onset among Iranian adult male using generalized additive model,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-21194-4,06 Oct 2022,"Because the age at which a person first starts smoking has such a strong correlation with future smoking behaviours, it's crucial to examine its relationship with smoking intensity. However, it is still challenging to accurately prove this relationship due to limitations in the methodology of the performed studies. Therefore the main purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential risk factors affecting the intensity of smoking, especially the age of smoking onset among Iranian adult male smokers over 18 years of age using a  generalized additive model (GAM). In GAM a latent variable with logistic distribution and identity link function was considered. Data from 913 Iranian male current smokers over the age of 18 was evaluated from a national cross-sectional survey of non-communicable disease (NCD) risk factors in 2016. Individuals were classified into: light, moderate, and heavy smokers. A GAM was used to assess the relationship. The results showed that 246 (26.9%) subjects were light smokers, 190 (20.8%) subjects were moderate smokers and 477 (52.2%) subjects were heavy smokers. According to the GAM results, the relationship was nonlinear and smokers who started smoking at a younger age were more likely to become heavy smokers. The factors of unemployment (OR = 1.364, 95% CI 0.725–2.563), retirement (OR = 1.217, 95% CI 0.667–2.223), and exposure to secondhand smoke at home (OR = 1.364, 95% CI 1.055–1.763) increased the risk of heavy smoking. but, smokers with high-income (OR = 0.742, 95% CI 0.552–0.998) had a low tendency to heavy smoking. GAM identified the nonlinear relationship between the age of onset of smoking and smoking intensity. Tobacco control programs should be focused on young and adolescent groups and poorer socio-economic communities.","According to the results of this study, poorer socioeconomic status as well as starting smoking at a younger age is associated with heavy smoking. Also, men in the age group of 40 to 70 years had higher consumption intensity than other age groups. Therefore, more intensive consumption and its adverse consequences in adulthood can be predicted by these factors.","Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: ; Attacker Capability: 
Convolutional neural network-based respiration analysis of electrical activities of the diaphragm,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-21165-9,05 Oct 2022,"The electrical activity of the diaphragm (Edi) is considered a new respiratory vital sign for monitoring breathing patterns and efforts during ventilator care. However, the Edi signal contains irregular noise from complex causes, which makes reliable breathing analysis difficult. Deep learning was implemented to accurately detect the Edi signal peaks and analyze actual neural breathing in premature infants. Edi signals were collected from 17 premature infants born before gestational age less than 32 weeks, who received ventilatory support with a non-invasive neurally adjusted ventilatory assist. First, a local maximal detection method that over-detects candidate Edi peaks was used. Subsequently, a convolutional neural network-based deep learning was implemented to classify candidates into final Edi peaks. Our approach showed superior performance in all aspects of respiratory Edi peak detection and neural breathing analysis compared with the currently used recording technique in the ventilator. The method obtained a f1-score of 0.956 for the Edi peak detection performance and \({R}^{2}\) value of 0.823 for respiratory rates based on the number of Edi peaks. The proposed technique can achieve a more reliable analysis of Edi signals, including evaluation of the respiration rate in premature infants.","We proposed a deep learning-based two-stage method to analyze the Edi of premature infants with a large amount of noise in the signal. The proposed method estimated the respiratory rates of premature infants more reliably by detecting Edi peaks more precisely. Because the proposed method showed promising results in all aspects of respiratory Edi peak detection performance in comparison with other methods, it could be used as a pre-processing step in building a respiration big data registry for analysis or machine learning processes.In the future, this research can be extended to studies of (1) real-time Edi signal monitoring that provides information on the patient’s respiration, and (2) detection of inspiration beginning for breathing support during ventilator-assisted delivery through a manner similar to this study. These two additional studies based on the proposed method will help premature infants who require precise respiratory monitoring and assistance.",DNN,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
A whole-body FDG-PET/CT Dataset with manually annotated Tumor Lesions,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01718-3,04 Oct 2022,"We describe a publicly available dataset of annotated Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) studies. 1014 whole body Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET/CT datasets (501 studies of patients with malignant lymphoma, melanoma and non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and 513 studies without PET-positive malignant lesions (negative controls)) acquired between 2014 and 2018 were included. All examinations were acquired on a single, state-of-the-art PET/CT scanner. The imaging protocol consisted of a whole-body FDG-PET acquisition and a corresponding diagnostic CT scan. All FDG-avid lesions identified as malignant based on the clinical PET/CT report were manually segmented on PET images in a slice-per-slice (3D) manner. We provide the anonymized original DICOM files of all studies as well as the corresponding DICOM segmentation masks. In addition, we provide scripts for image processing and conversion to different file formats (NIfTI, mha, hdf5). Primary diagnosis, age and sex are provided as non-imaging information.

Energy intake estimation using a novel wearable sensor and food images in a laboratory (pseudo-free-living) meal setting: quantification and contribution of sources of error,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41366-022-01225-w,03 Oct 2022,"Dietary assessment methods not relying on self-report are needed. The Automatic Ingestion Monitor 2 (AIM-2) combines a wearable camera that captures food images with sensors that detect food intake. We compared energy intake (EI) estimates of meals derived from AIM-2 chewing sensor signals, AIM-2 images, and an internet-based diet diary, with researcher conducted weighed food records (WFR) as the gold standard.","Here, we presented a novel wearable sensor system that can estimate EI of meals from sensors and images without the need of any fiducial markers in the images. The sensor-based model had the best results compared with WFR versus image analysis or an internet-based food diary. The greatest sources of error were from portion size inaccuracies due to nutritionist error and inaccurate portion sizes of foods in the reference databases used for image analysis, suggesting that focus on these two sources of error should be guiding future development of improved computer-based methods for food image analysis than currently exist. Overall, the findings provide good evidence that the sensor-based model may provide a valid estimate of meal EI in a simulated free-living environment. Developmental research is still needed before the method can be widely used.","Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: ; Attacker Capability: 
Understanding multimorbidity trajectories in Scotland using sequence analysis,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-20546-4,01 Oct 2022,"Understanding how multiple conditions develop over time is of growing interest, but there is currently limited methodological development on the topic, especially in understanding how multimorbidity (the co-existence of at least two chronic conditions) develops longitudinally and in which order diseases occur. We aim to describe how a longitudinal method, sequence analysis, can be used to understand the sequencing of common chronic diseases that lead to multimorbidity and the socio-demographic factors and health outcomes associated with typical disease trajectories. We use the Scottish Longitudinal Study (SLS) linking the Scottish census 2001 to disease registries, hospitalisation and mortality records. SLS participants aged 40–74 years at baseline were followed over a 10-year period (2001–2011) for the onset of three commonly occurring diseases: diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and cancer. We focused on participants who transitioned to at least two of these conditions over the follow-up period (N = 6300). We use sequence analysis with optimal matching and hierarchical cluster analysis to understand the process of disease sequencing and to distinguish typical multimorbidity trajectories. Socio-demographic differences between specific disease trajectories were evaluated using multinomial logistic regression. Poisson and Cox regressions were used to assess differences in hospitalisation and mortality outcomes between typical trajectories. Individuals who transitioned to multimorbidity over 10 years were more likely to be older and living in more deprived areas than the rest of the population. We found seven typical trajectories: later fast transition to multimorbidity, CVD start with slow transition to multimorbidity, cancer start with slow transition to multimorbidity, diabetes start with slow transition to multimorbidity, fast transition to both diabetes and CVD, fast transition to multimorbidity and death, fast transition to both cancer and CVD. Those who quickly transitioned to multimorbidity and death were the most vulnerable, typically older, less educated, and more likely to live in more deprived areas. They also experienced higher number of hospitalisations and overnight stays while still alive. Sequence analysis can strengthen our understanding of typical disease trajectories when considering a few key diseases. This may have implications for more active clinical review of patients beginning quick transition trajectories.","Understanding the sociodemographic profile and outcomes of diverse typical trajectories of multimorbidity is complex. This complexity was revealed using sequence analysis based on a small set of commonly occurring diseases (diabetes, CVD and cancer) to characterise trajectories to multimorbidity. Further methodological work should consider scaling up to more diseases, or if disease progression data were available, using multi-channel sequence analysis to explore parallel detailed disease trajectories. However, when considering more than a few diseases, other methods, such as machine learning, may be more appropriate. Scaling up, however, will come with the challenge of interpreting findings and drawing meaningful conclusions from a very large number of trajectories.",Traditional ML,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
"Machine-learning algorithms for asthma, COPD, and lung cancer risk assessment using circulating microbial extracellular vesicle data and their application to assess dietary effects",https://www.nature.com/articles/s12276-022-00846-5,30 Sept 2022,"Although mounting evidence suggests that the microbiome has a tremendous influence on intractable disease, the relationship between circulating microbial extracellular vesicles (EVs) and respiratory disease remains unexplored. Here, we developed predictive diagnostic models for COPD, asthma, and lung cancer by applying machine learning to microbial EV metagenomes isolated from patient serum and coded by their accumulated taxonomic hierarchy. All models demonstrated high predictive strength with mean AUC values ranging from 0.93 to 0.99 with various important features at the genus and phylum levels. Application of the clinical models in mice showed that various foods reduced high-fat diet-associated asthma and lung cancer risk, while COPD was minimally affected. In conclusion, this study offers a novel methodology for respiratory disease prediction and highlights the utility of serum microbial EVs as data-rich features for noninvasive diagnosis.",Conclusions not available,Gen AI,Attack Types: evasion; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Evaluation of electrolyte element composition in human tissue by laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS),https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-20825-0,30 Sept 2022,"Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) enables the direct measurement of cell electrolyte concentrations. The utility of LIBS spectra in biomarker studies is limited because these studies rarely consider basic physical principles. The aim of this study was to test the suitability of LIBS spectra as an analytical method for biomarker assays and to evaluate the composition of electrolyte elements in human biomaterial. LIBS as an analytical method was evaluated by establishing KCl calibration curves to demonstrate linearity, by the correct identification of emission lines with corresponding reference spectra, and by the feasibility to use LIBS in human biomaterial, analyzing striated muscle tissues from the oral regions of two patients. Lorentzian peak fit and peak area calculations resulted in better linearity and reduced shot-to-shot variance. Correct quantitative measurement allowed for differentiation of human biomaterial between patients, and determination of the concentration ratios of main electrolytes within human tissue. The clinical significance of LIBS spectra should be evaluated using peak area rather than peak intensity. LIBS might be a promising tool for analyzing a small group of living cells. Due to linearity, specificity and robustness of the proposed analytical method, LIBS could be a component of future biomarker studies.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Cost-effective methylome sequencing of cell-free DNA for accurately detecting and locating cancer,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-32995-6,29 Sept 2022,"Early cancer detection by cell-free DNA faces multiple challenges: low fraction of tumor cell-free DNA, molecular heterogeneity of cancer, and sample sizes that are not sufficient to reflect diverse patient populations. Here, we develop a cancer detection approach to address these challenges. It consists of an assay, cfMethyl-Seq, for cost-effective sequencing of the cell-free DNA methylome (with > 12-fold enrichment over whole genome bisulfite sequencing in CpG islands), and a computational method to extract methylation information and diagnose patients. Applying our approach to 408 colon, liver, lung, and stomach cancer patients and controls, at 97.9% specificity we achieve 80.7% and 74.5% sensitivity in detecting all-stage and early-stage cancer, and 89.1% and 85.0% accuracy for locating tissue-of-origin of all-stage and early-stage cancer, respectively. Our approach cost-effectively retains methylome profiles of cancer abnormalities, allowing us to learn new features and expand to other cancer types as training cohorts grow.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Transformer and group parallel axial attention co-encoder for medical image segmentation,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-20440-z,27 Sept 2022,"U-Net has become baseline standard in the medical image segmentation tasks, but it has limitations in explicitly modeling long-term dependencies. Transformer has the ability to capture long-term relevance through its internal self-attention. However, Transformer is committed to modeling the correlation of all elements, but its awareness of local foreground information is not significant. Since medical images are often presented as regional blocks, local information is equally important. In this paper, we propose the GPA-TUNet by considering local and global information synthetically. Specifically, we propose a new attention mechanism to highlight local foreground information, called group parallel axial attention (GPA). Furthermore, we effectively combine GPA with Transformer in encoder part of model. It can not only highlight the foreground information of samples, but also reduce the negative influence of background information on the segmentation results. Meanwhile, we introduced the sMLP block to improve the global modeling capability of network. Sparse connectivity and weight sharing are well achieved by applying it. Extensive experiments on public datasets confirm the excellent performance of our proposed GPA-TUNet. In particular, on Synapse and ACDC datasets, mean DSC(%) reached 80.37% and 90.37% respectively, mean HD95(mm) reached 20.55 and 1.23 respectively.","In this paper, we propose a new attention mechanism: Group Parallel Axial Attention (GPA), which enables local information modeling by computing feature weights in parallel with attention in different directions (horizontal and vertical) of the image. Combining GPA with Transformer, co-encoder GPA-TUNet is constructed to explore performance for medical image segmentation. It not only obtains sample local correlations by GPA based on pixel level, but also encodes powerful global context by Transformer with image features as sequences. Furthermore, we introduce sMLP to strengthen the global information dependence, which relies on sparse connections and weight sharing. The whole structure adopts U-shape structure, thus also preserving the coarse-grained features of CNN. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GPA-TUNet jointly models local information dependencies and global correlation dependencies properly. It is especially remarkable for the segmentation performance of organs with large axial spans. Compared with various other existing methods, GPA-TUNet achieves optimal segmentation results on two different publicly available datasets. GPA-TUNet has poor segmentation performance for small organs. The reason is that there are fewer axial reference pixels for small organs, and the model easily misjudges foreground information as background information. For the shortcomings of this paper, we will continue to improve in the future.","DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: ; Attacker Capability: 
Estimating individual treatment effect on disability progression in multiple sclerosis using deep learning,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-33269-x,26 Sept 2022,"Disability progression in multiple sclerosis remains resistant to treatment. The absence of a suitable biomarker to allow for phase 2 clinical trials presents a high barrier for drug development. We propose to enable short proof-of-concept trials by increasing statistical power using a deep-learning predictive enrichment strategy. Specifically, a multi-headed multilayer perceptron is used to estimate the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) using baseline clinical and imaging features, and patients predicted to be most responsive are preferentially randomized into a trial. Leveraging data from six randomized clinical trials (n = 3,830), we first pre-trained the model on the subset of relapsing-remitting MS patients (n = 2,520), then fine-tuned it on a subset of primary progressive MS (PPMS) patients (n = 695). In a separate held-out test set of PPMS patients randomized to anti-CD20 antibodies or placebo (n = 297), the average treatment effect was larger for the 50% (HR, 0.492; 95% CI, 0.266-0.912; p = 0.0218) and 30% (HR, 0.361; 95% CI, 0.165-0.79; p = 0.008) predicted to be most responsive, compared to 0.743 (95% CI, 0.482-1.15; p = 0.179) for the entire group. The same model could also identify responders to laquinimod in another held-out test set of PPMS patients (n = 318).

Automated detection of enlarged extraocular muscle in Graves’ ophthalmopathy with computed tomography and deep neural network,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-20279-4,26 Sept 2022,"This study aimed to develop a diagnostic software system to evaluate the enlarged extraocular muscles (EEM) in patients with Graves’ ophthalmopathy (GO) by a deep neural network.This prospective observational study involved 371 participants (199 EEM patients with GO and 172 controls with normal extraocular muscles) whose extraocular muscles were examined with orbital coronal computed tomography. When at least one rectus muscle (right or left superior, inferior, medial, or lateral) in the patients was 4.0 mm or larger, it was classified as an EEM patient with GO.

We then validated the performance of the network. In the test data, the area under the curve was 0.946 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.894–0.998), and receiver operating characteristic analysis demonstrated 92.5% (95% CI 0.796–0.984) sensitivity and 88.6% (95% CI 0.733–0.968) specificity.

Forecasting admissions in psychiatric hospitals before and during Covid-19: a retrospective study with routine data,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-20190-y,23 Sept 2022,"The COVID-19 pandemic has strong effects on most health care systems. Forecasting of admissions can help for the efficient organisation of hospital care. We aimed to forecast the number of admissions to psychiatric hospitals before and during the COVID-19 pandemic and we compared the performance of machine learning models and time series models. This would eventually allow to support timely resource allocation for optimal treatment of patients. We used admission data from 9 psychiatric hospitals in Germany between 2017 and 2020. We compared machine learning models with time series models in weekly, monthly and yearly forecasting before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 90,686 admissions were analysed. The models explained up to 90% of variance in hospital admissions in 2019 and 75% in 2020 with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The best models substantially outperformed a one-step seasonal naïve forecast (seasonal mean absolute scaled error (sMASE) 2019: 0.59, 2020: 0.76). The best model in 2019 was a machine learning model (elastic net, mean absolute error (MAE): 7.25). The best model in 2020 was a time series model (exponential smoothing state space model with Box-Cox transformation, ARMA errors and trend and seasonal components, MAE: 10.44). Models forecasting admissions one week in advance did not perform better than monthly and yearly models in 2019 but they did in 2020. The most important features for the machine learning models were calendrical variables. Model performance did not vary much between different modelling approaches before the COVID-19 pandemic and established forecasts were substantially better than one-step seasonal naïve forecasts. However, weekly time series models adjusted quicker to the COVID-19 related shock effects. In practice, multiple individual forecast horizons could be used simultaneously, such as a yearly model to achieve early forecasts for a long planning period and weekly models to adjust quicker to sudden changes.","Accurate forecasting of hospital admissions can help for the efficient organisation of hospital care and for the adjustment of resources to sudden changes in patient volumes.

Integrated multimodal artificial intelligence framework for healthcare applications,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-022-00689-4,20 Sept 2022,"Artificial intelligence (AI) systems hold great promise to improve healthcare over the next decades. Specifically, AI systems leveraging multiple data sources and input modalities are poised to become a viable method to deliver more accurate results and deployable pipelines across a wide range of applications. In this work, we propose and evaluate a unified Holistic AI in Medicine (HAIM) framework to facilitate the generation and testing of AI systems that leverage multimodal inputs. Our approach uses generalizable data pre-processing and machine learning modeling stages that can be readily adapted for research and deployment in healthcare environments. We evaluate our HAIM framework by training and characterizing 14,324 independent models based on HAIM-MIMIC-MM, a multimodal clinical database (N = 34,537 samples) containing 7279 unique hospitalizations and 6485 patients, spanning all possible input combinations of 4 data modalities (i.e., tabular, time-series, text, and images), 11 unique data sources and 12 predictive tasks. We show that this framework can consistently and robustly produce models that outperform similar single-source approaches across various healthcare demonstrations (by 6–33%), including 10 distinct chest pathology diagnoses, along with length-of-stay and 48 h mortality predictions. We also quantify the contribution of each modality and data source using Shapley values, which demonstrates the heterogeneity in data modality importance and the necessity of multimodal inputs across different healthcare-relevant tasks. The generalizable properties and flexibility of our Holistic AI in Medicine (HAIM) framework could offer a promising pathway for future multimodal predictive systems in clinical and operational healthcare settings.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Label-free intraoperative histology of bone tissue via deep-learning-assisted ultraviolet photoacoustic microscopy,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-022-00940-z,19 Sept 2022,"Obtaining frozen sections of bone tissue for intraoperative examination is challenging. To identify the bony edge of resection, orthopaedic oncologists therefore rely on pre-operative X-ray computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. However, these techniques do not allow for accurate diagnosis or for intraoperative confirmation of the tumour margins, and in bony sarcomas, they can lead to bone margins up to 10-fold wider (1,000-fold volumetrically) than necessary. Here, we show that real-time three-dimensional contour-scanning of tissue via ultraviolet photoacoustic microscopy in reflection mode can be used to intraoperatively evaluate undecalcified and decalcified thick bone specimens, without the need for tissue sectioning. We validate the technique with gold-standard haematoxylin-and-eosin histology images acquired via a traditional optical microscope, and also show that an unsupervised generative adversarial network can virtually stain the ultraviolet-photoacoustic-microscopy images, allowing pathologists to readily identify cancerous features.

Identification and characterization of the kynurenine pathway in the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-19652-0,16 Sept 2022,"Dysregulation of the kynurenine pathway (KP) is implicated in many human diseases and disorders, from immunological, metabolic, neurodegenerative, and neuropsychiatric conditions to cancer, and represents an appealing target for new therapeutic approaches. In this intricate scenario, invertebrates, like Lymnaea stagnalis (LS), provide a flexible tool to unravel the complexity of the KP. Starting from the available LS genome and transcriptome, we identified putative transcripts of all KP enzymes containing an ORF; each predicted protein possessed a high degree of sequence conservation to known orthologues of other invertebrate and vertebrate model organisms. Sequences were confirmed by qualitative PCR and sequencing. At the same time, the qRT-PCR analysis revealed that Lym IDO-like, Lym TDO-like, Lym AFMID-like, Lym KMO-like, Lym AADAT-like, Lym KYAT I/III-like, Lym KYNU-like, Lym HAAO-like, and Lym ACMSD-like showed widespread tissue expression.

Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify the clinical factors and semantic features of MRI scans. Radiomics features were extracted from five MRI sequences using radiomics software. Three feature selection methods and six classifiers were evaluated in the training cohort to construct favorable radiomic machine-learning classifiers. The performance of different classifiers was evaluated using the AUC and compared to neuroradiologists. The detection rates of T1WI, T2WI, and CE-T1WI for parasellar cavernous hemangiomas and meningiomas were approximately 100%. In contrast, the ADC maps had the detection rate of 18/22 and 19/25, respectively, (AUC, 0.881) with 2.25 cm as the critical value diameter. Radiomics models with the SVM and KNN classifiers based on T2WI and ADC maps had favorable predictive performances (AUC > 0.90 and F-score value > 0.80).

Discrete-time survival analysis in the critically ill: a deep learning approach using heterogeneous data,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-022-00679-6,14 Sept 2022,"Prediction of survival for patients in intensive care units (ICUs) has been subject to intense research. However, no models exist that embrace the multiverse of data in ICUs. It is an open question whether deep learning methods using automated data integration with minimal pre-processing of mixed data domains such as free text, medical history and high-frequency data can provide discrete-time survival estimates for individual ICU patients. We trained a deep learning model on data from patients admitted to ten ICUs in the Capital Region of Denmark and the Region of Southern Denmark between 2011 and 2018. Inspired by natural language processing we mapped the electronic patient record data to an embedded representation and fed the data to a recurrent neural network with a multi-label output layer representing the chance of survival at different follow-up times. We evaluated the performance using the time-dependent concordance index. In addition, we quantified and visualized the drivers of survival predictions using the SHAP methodology. We included 37,355 admissions of 29,417 patients in our study. Our deep learning models outperformed traditional Cox proportional-hazard models with concordance index in the ranges 0.72–0.73, 0.71–0.72, 0.71, and 0.69–0.70, for models applied at baseline 0, 24, 48, and 72 h, respectively. Deep learning models based on a combination of entity embeddings and survival modelling is a feasible approach to obtain individualized survival estimates in data-rich settings such as the ICU. The interpretable nature of the models enables us to understand the impact of the different data domains.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Deep neural networks allow expert-level brain meningioma segmentation and present potential for improvement of clinical practice,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-19356-5,14 Sept 2022,"Accurate brain meningioma segmentation and volumetric assessment are critical for serial patient follow-up, surgical planning and monitoring response to treatment. Current gold standard of manual labeling is a time-consuming process, subject to inter-user variability. Fully-automated algorithms for meningioma segmentation have the potential to bring volumetric analysis into clinical and research workflows by increasing accuracy and efficiency, reducing inter-user variability and saving time. Previous research has focused solely on segmentation tasks without assessment of impact and usability of deep learning solutions in clinical practice. Herein, we demonstrate a three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) that performs expert-level, automated meningioma segmentation and volume estimation on MRI scans. A 3D-CNN was initially trained by segmenting entire brain volumes using a dataset of 10,099 healthy brain MRIs. Using transfer learning, the network was then specifically trained on meningioma segmentation using 806 expert-labeled MRIs. The final model achieved a median performance of 88.2% reaching the spectrum of current inter-expert variability (82.6–91.6%). We demonstrate in a simulated clinical scenario that a deep learning approach to meningioma segmentation is feasible, highly accurate and has the potential to improve current clinical practice.",Conclusions not available,DNN,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Deep learning-based quantitative estimation of lymphedema-induced fibrosis using three-dimensional computed tomography images,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-19204-6,13 Sept 2022,"In lymphedema, proinflammatory cytokine-mediated progressive cascades always occur, leading to macroscopic fibrosis. However, no methods are practically available for measuring lymphedema-induced fibrosis before its deterioration. Technically, CT can visualize fibrosis in superficial and deep locations. For standardized measurement, verification of deep learning (DL)-based recognition was performed. A cross-sectional, observational cohort trial was conducted. After narrowing window width of the absorptive values in CT images, SegNet-based semantic segmentation model of every pixel into 5 classes (air, skin, muscle/water, fat, and fibrosis) was trained (65%), validated (15%), and tested (20%). Then, 4 indices were formulated and compared with the standardized circumference difference ratio (SCDR) and bioelectrical impedance (BEI) results. In total, 2138 CT images of 27 chronic unilateral lymphedema patients were analyzed. Regarding fibrosis segmentation, the mean boundary F1 score and accuracy were 0.868 and 0.776, respectively. Among 19 subindices of the 4 indices, 73.7% were correlated with the BEI (partial correlation coefficient: 0.420–0.875), and 13.2% were correlated with the SCDR (0.406–0.460). The mean subindex of Index 2 \(\left( {\frac{{P_{Fibrosis\, in\, Affected} - P_{Fibrosis\, in\, Unaffected} }}{{P_{Limb\, in\, Unaffected} }}} \right)\) presented the highest correlation. DL has potential applications in CT image-based lymphedema-induced fibrosis recognition. The subtraction-type formula might be the most promising estimation method.","To show the validity of the DL-based algorithm for identifying lymphedema-induced fibrosis in CT scans, a cross-sectional, observational cohort trial was conducted, and the proposed algorithm was compared with the two gold standard measurements of lymphedema: the BEI and SCDR. In total, 1920 images of 30 lymphedema patients were assigned to a training dataset (65%), validation dataset (15%), and test dataset (20%). The accuracy and MeanBFScore of the SegNet-based fibrosis segmentation were 0.776 and 0.868, respectively. The 4 calculated indices showed a significant strength of correlation (0.420–0.875) with the BEI in patients with chronic moderate-to-severe lymphedema. Among the 4 calculated formulae, the subtraction-type formula is the most promising for this estimation and could act as a foundation for development of automatic recognition systems for fibrotic changes resulting from various inflammation-provoking diseases, such as cellulitis and generalized edema67. Such systems would use cross-sectional CT images, leading to a greater chance of early detection with standardized classification in the future.","Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Evidence from “big data” for the default-mode hypothesis of ADHD: a mega-analysis of multiple large samples,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41386-022-01408-z,13 Sept 2022,"We sought to identify resting-state characteristics related to attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, both as a categorical diagnosis and as a trait feature, using large-scale samples which were processed according to a standardized pipeline. In categorical analyses, we considered 1301 subjects with diagnosed ADHD, contrasted against 1301 unaffected controls (total N = 2602; 1710 males (65.72%); mean age = 10.86 years, sd = 2.05). Cases and controls were 1:1 nearest neighbor matched on in-scanner motion and key demographic variables and drawn from multiple large cohorts. Associations between ADHD-traits and resting-state connectivity were also assessed in a large multi-cohort sample (N = 10,113). ADHD diagnosis was associated with less anticorrelation between the default mode and salience/ventral attention (B = 0.009, t = 3.45, p-FDR = 0.004, d = 0.14, 95% CI = 0.004, 0.014), somatomotor (B = 0.008, t = 3.49, p-FDR = 0.004, d = 0.14, 95% CI = 0.004, 0.013), and dorsal attention networks (B = 0.01, t = 4.28, p-FDR < 0.001, d = 0.17, 95% CI = 0.006, 0.015). These results were robust to sensitivity analyses considering comorbid internalizing problems, externalizing problems and psychostimulant medication. Similar findings were observed when examining ADHD traits, with the largest effect size observed for connectivity between the default mode network and the dorsal attention network (B = 0.0006, t = 5.57, p-FDR < 0.001, partial-r = 0.06, 95% CI = 0.0004, 0.0008). We report significant ADHD-related differences in interactions between the default mode network and task-positive networks, in line with default mode interference models of ADHD. Effect sizes (Cohen’s d and partial-r, estimated from the mega-analytic models) were small, indicating subtle group differences.

In vivo tumor immune microenvironment phenotypes correlate with inflammation and vasculature to predict immunotherapy response,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-32738-7,09 Sept 2022,"Response to immunotherapies can be variable and unpredictable. Pathology-based phenotyping of tumors into ‘hot’ and ‘cold’ is static, relying solely on T-cell infiltration in single-time single-site biopsies, resulting in suboptimal treatment response prediction. Dynamic vascular events (tumor angiogenesis, leukocyte trafficking) within tumor immune microenvironment (TiME) also influence anti-tumor immunity and treatment response. Here, we report dynamic cellular-level TiME phenotyping in vivo that combines inflammation profiles with vascular features through non-invasive reflectance confocal microscopic imaging. In skin cancer patients, we demonstrate three main TiME phenotypes that correlate with gene and protein expression, and response to toll-like receptor agonist immune-therapy. Notably, phenotypes with high inflammation associate with immunostimulatory signatures and those with high vasculature with angiogenic and endothelial anergy signatures. Moreover, phenotypes with high inflammation and low vasculature demonstrate the best treatment response. This non-invasive in vivo phenotyping approach integrating dynamic vasculature with inflammation serves as a reliable predictor of response to topical immune-therapy in patients.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: evasion; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Identifying patterns in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis progression from sparse longitudinal data,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43588-022-00299-w,08 Sept 2022,"The clinical presentation of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a fatal neurodegenerative disease, varies widely across patients, making it challenging to determine if potential therapeutics slow progression. We sought to determine whether there were common patterns of disease progression that could aid in the design and analysis of clinical trials. We developed an approach based on a mixture of Gaussian processes to identify clusters of patients sharing similar disease progression patterns, modeling their average trajectories and the variability in each cluster. We show that ALS progression is frequently nonlinear, with periods of stable disease preceded or followed by rapid decline. We also show that our approach can be extended to Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. Our results advance the characterization of disease progression of ALS and provide a flexible modeling approach that can be applied to other progressive diseases.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Genome-wide association analyses of physical activity and sedentary behavior provide insights into underlying mechanisms and roles in disease prevention,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-022-01165-1,07 Sept 2022,"Although physical activity and sedentary behavior are moderately heritable, little is known about the mechanisms that influence these traits. Combining data for up to 703,901 individuals from 51 studies in a multi-ancestry meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies yields 99 loci that associate with self-reported moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity during leisure time (MVPA), leisure screen time (LST) and/or sedentary behavior at work. Loci associated with LST are enriched for genes whose expression in skeletal muscle is altered by resistance training. A missense variant in ACTN3 makes the alpha-actinin-3 filaments more flexible, resulting in lower maximal force in isolated type IIA muscle fibers, and possibly protection from exercise-induced muscle damage. Finally, Mendelian randomization analyses show that beneficial effects of lower LST and higher MVPA on several risk factors and diseases are mediated or confounded by body mass index (BMI). Our results provide insights into physical activity mechanisms and its role in disease prevention.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: ; Attacker Capability: 
Validation of an overnight wireless high-resolution oximeter for the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea at home,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-17698-8,07 Sept 2022,"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is extremely common and has several consequences. However, most cases remain undiagnosed. One limitation is the lack of simple and validated methods for OSA diagnosis at home. The aim of this study was to validate a wireless high-resolution oximeter with a built-in accelerometer linked to a smartphone with automated cloud analysis (Biologix) that was compared with a home sleep test (HST, Apnea Link Air) performed on the same night. We recruited 670 patients out of a task force of 1013 patients with suspected OSA who were referred to our center for diagnosis. The final sample consisted of 478 patients (mean age: 56.7 ± 13.1 years, mean body mass index: 31.9 ± 6.3 kg/m2). To estimate the night-to-night OSA severity variability, 62 patients underwent HST for two consecutive nights. The HST-apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) and the Biologix-oxygen desaturation index (ODI) was 25.0 ± 25.0 events/h and 24.9 ± 26.5 events/h, respectively. The area under the curve—sensibility/specificity to detect at least mild (HST-AHI > 5), moderate-to-severe (HST-AHI > 15), and severe OSA (HST-AHI > 30) were (0.983)—94.7/92.8, (0.986)—94.8/93.9, and (0.990)—95.8/94.3, respectively. The limits of agreement originating from the Bland–Altman plot and the correlation between HST-AHI and Biologix-ODI were lower than the night-to-night HST-AHI variability (25.5 and 34.5 events/h, respectively, p = 0.001). We conclude that Biologix is a simple and reliable technique for OSA diagnosis at home.",Conclusions not available,Gen AI,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Performance of a novel risk model for deep sternal wound infection after coronary artery bypass grafting,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-19473-1,07 Sept 2022,"Clinical prediction models for deep sternal wound infections (DSWI) after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery exist, although they have a poor impact in external validation studies. We developed and validated a new predictive model for 30-day DSWI after CABG (REPINF) and compared it with the Society of Thoracic Surgeons model (STS). The REPINF model was created through a multicenter cohort of adults undergoing CABG surgery (REPLICCAR II Study) database, using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression, internally and externally validated comparing discrimination, calibration in-the-large (CL), net reclassification improvement (NRI) and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI), trained between the new model and the STS PredDeep, a validated model for DSWI after cardiac surgery. In the validation data, c-index = 0.83 (95% CI 0.72–0.95). Compared to the STS PredDeep, predictions improved by 6.5% (IDI). However, both STS and REPINF had limited calibration. Different populations require independent scoring systems to achieve the best predictive effect. The external validation of REPINF across multiple centers is an important quality improvement tool to generalize the model and to guide healthcare professionals in the prevention of DSWI after CABG surgery.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
High-dimensional multinomial multiclass severity scoring of COVID-19 pneumonia using CT radiomics features and machine learning algorithms,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-18994-z,01 Sept 2022,"We aimed to construct a prediction model based on computed tomography (CT) radiomics features to classify COVID-19 patients into severe-, moderate-, mild-, and non-pneumonic. A total of 1110 patients were studied from a publicly available dataset with 4-class severity scoring performed by a radiologist (based on CT images and clinical features). The entire lungs were segmented and followed by resizing, bin discretization and radiomic features extraction. We utilized two feature selection algorithms, namely bagging random forest (BRF) and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), each coupled to a classifier, namely multinomial logistic regression (MLR), to construct multiclass classification models. The dataset was divided into 50% (555 samples), 20% (223 samples), and 30% (332 samples) for training, validation, and untouched test datasets, respectively. Subsequently, nested cross-validation was performed on train/validation to select the features and tune the models. All predictive power indices were reported based on the testing set. The performance of multi-class models was assessed using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy based on the 4 × 4 confusion matrices. In addition, the areas under the receiver operating characteristic  curves (AUCs) for multi-class classifications were calculated and compared for both models. Using BRF, 23 radiomic features were selected, 11 from first-order, 9 from GLCM, 1 GLRLM, 1 from GLDM, and 1 from shape. Ten features were selected using the MARS algorithm, namely 3 from first-order, 1 from GLDM, 1 from GLRLM, 1 from GLSZM, 1 from shape, and 3 from GLCM features. The mean absolute deviation, skewness, and variance from first-order and flatness from shape, and cluster prominence from GLCM features and Gray Level Non Uniformity Normalize from GLRLM were selected by both BRF and MARS algorithms. All selected features by BRF or MARS were significantly associated with four-class outcomes as assessed within MLR (All p values < 0.05). BRF + MLR and MARS + MLR resulted in pseudo-R2 prediction performances of 0.305 and 0.253, respectively. Meanwhile, there was a significant difference between the feature selection models when using a likelihood ratio test (p value = 0.046). Based on confusion matrices for BRF + MLR and MARS + MLR algorithms, the precision was 0.856 and 0.728, the recall was 0.852 and 0.722, whereas the accuracy was 0.921 and 0.861, respectively. AUCs (95% CI) for multi-class classification were 0.846 (0.805–0.887) and 0.807 (0.752–0.861) for BRF + MLR and MARS + MLR algorithms, respectively. Our models based on the utilization of radiomic features, coupled with machine learning were able to accurately classify patients according to the severity of pneumonia, thus highlighting the potential of this emerging paradigm in the prognostication and management of COVID-19 patients.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Breast cancer detection by analyzing the volatile organic compound (VOC) signature in human urine,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-17795-8,01 Sept 2022,"A rising number of authors are drawing evidence on the diagnostic capacity of specific volatile organic compounds (VOCs) resulting from some body fluids. While cancer incidence in society is on the rise, it becomes clear that the analysis of these VOCs can yield new strategies to mitigate advanced cancer incidence rates. This paper presents the methodology implemented to test whether a device consisting of an electronic nose inspired by a dog’s olfactory system and olfactory neurons is significantly informative to detect breast cancer (BC). To test this device, 90 human urine samples were collected from control subjects and BC patients at a hospital. To test this system, an artificial intelligence-based classification algorithm was developed. The algorithm was firstly trained and tested with data resulting from gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS) urine readings, leading to a classification rate of 92.31%, sensitivity of 100.00%, and specificity of 85.71% (N = 90). Secondly, the same algorithm was trained and tested with data obtained with our eNose prototype hardware, and class prediction was achieved with a classification rate of 75%, sensitivity of 100%, and specificity of 50%.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Machine learning-based automatic estimation of cortical atrophy using brain computed tomography images,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-18696-6,30 Aug 2022,"Cortical atrophy is measured clinically according to established visual rating scales based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Although brain MRI is the primary imaging marker for neurodegeneration, computed tomography (CT) is also widely used for the early detection and diagnosis of dementia. However, they are seldom investigated. Therefore, we developed a machine learning algorithm for the automatic estimation of cortical atrophy on brain CT. Brain CT images (259 Alzheimer’s dementia and 55 cognitively normal subjects) were visually rated by three neurologists and used for training. We constructed an algorithm by combining the convolutional neural network and regularized logistic regression (RLR). Model performance was then compared with that of neurologists, and feature importance was measured. RLR provided fast and reliable automatic estimations of frontal atrophy (75.2% accuracy, 93.6% sensitivity, 67.2% specificity, and 0.87 area under the curve [AUC]), posterior atrophy (79.6% accuracy, 87.2% sensitivity, 75.9% specificity, and 0.88 AUC), right medial temporal atrophy (81.2% accuracy, 84.7% sensitivity, 79.6% specificity, and 0.88 AUC), and left medial temporal atrophy (77.7% accuracy, 91.1% sensitivity, 72.3% specificity, and 0.90 AUC).

Semi-supervised classifier guided by discriminator,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-18947-6,29 Aug 2022,"Some machine learning applications do not allow for data augmentation or are applied to modalities where the augmentation is difficult to define. Our study aimed to develop a new method in semi-supervised learning (SSL) applicable to various modalities of data (images, sound, text), especially when augmentation is hard or impossible to define, i.e., medical images. Assuming that all samples, labeled and unlabeled, come from the same data distribution, we can say that labeled and unlabeled data sets used in the semi-supervised learning tasks are similar. Based on this observation, the data embeddings created by the classifier should also be similar for both sets. In our method, finding these embeddings is achieved based on two models—classifier and an auxiliary discriminator model, inspired by the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) learning process. The classifier is trained to build embeddings for labeled and unlabeled datasets to cheat discriminator, which recognizes whether the embedding comes from a labeled or unlabeled dataset. The method was named the DGSSC from Discriminator Guided Semi-Supervised Classifier. The experimental research aimed evaluation of the proposed method on the classification task in combination with the teacher-student approach and comparison with other SSL methods. In most experiments, training the networks with the DGSSC method improves accuracy with the teacher-student approach.

The aim of this study was to investigate a predictive power for predicting ACS using the machine learning-based prehospital algorithm. We conducted a multicenter observational prospective study that included 10 participating facilities in an urban area of Japan. The data from consecutive adult patients, identified by emergency medical service personnel with suspected ACS, were analyzed. In this study, we used nested cross-validation to evaluate the predictive performance of the model.

Here, we established the concurrent validity and test–retest reliability of accelerations and orientations measured using affordable novel sensors during squats, jumps, walking and stair ambulation. In this observational study, participants underwent three data collection sessions during one day. Accelerations and orientations from sacrum, thigh and shank were collected using these sensors and already validated gold-standard sensors as the criterion method. We assessed validity by comparing the similarity of signal waveforms with the Linear Fit Method and by comparing mean differences in range values with the Bland–Altman plots. Reliability was assessed by calculating interclass correlation coefficient and standard error of measurements of the range values. Concurrent validity was from fair to excellent in 91% of the cases for accelerations and in 84.4% for orientations. Test–retest reliability of accelerations was from fair to excellent in 97% of cases when the sensors were attached by a researcher, and in 84.4% of cases when the sensors were attached by participants. Test–retest reliability of orientations was from fair to excellent in 88.9% of cases when the sensors were attached by a researcher, and in 68.9% of cases when the sensors were attached by participants. In conclusion, the new affordable sensors provide accurate measures of accelerations and orientations during multiple functional activities in healthy adults. Reliability of the orientations may depend on the ability to replicate the same position of the sensor under test–retest conditions.",Conclusions not available,Gen AI,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Its performance is somewhat comparable to the phenotype method-based Symptom Similarity Score, 63.7% vs. 100%, but LeMeDISCO works for far more cases and its large comorbidity recall is attributed to shared proteins that can help provide an understanding of the molecular mechanism(s) underlying disease comorbidity.

Network phenotypes and their clinical significance in temporal lobe epilepsy using machine learning applications to morphological and functional graph theory metrics,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-18495-z,24 Aug 2022,"Machine learning analyses were performed on graph theory (GT) metrics extracted from brain functional and morphological data from temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients in order to identify intrinsic network phenotypes and characterize their clinical significance. Participants were 97 TLE and 36 healthy controls from the Epilepsy Connectome Project. Each imaging modality (i.e., Resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (RS-fMRI), and structural MRI) rendered 2 clusters: one comparable to controls and one deviating from controls. Participants were minimally overlapping across the identified clusters, suggesting that an abnormal functional GT phenotype did not necessarily mean an abnormal morphological GT phenotype for the same subject. Morphological clusters were associated with a significant difference in the estimated lifetime number of generalized tonic–clonic seizures and functional cluster membership was associated with age. Furthermore, controls exhibited significant correlations between functional GT metrics and cognition, while for TLE participants morphological GT metrics were linked to cognition, suggesting a dissociation between higher cognitive abilities and GT-derived network measures. Overall, these findings demonstrate the existence of clinically meaningful minimally overlapping phenotypes of morphological and functional GT networks. Functional network properties may underlie variance in cognition in healthy brains, but in the pathological state of epilepsy the cognitive limits might be primarily related to structural cerebral network properties.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Brain–phenotype models fail for individuals who defy sample stereotypes,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05118-w,24 Aug 2022,"Individual differences in brain functional organization track a range of traits, symptoms and behaviours1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12. So far, work modelling linear brain–phenotype relationships has assumed that a single such relationship generalizes across all individuals, but models do not work equally well in all participants13,14. A better understanding of in whom models fail and why is crucial to revealing robust, useful and unbiased brain–phenotype relationships. To this end, here we related brain activity to phenotype using predictive models—trained and tested on independent data to ensure generalizability15—and examined model failure. We applied this data-driven approach to a range of neurocognitive measures in a new, clinically and demographically heterogeneous dataset, with the results replicated in two independent, publicly available datasets16,17. Across all three datasets, we find that models reflect not unitary cognitive constructs, but rather neurocognitive scores intertwined with sociodemographic and clinical covariates; that is, models reflect stereotypical profiles, and fail when applied to individuals who defy them. Model failure is reliable, phenotype specific and generalizable across datasets. Together, these results highlight the pitfalls of a one-size-fits-all modelling approach and the effect of biased phenotypic measures18,19,20 on the interpretation and utility of resulting brain–phenotype models.

Evaluating the performance of Bayesian and frequentist approaches for longitudinal modeling: application to Alzheimer’s disease,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-18129-4,24 Aug 2022,"Linear mixed effects (LME) modelling under both frequentist and Bayesian frameworks can be used to study longitudinal trajectories. We studied the performance of both frameworks on different dataset configurations using hippocampal volumes from longitudinal MRI data across groups—healthy controls (HC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients, including subjects that converted from MCI to AD. We started from a big database of 1250 subjects from the Alzheimer’s disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI), and we created different reduced datasets simulating real-life situations using a random-removal permutation-based approach. The number of subjects needed to differentiate groups and to detect conversion to AD was 147 and 115 respectively. The Bayesian approach allowed estimating the LME model even with very sparse databases, with high number of missing points, which was not possible with the frequentist approach. Our results indicate that the frequentist approach is computationally simpler, but it fails in modelling data with high number of missing values.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Identification of key microRNAs as predictive biomarkers of Nilotinib response in chronic myeloid leukemia: a sub-analysis of the ENESTxtnd clinical trial,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41375-022-01680-4,23 Aug 2022,"Despite the effectiveness of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) against chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), they are not usually curative as some patients develop drug-resistance or are at risk of disease relapse when treatment is discontinued. Studies have demonstrated that primitive CML cells display unique miRNA profiles in response to TKI treatment. However, the utility of miRNAs in predicting treatment response is not yet conclusive. Here, we analyzed differentially expressed miRNAs in CD34+ CML cells pre- and post-nilotinib (NL) therapy from 58 patients enrolled in the Canadian sub-analysis of the ENESTxtnd phase IIIb clinical trial which correlated with sensitivity of CD34+ cells to NL treatment in in vitro colony-forming cell (CFC) assays. We performed Cox Proportional Hazard (CoxPH) analysis and applied machine learning algorithms to generate multivariate miRNA panels which can predict NL response at treatment-naïve or post-treatment time points. We demonstrated that a combination of miR-145 and miR-708 are effective predictors of NL response in treatment-naïve patients whereas miR-150 and miR-185 were significant classifiers at 1-month and 3-month post-NL therapy. Interestingly, incorporation of NL-CFC output in these panels enhanced predictive performance. Thus, this novel predictive model may be developed into a prognostic tool for use in the clinic.",Conclusions not available,,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Feasibility of anomaly score detected with deep learning in irradiated breast cancer patients with reconstruction,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-022-00671-0,23 Aug 2022,"The aim of this study is to evaluate cosmetic outcomes of the reconstructed breast in breast cancer patients, using anomaly score (AS) detected by generative adversarial network (GAN) deep learning algorithm. A total of 251 normal breast images from patients who underwent breast-conserving surgery were used for training anomaly GAN network. GAN-based anomaly detection was used to calculate abnormalities as an AS, followed by standardization by using z-score. Then, we reviewed 61 breast cancer patients who underwent mastectomy followed by reconstruction with autologous tissue or tissue expander. All patients were treated with adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) after reconstruction and computed tomography (CT) was performed at three-time points with a regular follow-up; before RT (Pre-RT), one year after RT (Post-1Y), and two years after RT (Post-2Y). Compared to Pre-RT, Post-1Y and Post-2Y demonstrated higher AS, indicating more abnormal cosmetic outcomes (Pre-RT vs. Post-1Y, P = 0.015 and Pre-RT vs. Post-2Y, P = 0.011). Pre-RT AS was higher in patients having major breast complications (P = 0.016). Patients with autologous reconstruction showed lower AS than those with tissue expander both at Pre-RT (2.00 vs. 4.19, P = 0.008) and Post-2Y (2.89 vs. 5.00, P = 0.010). Linear mixed effect model revealed that days after baseline were associated with increased AS (P = 0.007). Also, tissue expander was associated with steeper rise of AS, compared to autologous tissue (P = 0.015). Fractionation regimen was not associated with the change of AS (P = 0.389). AS detected by deep learning might be feasible in predicting cosmetic outcomes of RT-treated patients with breast reconstruction. AS should be validated in prospective studies.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Impact of individual and treatment characteristics on wearable sensor-based digital biomarkers of opioid use,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-022-00664-z,22 Aug 2022,"Opioid use disorder is one of the most pressing public health problems of our time. Mobile health tools, including wearable sensors, have great potential in this space, but have been underutilized. Of specific interest are digital biomarkers, or end-user generated physiologic or behavioral measurements that correlate with health or pathology. The current manuscript describes a longitudinal, observational study of adult patients receiving opioid analgesics for acute painful conditions. Participants in the study are monitored with a wrist-worn E4 sensor, during which time physiologic parameters (heart rate/variability, electrodermal activity, skin temperature, and accelerometry) are collected continuously. Opioid use events are recorded via electronic medical record and self-report. Three-hundred thirty-nine discreet dose opioid events from 36 participant are analyzed among 2070 h of sensor data. Fifty-one features are extracted from the data and initially compared pre- and post-opioid administration, and subsequently are used to generate machine learning models. Model performance is compared based on individual and treatment characteristics. The best performing machine learning model to detect opioid administration is a Channel-Temporal Attention-Temporal Convolutional Network (CTA-TCN) model using raw data from the wearable sensor. History of intravenous drug use is associated with better model performance, while middle age, and co-administration of non-narcotic analgesia or sedative drugs are associated with worse model performance. These characteristics may be candidate input features for future opioid detection model iterations. Once mature, this technology could provide clinicians with actionable data on opioid use patterns in real-world settings, and predictive analytics for early identification of opioid use disorder risk.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Comparison of the modified Singapore myocardial infarction registry risk score with GRACE 2.0 in predicting 1-year acute myocardial infarction outcomes,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-16523-6,22 Aug 2022,"Risk stratification plays a key role in identifying acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients at higher risk of mortality. However, current AMI risk scores such as the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) score were derived from predominantly Caucasian populations and may not be applicable to Asian populations. We previously developed an AMI risk score from the national-level Singapore Myocardial Infarction Registry (SMIR) confined to ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients and did not include non-STEMI (NSTEMI) patients. Here, we derived a modified SMIR risk score for both STEMI and NSTEMI patients and compared its performance to the GRACE 2.0 score for predicting 1-year all-cause mortality in our multi-ethnic population. The most significant predictor of 1-year all-cause mortality in our population using the GRACE 2.0 score was cardiopulmonary resuscitation on admission (adjusted hazards ratio [HR] 6.50), while the most significant predictor using the SMIR score was age 80–89 years (adjusted HR 7.78). Although the variables used in the GRACE 2.0 score and SMIR score were not exactly the same, the c-statistics for 1-year all-cause mortality were similar between the two scores (GRACE 2.0 0.841 and SMIR 0.865). In conclusion, we have shown that in a multi-ethnic Asian AMI population undergoing PCI, the SMIR score performed as well as the GRACE 2.0 score.",Conclusions not available,Traditional ML,"Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient, healthcare practitioner; Attacker Capability: "
Generation of realistic synthetic data using Multimodal Neural Ordinary Differential Equations,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-022-00666-x,20 Aug 2022,"Individual organizations, such as hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, and health insurance providers, are currently limited in their ability to collect data that are fully representative of a disease population. This can, in turn, negatively impact the generalization ability of statistical models and scientific insights. However, sharing data across different organizations is highly restricted by legal regulations. While federated data access concepts exist, they are technically and organizationally difficult to realize. An alternative approach would be to exchange synthetic patient data instead. In this work, we introduce the Multimodal Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (MultiNODEs), a hybrid, multimodal AI approach, which allows for generating highly realistic synthetic patient trajectories on a continuous time scale, hence enabling smooth interpolation and extrapolation of clinical studies. Our proposed method can integrate both static and longitudinal data, and implicitly handles missing values. We demonstrate the capabilities of MultiNODEs by applying them to real patient-level data from two independent clinical studies and simulated epidemiological data of an infectious disease.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Prediction of mortality risk of health checkup participants using machine learning-based models: the J-SHC study,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-18276-8,19 Aug 2022,"Early detection and treatment of diseases through health checkups are effective in improving life expectancy. In this study, we compared the predictive ability for 5-year mortality between two machine learning-based models (gradient boosting decision tree [XGBoost] and neural network) and a conventional logistic regression model in 116,749 health checkup participants. We built prediction models using a training dataset consisting of 85,361 participants in 2008 and evaluated the models using a test dataset consisting of 31,388 participants from 2009 to 2014. The predictive ability was evaluated by the values of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in the test dataset. The AUC values were 0.811 for XGBoost, 0.774 for neural network, and 0.772 for logistic regression models, indicating that the predictive ability of XGBoost was the highest. The importance rating of each explanatory variable was evaluated using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values, which were similar among these models. This study showed that the machine learning-based model has a higher predictive ability than the conventional logistic regression model and may be useful for risk assessment and health guidance for health checkup participants.","This study showed that the machine learning method XGBoost has a higher predictive ability for mortality than conventional logistic regression, using the same standardized checkup items. This indicates that machine learning may be helpful for the risk assessment of health checkup participants and the improvement of health checkup programs.

Predicting response to immunotherapy in gastric cancer via multi-dimensional analyses of the tumour immune microenvironment,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-32570-z,18 Aug 2022,"A single biomarker is not adequate to identify patients with gastric cancer (GC) who have the potential to benefit from anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy, presumably owing to the complexity of the tumour microenvironment. The predictive value of tumour-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs) has not been definitively established with regard to their density and spatial organisation. Here, multiplex immunohistochemistry is used to quantify in situ biomarkers at sub-cellular resolution in 80 patients with GC. To predict the response to immunotherapy, we establish a multi-dimensional TIIC signature by considering the density of CD4+FoxP3−PD-L1+, CD8+PD-1−LAG3−, and CD68+STING+ cells and the spatial organisation of CD8+PD-1+LAG3− T cells. The TIIC signature enables prediction of the response of patients with GC to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy and patient survival. Our findings demonstrate that a multi-dimensional TIIC signature may be relevant for the selection of patients who could benefit the most from anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: evasion; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
DenseUNets with feedback non-local attention for the segmentation of specular microscopy images of the corneal endothelium with guttae,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-18180-1,18 Aug 2022,"Corneal guttae, which are the abnormal growth of extracellular matrix in the corneal endothelium, are observed in specular images as black droplets that occlude the endothelial cells. To estimate the corneal parameters (endothelial cell density [ECD], coefficient of variation [CV], and hexagonality [HEX]), we propose a new deep learning method that includes a novel attention mechanism (named fNLA), which helps to infer the cell edges in the occluded areas. The approach first derives the cell edges, then infers the well-detected cells, and finally employs a postprocessing method to fix mistakes. This results in a binary segmentation from which the corneal parameters are estimated. We analyzed 1203 images (500 contained guttae) obtained with a Topcon SP-1P microscope. To generate the ground truth, we performed manual segmentation in all images. Several networks were evaluated (UNet, ResUNeXt, DenseUNets, UNet++, etc.) and we found that DenseUNets with fNLA provided the lowest error: a mean absolute error of 23.16 [cells/mm\(^{2}\)] in ECD, 1.28 [%] in CV, and 3.13 [%] in HEX. Compared with Topcon’s built-in software, our error was 3–6 times smaller. Overall, our approach handled notably well the cells affected by guttae, detecting cell edges partially occluded by small guttae and discarding large areas covered by extensive guttae.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

We also identified the characteristics of poor responders to anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injections. Aqueous inflammatory cytokine and VEGF concentrations were significantly higher in major BRVO. In optical coherence tomography, major BRVO had a higher proportion with subretinal fluid, disorganization of retinal inner layers, and ellipsoid zone disruption. Comparing the clinical outcomes, major BRVO required more intravitreal anti-VEGF injections and had a poorer visual prognosis in the first 12 months. A significantly higher proportion of patients with major BRVO required additional treatments after 6 months compared to macular BRVO. Patients who responded poorly to anti-VEGF had higher aqueous VEGF levels and central subfield thickness (CST) at baseline. In conclusion, major BRVO patients required more and longer treatments, and had worse visual prognoses. BRVO that responds poorly to anti-VEGF had greater CST and higher aqueous VEGF levels at baseline.",Conclusions not available,Gen AI,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Binary dose level classification of tumour microvascular response to radiotherapy using artificial intelligence analysis of optical coherence tomography images,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-18393-4,17 Aug 2022,"The dominant consequence of irradiating biological systems is cellular damage, yet microvascular damage begins to assume an increasingly important role as the radiation dose levels increase. This is currently becoming more relevant in radiation medicine with its pivot towards higher-dose-per-fraction/fewer fractions treatment paradigm (e.g., stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT)). We have thus developed a 3D preclinical imaging platform based on speckle-variance optical coherence tomography (svOCT) for longitudinal monitoring of tumour microvascular radiation responses in vivo. Here we present an artificial intelligence (AI) approach to analyze the resultant microvascular data. In this initial study, we show that AI can successfully classify SBRT-relevant clinical radiation dose levels at multiple timepoints (t = 2–4 weeks) following irradiation (10 Gy and 30 Gy cohorts) based on induced changes in the detected microvascular networks. Practicality of the obtained results, challenges associated with modest number of animals, their successful mitigation via augmented data approaches, and advantages of using 3D deep learning methodologies, are discussed. Extension of this encouraging initial study to longitudinal AI-based time-series analysis for treatment outcome predictions at finer dose level gradations is envisioned.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Lightweight Distributed Provenance Model for Complex Real–world Environments,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01537-6,17 Aug 2022,"Provenance is information describing the lineage of an object, such as a dataset or biological material. Since these objects can be passed between organizations, each organization can document only parts of the objects life cycle. As a result, interconnection of distributed provenance parts forms distributed provenance chains. Dependant on the actual provenance content, complete provenance chains can provide traceability and contribute to reproducibility and FAIRness of research objects. In this paper, we define a lightweight provenance model based on W3C PROV that enables generation of distributed provenance chains in complex, multi-organizational environments. The application of the model is demonstrated with a use case spanning several steps of a real-world research pipeline — starting with the acquisition of a specimen, its processing and storage, histological examination, and the generation/collection of associated data (images, annotations, clinical data), ending with training an AI model for the detection of tumor in the images.

A machine-vision-based frailty index for mice,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-022-00266-0,16 Aug 2022,"Heterogeneity in biological aging manifests itself in health status and mortality. Frailty indices (FIs) capture health status in humans and model organisms. To accelerate our understanding of biological aging and carry out scalable interventional studies, high-throughput approaches are necessary. Here we introduce a machine-learning-based visual FI for mice that operates on video data from an open-field assay. We use machine vision to extract morphometric, gait and other behavioral features that correlate with FI score and age. We use these features to train a regression model that accurately predicts the normalized FI score within 0.04 ± 0.002 (mean absolute error). Unnormalized, this error is 1.08 ± 0.05, which is comparable to one FI item being mis-scored by 1 point or two FI items mis-scored by 0.5 points. This visual FI provides increased reproducibility and scalability that will enable large-scale mechanistic and interventional studies of aging in mice.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: ; Attacker Capability: 
A systems approach towards remote health-monitoring in older adults: Introducing a zero-interaction digital exhaust,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-022-00657-y,16 Aug 2022,"Using connected sensing devices to remotely monitor health is a promising way to help transition healthcare from a rather reactive to a more precision medicine oriented proactive approach, which could be particularly relevant in the face of rapid population ageing and the challenges it poses to healthcare systems. Sensor derived digital measures of health, such as digital biomarkers or digital clinical outcome assessments, may be used to monitor health status or the risk of adverse events like falls. Current research around such digital measures has largely focused on exploring the use of few individual measures obtained through mobile devices. However, especially for long-term applications in older adults, this choice of technology may not be ideal and could further add to the digital divide. Moreover, large-scale systems biology approaches, like genomics, have already proven beneficial in precision medicine, making it plausible that the same could also hold for remote-health monitoring. In this context, we introduce and describe a zero-interaction digital exhaust: a set of 1268 digital measures that cover large parts of a person’s activity, behavior and physiology. Making this approach more inclusive of older adults, we base this set entirely on contactless, zero-interaction sensing technologies. Applying the resulting digital exhaust to real-world data, we then demonstrate the possibility to create multiple ageing relevant digital clinical outcome assessments. Paired with modern machine learning, we find these assessments to be surprisingly powerful and often on-par with mobile approaches. Lastly, we highlight the possibility to discover novel digital biomarkers based on this large-scale approach.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Non-invasive monitoring of blood oxygenation in human placentas via concurrent diffuse optical spectroscopy and ultrasound imaging,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-022-00913-2,15 Aug 2022,"Direct assessment of blood oxygenation in the human placenta can provide information about placental function. However, the monitoring of placental oxygenation involves invasive sampling or imaging techniques that are poorly suited for bedside use. Here we show that placental oxygen haemodynamics can be non-invasively probed in real time and up to 4.2 cm below the body surface via concurrent frequency-domain diffuse optical spectroscopy and ultrasound imaging. We developed a multimodal instrument to facilitate the assessment of the properties of the anterior placenta by leveraging image-reconstruction algorithms that integrate ultrasound information about the morphology of tissue layers with optical information on haemodynamics. In a pilot investigation involving placentas with normal function (15 women) or abnormal function (9 women) from pregnancies in the third trimester, we found no significant differences in baseline haemoglobin properties, but statistically significant differences in the haemodynamic responses to maternal hyperoxia. Our findings suggest that the non-invasive monitoring of placental oxygenation may aid the early detection of placenta-related adverse pregnancy outcomes and maternal vascular malperfusion.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
KBG syndrome: videoconferencing and use of artificial intelligence driven facial phenotyping in 25 new patients,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41431-022-01171-1,15 Aug 2022,"Genetic variants in Ankyrin Repeat Domain 11 (ANKRD11) and deletions in 16q24.3 are known to cause KBG syndrome, a rare syndrome associated with craniofacial, intellectual, and neurobehavioral anomalies. We report 25 unpublished individuals from 22 families with molecularly confirmed diagnoses. Twelve individuals have de novo variants, three have inherited variants, and one is inherited from a parent with low-level mosaicism. The mode of inheritance was unknown for nine individuals. Twenty are truncating variants, and the remaining five are missense (three of which are found in one family). We present a protocol emphasizing the use of videoconference and artificial intelligence (AI) in collecting and analyzing data for this rare syndrome. A single clinician interviewed 25 individuals throughout eight countries. Participants’ medical records were reviewed, and data was uploaded to the Human Disease Gene website using Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms. Photos of the participants were analyzed by the GestaltMatcher and DeepGestalt, Face2Gene platform (FDNA Inc, USA) algorithms. Within our cohort, common traits included short stature, macrodontia, anteverted nares, wide nasal bridge, wide nasal base, thick eyebrows, synophrys and hypertelorism. Behavioral issues and global developmental delays were widely present. Neurologic abnormalities including seizures and/or EEG abnormalities were common (44%), suggesting that early detection and seizure prophylaxis could be an important point of intervention. Almost a quarter (24%) were diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and 28% were diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. Based on the data, we provide a set of recommendations regarding diagnostic and treatment approaches for KBG syndrome.","Early intervention with physical, occupational, and speech therapies is recommended. Anecdotal reports from families indicate that a frequency of at least once weekly is likely ideal. Children with ANKRD11 variants should undergo baseline auditory screening to rule out hearing defects that might impede speech development.


There is evidence for the utility of growth hormone treatment for those with short stature (under their target range). Systematic study is required for formal guidelines and recommendations.




High rates of seizures point at the possible utility of EEG screening upon diagnosis with regular monitoring by a neurologist. Further research is warranted to justify EEG screening, though other rare diseases with a high prevalence of seizures do have formal recommendations for baseline EEG screening, such as Tuberous Sclerosis [32].


Patients may benefit from cardiac screening (including echocardiography) upon diagnosis.


Chronic otitis media with hearing loss is a frequent finding. More research is needed to investigate whether aggressive antibiotic treatment could prevent hearing loss.


Future research and clinical efforts should include more study of GI symptoms (e.g. abdominal migraines) due to their increased prevalence.


Artificial intelligence-assisted facial applications can play a role in reducing missed diagnoses, given the often mild cognitive deficits and subtle dysmorphic features of KBG syndrome.

While there are many promising clinical applications for OCTA, determination of image quality remains a challenge. We developed a deep learning-based system using a ResNet152 neural network classifier, pretrained using ImageNet, to classify images of the superficial capillary plexus in 347 scans from 134 patients. Images were also manually graded by two independent graders as a ground truth for the supervised learning models. Because requirements for image quality may vary depending on the clinical or research setting, two models were trained—one to identify high-quality images and one to identify low-quality images. Our neural network models demonstrated outstanding area under the curve (AUC) metrics for both low quality image identification (AUC = 0.99, 95%CI 0.98–1.00, \(\kappa \) = 0.90) and high quality image identification (AUC =  0.97, 95%CI 0.96–0.99, \(\kappa \) = 0.81), significantly outperforming machine-reported signal strength (AUC = 0.82, 95%CI 0.77–0.86, \(\kappa \)= 0.52 and AUC = 0.78, 95%CI 0.73–0.83, \(\kappa \) = 0.27 respectively).

This work aimed to study its prognostic factors for risk mitigation by means of care management and planning. A database of 380,919 surgeries was reviewed, and 150 POCAs were curated. The main outcome was mortality prior to hospital discharge. Patient demographic, medical history, and clinical characteristics (anesthesia and surgery) were the main features. Six machine learning (ML) algorithms, including LR, SVC, RF, GBM, AdaBoost, and VotingClassifier, were explored. The last algorithm was an ensemble of the first five algorithms. k-fold cross-validation and bootstrapping minimized the prediction bias and variance, respectively. Explainers (SHAP and LIME) were used to interpret the predictions. The ensemble provided the most accurate and robust predictions (AUC = 0.90 [95% CI, 0.78–0.98]) across various age groups. The risk factors were identified by order of importance. Surprisingly, the comorbidity of hypertension was found to have a protective effect on survival, which was reported by a recent study for the first time to our knowledge. The validated ensemble classifier in aid of the explainers improved the predictive differentiation, thereby deepening our understanding of POCA prognostication.

Testing the applicability and performance of Auto ML for potential applications in diagnostic neuroradiology,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-18028-8,11 Aug 2022,"To investigate the applicability and performance of automated machine learning (AutoML) for potential applications in diagnostic neuroradiology. In the medical sector, there is a rapidly growing demand for machine learning methods, but only a limited number of corresponding experts. The comparatively simple handling of AutoML should enable even non-experts to develop adequate machine learning models with manageable effort. We aim to investigate the feasibility as well as the advantages and disadvantages of developing AutoML models compared to developing conventional machine learning models. We discuss the results in relation to a concrete example of a medical prediction application. In this retrospective IRB-approved study, a cohort of 107 patients who underwent gross total meningioma resection and a second cohort of 31 patients who underwent subtotal resection were included. Image segmentation of the contrast enhancing parts of the tumor was performed semi-automatically using the open-source software platform 3D Slicer. A total of 107 radiomic features were extracted by hand-delineated regions of interest from the pre-treatment MRI images of each patient. Within the AutoML approach, 20 different machine learning algorithms were trained and tested simultaneously. For comparison, a neural network and different conventional machine learning algorithms were trained and tested. With respect to the exemplary medical prediction application used in this study to evaluate the performance of Auto ML, namely the pre-treatment prediction of the achievable resection status of meningioma, AutoML achieved remarkable performance nearly equivalent to that of a feed-forward neural network with a single hidden layer. However, in the clinical case study considered here, logistic regression outperformed the AutoML algorithm. Using independent test data, we observed the following classification results (AutoML/neural network/logistic regression): mean area under the curve = 0.849/0.879/0.900, mean accuracy = 0.821/0.839/0.881, mean kappa = 0.465/0.491/0.644, mean sensitivity = 0.578/0.577/0.692 and mean specificity = 0.891/0.914/0.936. The results obtained with AutoML are therefore very promising. However, the AutoML models in our study did not yet show the corresponding performance of the best models obtained with conventional machine learning methods.

Simple charts and hypothesis-driven statistics can no longer apprehend the content of information-rich clinical data. There is, therefore, a clear need for powerful interactive visualization tools enabling medical practitioners to perceive the patterns and insights gained by state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. Here, we report an interactive graphical interface for use as the front end of a machine learning causal inference server (MIIC), to facilitate the visualization and comprehension by clinicians of relationships between clinically relevant variables. The widespread use of such tools, facilitating the interactive exploration of datasets, is crucial both for data visualization and for the generation of research hypotheses. We demonstrate the utility of the MIIC interactive interface, by exploring the clinical network of a large cohort of breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). This example highlights, in particular, the direct and indirect links between post-NAC clinical responses and patient survival. The MIIC interactive graphical interface has the potential to help clinicians identify actionable nodes and edges in clinical networks, thereby ultimately improving the patient care pathway.",Conclusions not available,Gen AI,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Predicting liver regeneration following major resection,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-16968-9,04 Aug 2022,"Breakdown of synthesis, excretion and detoxification defines liver failure. Post-hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF) is specific for liver resection and a rightfully feared complication due to high lethality and limited therapeutic success. Individual cytokine and growth factor profiles may represent potent predictive markers for recovery of liver function. We aimed to investigate these profiles in post-hepatectomy regeneration. This study combined a time-dependent cytokine and growth factor profiling dataset of a training (30 patients) and a validation (14 patients) cohorts undergoing major liver resection with statistical and predictive models identifying individual pathway signatures. 2319 associations were tested. Primary hepatocytes isolated from patient tissue samples were stimulated and their proliferation was analysed through DNA content assay. Common expression trajectories of cytokines and growth factors with strong correlation to PHLF, morbidity and mortality were identified despite highly individual perioperative dynamics. Especially, dynamics of EGF, HGF, and PLGF were associated with mortality. PLGF was additionally associated with PHLF and complications. A global association-network was calculated and validated to investigate interdependence of cytokines and growth factors with clinical attributes. Preoperative cytokine and growth factor signatures were identified allowing prediction of mortality following major liver resection by regression modelling. Proliferation analysis of corresponding primary human hepatocytes showed associations of individual regenerative potential with clinical outcome. Prediction of PHLF was possible on as early as first postoperative day (POD1) with AUC above 0.75. Prediction of PHLF and mortality is possible on POD1 with liquid-biopsy based risk profiling. Further utilization of these models would allow tailoring of interventional strategies according to individual profiles.","In conclusion, we found changes in circulating cytokines and growth factors of patients undergoing major liver resection that are clearly linked to the postoperative morbidity and mortality. With the demonstrated liquid biopsy-based approach we are able to predict potentially fatal postoperative clinical outcomes and the individual regenerative potential. This approach may allow a risk-adapted selection of patients. To strengthen the data-base of the model before incorporation in the clinical routine we aspire to include larger and more refined multi-center cohorts.","Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Molecular map of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and its impact on outcome,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-022-01140-w,04 Aug 2022,"Recent advances in cancer characterization have consistently revealed marked heterogeneity, impeding the completion of integrated molecular and clinical maps for each malignancy. Here, we focus on chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a B cell neoplasm with variable natural history that is conventionally categorized into two subtypes distinguished by extent of somatic mutations in the heavy-chain variable region of immunoglobulin genes (IGHV). To build the ‘CLL map,’ we integrated genomic, transcriptomic and epigenomic data from 1,148 patients. We identified 202 candidate genetic drivers of CLL (109 new) and refined the characterization of IGHV subtypes, which revealed distinct genomic landscapes and leukemogenic trajectories. Discovery of new gene expression subtypes further subcategorized this neoplasm and proved to be independent prognostic factors. Clinical outcomes were associated with a combination of genetic, epigenetic and gene expression features, further advancing our prognostic paradigm. Overall, this work reveals fresh insights into CLL oncogenesis and prognostication.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Identifying neurocognitive disorder using vector representation of free conversation,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-16204-4,03 Aug 2022,"In recent years, studies on the use of natural language processing (NLP) approaches to identify dementia have been reported. Most of these studies used picture description tasks or other similar tasks to encourage spontaneous speech, but the use of free conversation without requiring a task might be easier to perform in a clinical setting. Moreover, free conversation is unlikely to induce a learning effect. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to develop a machine learning model to discriminate subjects with and without dementia by extracting features from unstructured free conversation data using NLP. We recruited patients who visited a specialized outpatient clinic for dementia and healthy volunteers. Participants’ conversation was transcribed and the text data was decomposed from natural sentences into morphemes by performing a morphological analysis using NLP, and then converted into real-valued vectors that were used as features for machine learning. A total of 432 datasets were used, and the resulting machine learning model classified the data for dementia and non-dementia subjects with an accuracy of 0.900, sensitivity of 0.881, and a specificity of 0.916. Using sentence vector information, it was possible to develop a machine-learning algorithm capable of discriminating dementia from non-dementia subjects with a high accuracy based on free conversation.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Automatic vocalisation-based detection of fragile X syndrome and Rett syndrome,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-17203-1,03 Aug 2022,"Fragile X syndrome (FXS) and Rett syndrome (RTT) are developmental disorders currently not diagnosed before toddlerhood. Even though speech-language deficits are among the key symptoms of both conditions, little is known about infant vocalisation acoustics for an automatic earlier identification of affected individuals. To bridge this gap, we applied intelligent audio analysis methodology to a compact dataset of 4454 home-recorded vocalisations of 3 individuals with FXS and 3 individuals with RTT aged 6 to 11 months, as well as 6 age- and gender-matched typically developing controls (TD). On the basis of a standardised set of 88 acoustic features, we trained linear kernel support vector machines to evaluate the feasibility of automatic classification of (a) FXS vs TD, (b) RTT vs TD, (c) atypical development (FXS+RTT) vs TD, and (d) FXS vs RTT vs TD. In paradigms (a)–(c), all infants were correctly classified; in paradigm (d), 9 of 12 were so. Spectral/cepstral and energy-related features were most relevant for classification across all paradigms. Despite the small sample size, this study reveals new insights into early vocalisation characteristics in FXS and RTT, and provides technical underpinnings for a future earlier identification of affected individuals, enabling earlier intervention and family counselling.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Daily 1 km terrain resolving maps of surface fine particulate matter for the western United States 2003–2021,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01488-y,02 Aug 2022,"We developed daily maps of surface fine particulate matter (PM2.5) for the western United States. We used geographically weighted regression fit to air quality station observations with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol optical depth (AOD) data, and meteorological data to produce daily 1-kilometer resolution PM2.5 concentration estimates from 2003–2020. To account for impacts of stagnant air and inversions, we included estimates of inversion strength based on meteorological conditions, and inversion potential based on human activities and local topography. Model accuracy based on cross-validation was R2 = 0.66. AOD data improve the model in summer and fall during periods of high wildfire activity while the stagnation terms capture the spatial and temporal dynamics of PM2.5 in mountain valleys, particularly during winter. These data can be used to explore exposure and health outcome impacts of PM2.5 across spatiotemporal domains particularly in the intermountain western United States where measurements from monitoring station data are sparse. Furthermore, these data may facilitate analyses of inversion impacts and local topography on exposure and health outcome studies.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: ; Attacker Capability: 
Real-time fMRI neurofeedback: the promising potential of brain-training technology to advance clinical neuroscience,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41386-022-01397-z,01 Aug 2022,"Although functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has advanced our understanding of the organization of the brain with the discovery of large-scale networks, the impact of this knowledge on the diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric conditions has yet to be fully realized. The development of real-time fMRI neurofeedback (rtfMRI-NF) provides a promising avenue by which fMRI might enter the clinic. First described two decades ago, the field has matured substantially, with specialized conferences, randomized clinical trials, and multisite consortia. A recent consensus statement outlines methodological approaches and important challenges [1]. A substantial evidence base describes applications in psychiatric [2] and substance use disorders [3]. The first meta-analysis of rtfMRI-NF for psychiatric disorders [2] in 17 studies meeting criteria for inclusion in the analysis recently reported a strong effect size for ‘transfer,’ which is to say—the demonstration that NF-trained subjects can maintain the ability to regulate neural signal in the absence of feedback—in comparison to subjects trained with sham/control feedback, (Hedges g = 0.84, p = 0.005). This analysis demonstrates the feasibility of rtfMRI-NF training for psychiatric patients, 52.9% of whom were taking medications. However, the effect on behavioral outcomes in this heterogeneous group was modest (overall symptoms: g = 0.37, p = 0.002; cognition: g = 0.23, p = 0.288). It should be noted that the studies conducted training for an average of only 2.3 sessions (range = 1–4), and this line of investigation opens some promising avenues where the techniques could be refined and improved to generate more robust clinical outcomes.",Conclusions not available,Gen AI,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Prediction algorithm for ICU mortality and length of stay using machine learning,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-17091-5,28 Jul 2022,"Machine learning can predict outcomes and determine variables contributing to precise prediction, and can thus classify patients with different risk factors of outcomes. This study aimed to investigate the predictive accuracy for mortality and length of stay in intensive care unit (ICU) patients using machine learning, and to identify the variables contributing to the precise prediction or classification of patients. Patients (n = 12,747) admitted to the ICU at Chiba University Hospital were randomly assigned to the training and test cohorts. After learning using the variables on admission in the training cohort, the area under the curve (AUC) was analyzed in the test cohort to evaluate the predictive accuracy of the supervised machine learning classifiers, including random forest (RF) for outcomes (primary outcome, mortality; secondary outcome, length of ICU stay). The rank of the variables that contributed to the machine learning prediction was confirmed, and cluster analysis of the patients with risk factors of mortality was performed to identify the important variables associated with patient outcomes. Machine learning using RF revealed a high predictive value for mortality, with an AUC of 0.945 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.922–0.977). In addition, RF showed high predictive value for short and long ICU stays, with AUCs of 0.881 (95% CI 0.876–0.908) and 0.889 (95% CI 0.849–0.936), respectively. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was identified as a variable contributing to the precise prediction in machine learning for both mortality and length of ICU stay. LDH was also identified as a contributing variable to classify patients into sub-populations based on different risk factors of mortality. The machine learning algorithm could predict mortality and length of stay in ICU patients with high accuracy. LDH was identified as a contributing variable in mortality and length of ICU stay prediction and could be used to classify patients based on mortality risk.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Construction of a new automatic grading system for jaw bone mineral density level based on deep learning using cone beam computed tomography,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-16074-w,27 Jul 2022,"To develop and verify an automatic classification method using artificial intelligence deep learning to determine the bone mineral density level of the implant site in oral implant surgery from radiographic data obtained from cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) images. Seventy patients with mandibular dentition defects were scanned using CBCT. These Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine data were cut into 605 training sets, and then the data were processed with data standardization, and the Hounsfiled Unit (HU) value level was determined as follows: Type 1, 1000–2000; type 2, 700–1000; type 3, 400–700; type 4, 100–400; and type 5, − 200–100. Four trained dental implant physicians manually identified and classified the area of the jaw bone density level in the image using the software LabelMe. Then, with the assistance of the HU value generated by LabelMe, a physician with 20 years of clinical experience confirmed the labeling level. Finally, the HU mean values of various categories marked by dental implant physicians were compared to the mean values detected by the artificial intelligence model to assess the accuracy of artificial intelligence classification. After the model was trained on 605 training sets, the statistical results of the HU mean values of various categories in the dataset detected by the model were almost the same as the HU grading interval on the data annotation. This new classification provides a more detailed solution to guide surgeons to adjust the drilling rate and tool selection during preoperative decision-making and intraoperative hole preparation for oral implant surgery.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Automatic scoring of COVID-19 severity in X-ray imaging based on a novel deep learning workflow,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-15013-z,27 Jul 2022,"In this study, we propose a two-stage workflow used for the segmentation and scoring of lung diseases. The workflow inherits quantification, qualification, and visual assessment of lung diseases on X-ray images estimated by radiologists and clinicians. It requires the fulfillment of two core stages devoted to lung and disease segmentation as well as an additional post-processing stage devoted to scoring. The latter integrated block is utilized, mainly, for the estimation of segment scores and computes the overall severity score of a patient. The models of the proposed workflow were trained and tested on four publicly available X-ray datasets of COVID-19 patients and two X-ray datasets of patients with no pulmonary pathology. Based on a combined dataset consisting of 580 COVID-19 patients and 784 patients with no disorders, our best-performing algorithm is based on a combination of DeepLabV3 + , for lung segmentation, and MA-Net, for disease segmentation. The proposed algorithms’ mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.30 is significantly reduced in comparison to established COVID-19 algorithms; BS-net and COVID-Net-S, possessing MAEs of 2.52 and 1.83 respectively. Moreover, the proposed two-stage workflow was not only more accurate but also computationally efficient, it was approximately 11 times faster than the mentioned methods. In summary, we proposed an accurate, time-efficient, and versatile approach for segmentation and scoring of lung diseases illustrated for COVID-19 and with broader future applications for pneumonia, tuberculosis, pneumothorax, amongst others.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Identification of robust deep neural network models of longitudinal clinical measurements,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-022-00651-4,27 Jul 2022,"Deep learning (DL) from electronic health records holds promise for disease prediction, but systematic methods for learning from simulated longitudinal clinical measurements have yet to be reported. We compared nine DL frameworks using simulated body mass index (BMI), glucose, and systolic blood pressure trajectories, independently isolated shape and magnitude changes, and evaluated model performance across various parameters (e.g., irregularity, missingness). Overall, discrimination based on variation in shape was more challenging than magnitude. Time-series forest-convolutional neural networks (TSF-CNN) and Gramian angular field(GAF)-CNN outperformed other approaches (P < 0.05) with overall area-under-the-curve (AUCs) of 0.93 for both models, and 0.92 and 0.89 for variation in magnitude and shape with up to 50% missing data. Furthermore, in a real-world assessment, the TSF-CNN model predicted T2D with AUCs reaching 0.72 using only BMI trajectories.

Diffuse correlation spectroscopy blood flow monitoring for intraventricular hemorrhage vulnerability in extremely low gestational age newborns,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-16499-3,27 Jul 2022,"In premature infants with an extremely low gestational age (ELGA, < 29 weeks GA), dysregulated changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) are among the major pathogenic factors leading to germinal matrix/intraventricular hemorrhage (GM/IVH). Continuous monitoring of CBF can guide interventions to minimize the risk of brain injury, but there are no clinically standard techniques or tools for its measurement. We report the feasibility of the continuous monitoring of CBF, including measures of autoregulation, via diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) in ELGA infants using CBF variability and correlation with scalp blood flow (SBF, served as a surrogate measure of systemic perturbations). In nineteen ELGA infants (with 9 cases of GM/IVH) monitored for 6–24 h between days 2–5 of life, we found a strong correlation between CBF and SBF in severe IVH (Grade III or IV) and IVH diagnosed within 72 h of life, while CBF variability alone was not associated with IVH.

Applying machine learning and predictive modeling to retention and viral suppression in South African HIV treatment cohorts,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-16062-0,26 Jul 2022,"HIV treatment programs face challenges in identifying patients at risk for loss-to-follow-up and uncontrolled viremia. We applied predictive machine learning algorithms to anonymised, patient-level HIV programmatic data from two districts in South Africa, 2016–2018. We developed patient risk scores for two outcomes: (1) visit attendance ≤ 28 days of the next scheduled clinic visit and (2) suppression of the next HIV viral load (VL). Demographic, clinical, behavioral and laboratory data were investigated in multiple models as predictor variables of attending the next scheduled visit and VL results at the next test. Three classification algorithms (logistical regression, random forest and AdaBoost) were evaluated for building predictive models. Data were randomly sampled on a 70/30 split into a training and test set. The training set included a balanced set of positive and negative examples from which the classification algorithm could learn. The predictor variable data from the unseen test set were given to the model, and each predicted outcome was scored against known outcomes. Finally, we estimated performance metrics for each model in terms of sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value and area under the curve (AUC). In total, 445,636 patients were included in the retention model and 363,977 in the VL model. The predictive metric (AUC) ranged from 0.69 for attendance at the next scheduled visit to 0.76 for VL suppression, suggesting that the model correctly classified whether a scheduled visit would be attended in 2 of 3 patients and whether the VL result at the next test would be suppressed in approximately 3 of 4 patients. Variables that were important predictors of both outcomes included prior late visits, number of prior VL tests, time since their last visit, number of visits on their current regimen, age, and treatment duration. For retention, the number of visits at the current facility and the details of the next appointment date were also predictors, while for VL suppression, other predictors included the range of the previous VL value. Machine learning can identify HIV patients at risk for disengagement and unsuppressed VL. Predictive modeling can improve the targeting of interventions through differentiated models of care before patients disengage from treatment programmes, increasing cost-effectiveness and improving patient outcomes.","Predictive models and machine learning can identify and target HIV patients at risk for disengaging from care and not being virally suppressed. Our approach could enable anticipation of future outcomes before any visible signs and/or poor outcomes occur (e.g., an unsuppressed VL) and, most importantly, while the patient is still engaged in care. This affords the opportunity to take a proactive approach to patient management—specific targeted interventions can be designed on identified subsets of the treatment cohorts, allowing for cost-effective differentiated models on care and treatment to be applied across the cascade. This approach could also be extended to other key HIV outcomes, allowing for the use of a cost-effective and precision programming approach.","Traditional ML, DNN",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Ultrasound-based radiomics technology in fetal lung texture analysis prediction of neonatal respiratory morbidity,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-17129-8,26 Jul 2022,"To develop a novel method for predicting neonatal respiratory morbidity (NRM) by ultrasound-based radiomics technology. In this retrospective study, 430 high-throughput features per fetal-lung image were extracted from 295 fetal lung ultrasound images (four-chamber view) in 295 single pregnancies. Images had been obtained between 28+3 and 37+6 weeks of gestation within 72 h before delivery. A machine-learning model built by RUSBoost (Random under-sampling with AdaBoost) architecture was created using 20 radiomics features extracted from the images and 2 clinical features (gestational age and pregnancy complications) to predict the possibility of NRM. Of the 295 standard fetal lung ultrasound images included, 210 in the training set and 85 in the testing set. The overall performance of the neonatal respiratory morbidity prediction model achieved AUC of 0.88 (95% CI 0.83–0.92) in the training set and 0.83 (95% CI 0.79–0.97) in the testing set, sensitivity of 84.31% (95% CI 79.06–89.44%) in the training set and 77.78% (95% CI 68.30–87.43%) in the testing set, specificity of 81.13% (95% CI 78.16–84.07%) in the training set and 82.09% (95% CI 77.65–86.62%) in the testing set, and accuracy of 81.90% (95% CI 79.34–84.41%) in the training set and 81.18% (95% CI 77.33–85.12%) in the testing set.

A methodology for evaluating digital contact tracing apps based on the COVID-19 experience,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-17024-2,26 Jul 2022,"Controlling the spreading of infectious diseases has been shown crucial in the COVID-19 pandemic. Traditional contact tracing is used to detect newly infected individuals by tracing their previous contacts, and by selectively checking and isolating any individuals likely to have been infected. Digital contact tracing with the utilisation of smartphones was contrived as a technological aid to improve this manual, slow and tedious process. Nevertheless, despite the high hopes raised when smartphone-based contact tracing apps were introduced as a measure to reduce the spread of the COVID-19, their efficiency has been moderately low. In this paper, we propose a methodology for evaluating digital contact tracing apps, based on an epidemic model, which will be used not only to evaluate the deployed Apps against the COVID-19 but also to determine how they can be improved for future pandemics. Firstly, the model confirms the moderate effectiveness of the deployed digital contact tracing, confirming the fact that it could not be used as the unique measure to fight against the COVID-19, and had to be combined with additional measures. Secondly, several improvements are proposed (and evaluated) to increase the efficiency of digital control tracing to become a more useful tool in the future.","The key (and regretful) issue is why digital technology has failed to stem the worst pandemic in a century. The causes are not only technical; in fact, lack of coordination between countries and states, test shortages, and mistrust of technology are cited among the main social and political causes.Summing up, based on the evaluations performed using our proposed model, we can derive the following conclusions:

The efficacy of the deployed digital contact tracing applications, with an adoption ratio of around 20% (in countries where they were not mandatory), was quite limited. Therefore, it was necessary to use other measures.


Adoption ratio is the critical factor in improving its effectiveness. Although it is not specifically a technical factor, this adoption ratio can be increased by installing and activating the app by default (known as the opt-out strategy) or by using it only for cohorts (subsets of the population).


A higher accuracy in detecting the risky contacts is required to avoid false alerts and an excessive number of quarantined individuals. This accuracy plays a key role, as false alerts can undermine users’ confidence in digital contact tracing, thus reducing its adoption ratio.


The implemented decentralised approach penalised the performance of digital contact tracing. Thus, a centralised approach provides faster contact tracing, which is essential to detect and quarantine possible newly infected individuals.


Fortunately, with these technical improvements, and when combined with other mitigation measures, digital contact tracing can avert a reasonable number of infected individuals and deaths, even with adoption ratios around 20%, and high reproductive ratios.",Gen AI,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: ; Attacker Capability: 
Solution structure of recombinant Pvfp-5β reveals insights into mussel adhesion,https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-022-03699-w,25 Jul 2022,"Some marine organisms can resist to aqueous tidal environments and adhere tightly on wet surface. This behavior has raised increasing attention for potential applications in medicine, biomaterials, and tissue engineering. In mussels, adhesive forces to the rock are the resultant of proteinic fibrous formations called byssus. We present the solution structure of Pvfp-5β, one of the three byssal plaque proteins secreted by the Asian green mussel Perna viridis, and the component responsible for initiating interactions with the substrate. We demonstrate that Pvfp-5β has a stably folded structure in agreement with the presence in the sequence of two EGF motifs. The structure is highly rigid except for a few residues affected by slow local motions in the µs-ms time scale, and differs from the model calculated by artificial intelligence methods for the relative orientation of the EGF modules, which is something where computational methods still underperform. We also show that Pvfp-5β is able to coacervate even with no DOPA modification, giving thus insights both for understanding the adhesion mechanism of adhesive mussel proteins, and developing of biomaterials.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: ; Attacker Capability:

Persistent inequities across the lifespan result in shorter life expectancies among AIAN individuals than any other racial group in the United States [2]. One challenge to improving health and healthcare of AIAN families is the lack of representation in research [3]. This is partly due to the small proportion of AIAN individuals in the US population (constituting roughly two percent). While the gold standard in analyses of racial disparities in health is to use self-identified race [4], advanced statistical models often cannot accommodate very small sample sizes [5]. As such, AIAN individuals often are absorbed into an “other” category when analyzing health outcomes, including preterm birth. Such aggregation can mask actionable disparities.",Conclusions not available,,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: ; Attacker Capability: 
Human–machine teaming is key to AI adoption: clinicians’ experiences with a deployed machine learning system,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-022-00597-7,21 Jul 2022,"While a growing number of machine learning (ML) systems have been deployed in clinical settings with the promise of improving patient care, many have struggled to gain adoption and realize this promise. Based on a qualitative analysis of coded interviews with clinicians who use an ML-based system for sepsis, we found that, rather than viewing the system as a surrogate for their clinical judgment, clinicians perceived themselves as partnering with the technology. Our findings suggest that, even without a deep understanding of machine learning, clinicians can build trust with an ML system through experience, expert endorsement and validation, and systems designed to accommodate clinicians’ autonomy and support them across their entire workflow.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Decision effect of a deep-learning model to assist a head computed tomography order for pediatric traumatic brain injury,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-16313-0,21 Jul 2022,"The study aims to measure the effectiveness of an AI-based traumatic intracranial hemorrhage prediction model in the decisions of emergency physicians regarding ordering head computed tomography (CT) scans. We developed a deep-learning model for predicting traumatic intracranial hemorrhages (DEEPTICH) using a national trauma registry with 1.8 million cases. For simulation, 24 cases were selected from previous emergency department cases. For each case, physicians made decisions on ordering a head CT twice: initially without the DEEPTICH assistance, and subsequently with the DEEPTICH assistance. Of the 528 responses from 22 participants, 201 initial decisions were different from the DEEPTICH recommendations. Of these 201 initial decisions, 94 were changed after DEEPTICH assistance (46.8%). For the cases in which CT was initially not ordered, 71.4% of the decisions were changed (p < 0.001), and for the cases in which CT was initially ordered, 37.2% (p < 0.001) of the decisions were changed after DEEPTICH assistance. When using DEEPTICH, 46 (11.6%) unnecessary CTs were avoided (p < 0.001) and 10 (11.4%) traumatic intracranial hemorrhages (ICHs) that would have been otherwise missed were found (p = 0.039). We found that emergency physicians were likely to accept AI based on how they perceived its safety.","DEEPTICH affects decisions of emergency physicians to order head CTs, as demonstrated by the decision simulation study. The effectiveness of the model is more significant when the model recommends ordering of head CTs.","Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Dynamic prediction of mortality after traumatic brain injury using a machine learning algorithm,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-022-00652-3,18 Jul 2022,"Intensive care for patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) aims to optimize intracranial pressure (ICP) and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP). The transformation of ICP and CPP time-series data into a dynamic prediction model could aid clinicians to make more data-driven treatment decisions. We retrained and externally validated a machine learning model to dynamically predict the risk of mortality in patients with TBI. Retraining was done in 686 patients with 62,000 h of data and validation was done in two international cohorts including 638 patients with 60,000 h of data. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve increased with time to 0.79 and 0.73 and the precision recall curve increased with time to 0.57 and 0.64 in the Swedish and American validation cohorts, respectively. The rate of false positives decreased to ≤2.5%. The algorithm provides dynamic mortality predictions during intensive care that improved with increasing data and may have a role as a clinical decision support tool.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Multisite implementation of a workflow-integrated machine learning system to optimize COVID-19 hospital admission decisions,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-022-00646-1,16 Jul 2022,"Demand has outstripped healthcare supply during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Emergency departments (EDs) are tasked with distinguishing patients who require hospital resources from those who may be safely discharged to the community. The novelty and high variability of COVID-19 have made these determinations challenging. In this study, we developed, implemented and evaluated an electronic health record (EHR) embedded clinical decision support (CDS) system that leverages machine learning (ML) to estimate short-term risk for clinical deterioration in patients with or under investigation for COVID-19. The system translates model-generated risk for critical care needs within 24 h and inpatient care needs within 72 h into rapidly interpretable COVID-19 Deterioration Risk Levels made viewable within ED clinician workflow. ML models were derived in a retrospective cohort of 21,452 ED patients who visited one of five ED study sites and were prospectively validated in 15,670 ED visits that occurred before (n = 4322) or after (n = 11,348) CDS implementation; model performance and numerous patient-oriented outcomes including in-hospital mortality were measured across study periods. Incidence of critical care needs within 24 h and inpatient care needs within 72 h were 10.7% and 22.5%, respectively and were similar across study periods. ML model performance was excellent under all conditions, with AUC ranging from 0.85 to 0.91 for prediction of critical care needs and 0.80–0.90 for inpatient care needs. Total mortality was unchanged across study periods but was reduced among high-risk patients after CDS implementation.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

The B-Score sets absolute blood pressure estimation model performance in contrast to the dataset the model is tested upon. We calculate the B-Score based on inter- and intrapersonal variabilities within the dataset. To test the B-Score for reliable results and desired properties, we designed generic datasets with differing inter- and intrapersonal blood pressure variability. We then tested the B-Score’s real-world functionality with a small, published dataset and the largest available blood pressure dataset (MIMIC IV). The B-Score demonstrated reliable and desired properties. The real-world test provided allowed the direct comparison of different datasets and revealed insights hidden from absolute performance measures. The B-Score is a functional, novel, and easy to interpret measure of relative blood pressure estimation system performance. It is easily calculated for any dataset and enables the direct comparison of various systems tested on different datasets. We created a metric for direct blood pressure estimation system performance. The B-Score allows researchers to detect promising trends quickly and reliably in the scientific literature. It further allows researchers and engineers to quickly assess and compare performances of various systems and algorithms, even when tested on different datasets.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
The Medical Segmentation Decathlon,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-30695-9,15 Jul 2022,"International challenges have become the de facto standard for comparative assessment of image analysis algorithms. Although segmentation is the most widely investigated medical image processing task, the various challenges have been organized to focus only on specific clinical tasks. We organized the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD)—a biomedical image analysis challenge, in which algorithms compete in a multitude of both tasks and modalities to investigate the hypothesis that a method capable of performing well on multiple tasks will generalize well to a previously unseen task and potentially outperform a custom-designed solution. MSD results confirmed this hypothesis, moreover, MSD winner continued generalizing well to a wide range of other clinical problems for the next two years. Three main conclusions can be drawn from this study: (1) state-of-the-art image segmentation algorithms generalize well when retrained on unseen tasks; (2) consistent algorithmic performance across multiple tasks is a strong surrogate of algorithmic generalizability; (3) the training of accurate AI segmentation models is now commoditized to scientists that are not versed in AI model training.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Partial freezing of rat livers extends preservation time by 5-fold,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-31490-2,15 Jul 2022,"The limited preservation duration of organs has contributed to the shortage of organs for transplantation. Recently, a tripling of the storage duration was achieved with supercooling, which relies on temperatures between −4 and −6 °C. However, to achieve deeper metabolic stasis, lower temperatures are required. Inspired by freeze-tolerant animals, we entered high-subzero temperatures (−10 to −15 °C) using ice nucleators to control ice and cryoprotective agents (CPAs) to maintain an unfrozen liquid fraction. We present this approach, termed partial freezing, by testing gradual (un)loading and different CPAs, holding temperatures, and storage durations. Results indicate that propylene glycol outperforms glycerol and injury is largely influenced by storage temperatures. Subsequently, we demonstrate that machine perfusion enhancements improve the recovery of livers after freezing. Ultimately, livers that were partially frozen for 5-fold longer showed favorable outcomes as compared to viable controls, although frozen livers had lower cumulative bile and higher liver enzymes.",Conclusions not available,Gen AI,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

To develop a neural network (NN)-based method for diagnosis and severity assessment of Graves’ orbitopathy (GO) using orbital CT, a specific type of NN optimized for diagnosing GO was developed and trained using 288 orbital CT scans obtained from patients with mild and moderate-to-severe GO and normal controls. The developed NN was compared with three conventional NNs [GoogleNet Inception v1 (GoogLeNet), 50-layer Deep Residual Learning (ResNet-50), and 16-layer Very Deep Convolutional Network from Visual Geometry group (VGG-16)]. The diagnostic performance was also compared with that of three oculoplastic specialists. The developed NN had an area under receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.979 for diagnosing patients with moderate-to-severe GO. Receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis yielded AUCs of 0.827 for GoogLeNet, 0.611 for ResNet-50, 0.540 for VGG-16, and 0.975 for the oculoplastic specialists for diagnosing moderate-to-severe GO. For the diagnosis of mild GO, the developed NN yielded an AUC of 0.895, which is better than the performances of the other NNs and oculoplastic specialists.

Clustering analysis and prognostic signature of lung adenocarcinoma based on the tumor microenvironment,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-15971-4,14 Jul 2022,"Because of immunotherapy failure in lung adenocarcinoma, we have tried to find new potential biomarkers for differentiating different tumor subtypes and predicting prognosis. We identified two subtypes based on tumor microenvironment-related genes in this study. We used seven methods to analyze the immune cell infiltration between subgroups. Further analysis of tumor mutation load and immune checkpoint expression among different subgroups was performed. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator Cox regression was applied for further selection. The selected genes were used to construct a prognostic 14-gene signature for LUAD. Next, a survival analysis and time-dependent receiver operating characteristics were performed to verify and evaluate the model. Gene set enrichment analyses and immune analysis in risk groups was also performed. According to the expression of genes related to the tumor microenvironment, lung adenocarcinoma can be divided into cold tumors and hot tumors. The signature we built was able to predict prognosis more accurately than previously known models. The signature-based tumor microenvironment provides further insight into the prediction of lung adenocarcinoma prognosis and may guide individualized treatment.","In conclusion, LUAD patients could be divided into two subgroups according to TME-related genes. Their immune status is different and may guide patients to personalized treatment. Our study proposes a TME-related signature that could be implemented in assessing LUAD patients and might improve prognostic accuracy.","Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Preoperative prediction of the need for arterial and central venous catheterization using machine learning techniques,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-16144-z,13 Jul 2022,"Some surgical patients require an arterial or central venous catheterization intraoperatively. This decision relied solely on the experience of individual anesthesiologists; however, these decisions are not easy for clinicians who are in an emergency or inexperienced. Therefore, applying recent artificial intelligence techniques to automatically extractable data from electronic medical record (EMR) could create a very clinically useful model in this situation. This study aimed to develop a model that is easy to apply in real clinical settings by implementing a prediction model for the preoperative decision to insert an arterial and central venous catheter and that can be automatically linked to the EMR. We collected and retrospectively analyzed data from 66,522 patients, > 18 years of age, who underwent non-cardiac surgeries from March 2019 to April 2021 at the single tertiary medical center. Data included demographics, pre-operative laboratory tests, surgical information, and catheterization information. When compared with other machine learning methods, the DNN model showed the best predictive performance in terms of the area under receiver operating characteristic curve and area under the precision-recall curve. Operation code information accounted for the largest portion of the prediction. This can be applied to clinical fields using operation code and minimal preoperative clinical information.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Application of machine learning methods for the prediction of true fasting status in patients performing blood tests,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-15161-2,13 Jul 2022,"The fasting blood glucose (FBG) values extracted from electronic medical records (EMR) are assumed valid in existing research, which may cause diagnostic bias due to misclassification of fasting status. We proposed a machine learning (ML) algorithm to predict the fasting status of blood samples. This cross-sectional study was conducted using the EMR of a medical center from 2003 to 2018 and a total of 2,196,833 ontological FBGs from the outpatient service were enrolled. The theoretical true fasting status are identified by comparing the values of ontological FBG with average glucose levels derived from concomitant tested HbA1c based on multi-criteria. In addition to multiple logistic regression, we extracted 67 features to predict the fasting status by eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). The discrimination and calibration of the prediction models were also assessed. Real-world performance was gauged by the prevalence of ineffective glucose measurement (IGM). Of the 784,340 ontologically labeled fasting samples, 77.1% were considered theoretical FBGs. The median (IQR) glucose and HbA1c level of ontological and theoretical fasting samples in patients without diabetes mellitus (DM) were 94.0 (87.0, 102.0) mg/dL and 5.6 (5.4, 5.9)%, and 92.0 (86.0, 99.0) mg/dL and 5.6 (5.4, 5.9)%, respectively. The XGBoost showed comparable calibration and AUROC of 0.887 than that of 0.868 in multiple logistic regression in the parsimonious approach and identified important predictors of glucose level, home-to-hospital distance, age, and concomitantly serum creatinine and lipid testing. The prevalence of IGM dropped from 27.8% based on ontological FBGs to 0.48% by using algorithm-verified FBGs. The proposed ML algorithm or multiple logistic regression model aids in verification of the fasting status.","To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at using a ML approach to evaluate the reliability of fasting samples in a large tertiary hospital. Only 65.3% of ontologically AC samples could be classified as algorithm-verified fasting status. Despite its moderate performance in predicting the fasting status among outpatients, our algorithms provide an innovative approach to clean medical data and facilitate true fasting BG detection. Notably, this study has introduced an essential step towards establishing automated phenotyping in EMR for effective diabetic screening and more accurate estimation of the global and local epidemiology of DM.","Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Exploratory analysis using machine learning of predictive factors for falls in type 2 diabetes,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-15224-4,13 Jul 2022,"We aimed to investigate the status of falls and to identify important risk factors for falls in persons with type 2 diabetes (T2D) including the non-elderly. Participants were 316 persons with T2D who were assessed for medical history, laboratory data and physical capabilities during hospitalization and given a questionnaire on falls one year after discharge. Two different statistical models, logistic regression and random forest classifier, were used to identify the important predictors of falls. The response rate to the survey was 72%; of the 226 respondents, there were 129 males and 97 females (median age 62 years). The fall rate during the first year after discharge was 19%. Logistic regression revealed that knee extension strength, fasting C-peptide (F-CPR) level and dorsiflexion strength were independent predictors of falls. The random forest classifier placed grip strength, F-CPR, knee extension strength, dorsiflexion strength and proliferative diabetic retinopathy among the 5 most important variables for falls. Lower extremity muscle weakness, elevated F-CPR levels and reduced grip strength were shown to be important risk factors for falls in T2D.

MRI based radiomics enhances prediction of neurodevelopmental outcome in very preterm neonates,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-16066-w,13 Jul 2022,"To predict adverse neurodevelopmental outcome of very preterm neonates. A total of 166 preterm neonates born between 24–32 weeks’ gestation underwent brain MRI early in life. Radiomics features were extracted from T1- and T2- weighted images. Motor, cognitive, and language outcomes were assessed at a corrected age of 18 and 33 months and 4.5 years. Elastic Net was implemented to select the clinical and radiomic features that best predicted outcome. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve was used to determine the predictive ability of each feature set. Clinical variables predicted cognitive outcome at 18 months with AUROC 0.76 and motor outcome at 4.5 years with AUROC 0.78. T1-radiomics features showed better prediction than T2-radiomics on the total motor outcome at 18 months and gross motor outcome at 33 months (AUROC: 0.81 vs 0.66 and 0.77 vs 0.7).

Multi-center validation of machine learning model for preoperative prediction of postoperative mortality,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-022-00625-6,12 Jul 2022,"Accurate prediction of postoperative mortality is important for not only successful postoperative patient care but also for information-based shared decision-making with patients and efficient allocation of medical resources. This study aimed to create a machine-learning prediction model for 30-day mortality after a non-cardiac surgery that adapts to the manageable amount of clinical information as input features and is validated against multi-centered rather than single-centered data. Data were collected from 454,404 patients over 18 years of age who underwent non-cardiac surgeries from four independent institutions. We performed a retrospective analysis of the retrieved data. Only 12–18 clinical variables were used for model training. Logistic regression, random forest classifier, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and deep neural network methods were applied to compare the prediction performances. To reduce overfitting and create a robust model, bootstrapping and grid search with tenfold cross-validation were performed. The XGBoost method in Seoul National University Hospital (SNUH) data delivers the best performance in terms of the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) (0.9376) and the area under the precision-recall curve (0.1593). The predictive performance was the best when the SNUH model was validated with Ewha Womans University Medical Center data (AUROC, 0.941). Preoperative albumin, prothrombin time, and age were the most important features in the model for each hospital.

Age group prediction with panoramic radiomorphometric parameters using machine learning algorithms,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-15691-9,09 Jul 2022,"The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship of 18 radiomorphometric parameters of panoramic radiographs based on age, and to estimate the age group of people with permanent dentition in a non-invasive, comprehensive, and accurate manner using five machine learning algorithms. For the study population (209 men and 262 women; mean age, 32.12 ± 18.71 years), 471 digital panoramic radiographs of Korean individuals were applied. The participants were divided into three groups (with a 20-year age gap) and six groups (with a 10-year age gap), and each age group was estimated using the following five machine learning models: a linear discriminant analysis, logistic regression, kernelized support vector machines, multilayer perceptron, and extreme gradient boosting. Finally, a Fisher discriminant analysis was used to visualize the data configuration. In the prediction of the three age-group classification, the areas under the curve (AUCs) obtained for classifying young ages (10–19 years) ranged from 0.85 to 0.88 for five different machine learning models. The AUC values of the older age group (50–69 years) ranged from 0.82 to 0.88, and those of adults (20–49 years) were approximately 0.73. In the six age-group classification, the best scores were also found in age groups 1 (10–19 years) and 6 (60–69 years), with mean AUCs ranging from 0.85 to 0.87 and 80 to 0.90, respectively. A feature analysis based on LDA weights showed that the L-Pulp Area was important for discriminating young ages (10–49 years), and L-Crown, U-Crown, L-Implant, U-Implant, and Periodontitis were used as predictors for discriminating older ages (50–69 years). We established acceptable linear and nonlinear machine learning models for a dental age group estimation using multiple maxillary and mandibular radiomorphometric parameters. Since certain radiomorphological characteristics of young and the elderly were linearly related to age, young and old groups could be easily distinguished from other age groups with automated machine learning models.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Dental anomaly detection using intraoral photos via deep learning,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-15788-1,08 Jul 2022,"Children with orofacial clefting (OFC) present with a wide range of dental anomalies. Identifying these anomalies is vital to understand their etiology and to discern the complex phenotypic spectrum of OFC. Such anomalies are currently identified using intra-oral exams by dentists, a costly and time-consuming process. We claim that automating the process of anomaly detection using deep neural networks (DNNs) could increase efficiency and provide reliable anomaly detection while potentially increasing the speed of research discovery. This study characterizes the use of` DNNs to identify dental anomalies by training a DNN model using intraoral photographs from the largest international cohort to date of children with nonsyndromic OFC and controls (OFC1). In this project, the intraoral images were submitted to a Convolutional Neural Network model to perform multi-label multi-class classification of 10 dental anomalies. The network predicts whether an individual exhibits any of the 10 anomalies and can do so significantly faster than a human rater can. For all but three anomalies, F1 scores suggest that our model performs competitively at anomaly detection when compared to a dentist with 8 years of clinical experience. In addition, we use saliency maps to provide a post-hoc interpretation for our model’s predictions. This enables dentists to examine and verify our model’s predictions.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

"HistoML, a markup language for representation and exchange of histopathological features in pathology images",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01505-0,08 Jul 2022,"The study of histopathological phenotypes is vital for cancer research and medicine as it links molecular mechanisms to disease prognosis. It typically involves integration of heterogenous histopathological features in whole-slide images (WSI) to objectively characterize a histopathological phenotype. However, the large-scale implementation of phenotype characterization has been hindered by the fragmentation of histopathological features, resulting from the lack of a standardized format and a controlled vocabulary for structured and unambiguous representation of semantics in WSIs. To fill this gap, we propose the Histopathology Markup Language (HistoML), a representation language along with a controlled vocabulary (Histopathology Ontology) based on Semantic Web technologies. Multiscale features within a WSI, from single-cell features to mesoscopic features, could be represented using HistoML which is a crucial step towards the goal of making WSIs findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR). We pilot HistoML in representing WSIs of kidney cancer as well as thyroid carcinoma and exemplify the uses of HistoML representations in semantic queries to demonstrate the potential of HistoML-powered applications for phenotype characterization.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Here, we evaluated a test based on whole plasma peptidome acquired by MALDI-TOF-mass spectrometer and machine-learning algorithms to discriminate two lipopolysaccharide-(LPS) induced murine models emulating the pro- and anti-inflammatory/immunosuppression environments that can be found during sepsis. The LPS group was inoculated with a single high dose of LPS and the IS group was subjected to increasing doses of LPS, to induce proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory/immunosuppression profiles respectively. The LPS group showed leukopenia and higher levels of cytokines and tissue damage markers, and the IS group showed neutrophilia, lymphopenia and decreased humoral response. Principal component analysis of the plasma peptidomes formed discrete clusters that mostly coincided with the experimental groups. In addition, machine-learning algorithms discriminated the different experimental groups with a sensitivity of 95.7% and specificity of 90.9%. Data reveal the potential of plasma fingerprints analysis by MALDI-TOF-mass spectrometry as a simple, speedy and readily transferrable method for sepsis patient stratification that would contribute to therapeutic decision-making based on their immunological status.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Advantages of deep learning with convolutional neural network in detecting disc displacement of the temporomandibular joint in magnetic resonance imaging,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-15231-5,05 Jul 2022,"This study investigated the usefulness of deep learning-based automatic detection of anterior disc displacement (ADD) from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of patients with temporomandibular joint disorder (TMD). Sagittal MRI images of 2520 TMJs were collected from 861 men and 399 women (average age 37.33 ± 18.83 years). A deep learning algorithm with a convolutional neural network was developed. Data augmentation and the Adam optimizer were applied to reduce the risk of overfitting the deep-learning model. The prediction performances were compared between the models and human experts based on areas under the curve (AUCs). The fine-tuning model showed excellent prediction performance (AUC = 0.8775) and acceptable accuracy (approximately 77%). Comparing the AUC values of the from-scratch (0.8269) and freeze models (0.5858) showed lower performances of the other models compared to the fine-tuning model. In Grad-CAM visualizations, the fine-tuning scheme focused more on the TMJ disc when judging ADD, and the sparsity was higher than that of the from-scratch scheme (84.69% vs. 55.61%, p < 0.05). The three fine-tuned ensemble models using different data augmentation techniques showed a prediction accuracy of 83%. Moreover, the AUC values of ADD were higher when patients with TMD were divided by age (0.8549–0.9275) and sex (male: 0.8483, female: 0.9276). While the accuracy of the ensemble model was higher than that of human experts, the difference was not significant (p = 0.1987–0.0671). Learning from pre-trained weights allowed the fine-tuning model to outperform the from-scratch model. Another benefit of the fine-tuning model for diagnosing ADD of TMJ in Grad-CAM analysis was the deactivation of unwanted gradient values to provide clearer visualizations compared to the from-scratch model. The Grad-CAM visualizations also agreed with the model learned through important features in the joint disc area. The accuracy was further improved by an ensemble of three fine-tuning models using diversified data. The main benefits of this model were the higher specificity compared to human experts, which may be useful for preventing true negative cases, and the maintenance of its prediction accuracy across sexes and ages, suggesting a generalized prediction.",Conclusions not available,DNN,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Development and implementation of patient-level prediction models of end-stage renal disease for type 2 diabetes patients using fast healthcare interoperability resources,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-15036-6,04 Jul 2022,"This study aimed to develop a model to predict the 5-year risk of developing end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) using machine learning (ML). It also aimed to implement the developed algorithms into electronic medical records (EMR) system using Health Level Seven (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR). The final dataset used for modeling included 19,159 patients. The medical data were engineered to generate various types of features that were input into the various ML classifiers. The classifier with the best performance was XGBoost, with an area under the receiver operator characteristics curve (AUROC) of 0.95 and area under the precision recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.79 using three-fold cross-validation, compared to other models such as logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machine (AUROC range, 0.929–0.943; AUPRC 0.765–0.792). Serum creatinine, serum albumin, the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio, Charlson comorbidity index, estimated GFR, and medication days of insulin were features that were ranked high for the ESRD risk prediction. The algorithm was implemented in the EMR system using HL7 FHIR through an ML-dedicated server that preprocessed unstructured data and trained updated data.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
An ML prediction model based on clinical parameters and automated CT scan features for COVID-19 patients,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-15327-y,04 Jul 2022,"Outcome prediction for individual patient groups is of paramount importance in terms of selection of appropriate therapeutic options, risk communication to patients and families, and allocating resource through optimum triage. This has become even more necessary in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Widening the spectrum of predictor variables by including radiological parameters alongside the usually utilized demographic, clinical and biochemical ones can facilitate building a comprehensive prediction model. Automation has the potential to build such models with applications to time-critical environments so that a clinician will be able to utilize the model outcomes in real-time decision making at bedside. We show that amalgamation of computed tomogram (CT) data with clinical parameters (CP) in generating a Machine Learning model from 302 COVID-19 patients presenting to an acute care hospital in India could prognosticate the need for invasive mechanical ventilation. Models developed from CP alone, CP and radiologist derived CT severity score and CP with automated lesion-to-lung ratio had AUC of 0.87 (95% CI 0.85–0.88), 0.89 (95% CI 0.87–0.91), and 0.91 (95% CI 0.89–0.93), respectively. We show that an operating point on the ROC can be chosen to aid clinicians in risk characterization according to the resource availability and ethical considerations. This approach can be deployed in more general settings, with appropriate calibrations, to predict outcomes of severe COVID-19 patients effectively.","In conclusion, a clinicoradiological model, developed by amalgamation of radiological and clinical parameters, produced in line with the current study design, can predict important clinical outcome of need for invasive mechanical ventilation efficiently and safely. Every setting or region can use this technique to predict the outcome of severe COVID-19 patients effectively.","Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Gestational age-specific serum creatinine can predict adverse pregnancy outcomes,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-15450-w,02 Jul 2022,"Serum creatinine level (SCr) typically decreases during pregnancy due to physiologic glomerular hyperfiltration. Therefore, the clinical practice of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) based on SCr concentrations might be inapplicable to pregnant women with kidney disease since it does not take into account of the pregnancy-related biological changes. We integrated the Wonju Severance Christian Hospital (WSCH)-based findings and prior knowledge from big data to reveal the relationship between the abnormal but hidden SCr level and adverse pregnancy outcomes. We analyzed 4004 pregnant women who visited in WSCH. Adverse pregnancy outcomes included preterm birth, preeclampsia, fetal growth retardation, and intrauterine fetal demise. We categorized the pregnant women into four groups based on the gestational age (GA)-unadjusted raw distribution (Q1–4raw), and then GA-specific (Q1–4adj) SCr distribution. Linear regression analysis revealed that Q1-4adj groups had better predictive outcomes than the Q1–4raw groups. In logistic regression model, the Q1–4adj groups exhibited a robust non-linear U-shaped relationship with the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, compared to the Q1–4raw groups. The integrative analysis on SCr with respect to GA-specific distribution could be used to screen out pregnant women with a normal SCr coupled with a decreased renal function.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Utilization of dielectric properties for assessment of liver ischemia-reperfusion injury in vivo and during machine perfusion,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-14817-3,01 Jul 2022,"There is a shortage of donor livers and patients consequently die on waiting lists worldwide. Livers are discarded if they are clinically judged to have a high risk of non-function following transplantation. With the aim of extending the pool of available donor livers, we assessed the condition of porcine livers by monitoring the microwave dielectric properties. A total of 21 livers were divided into three groups: control with no injury (CON), biliary injury by hepatic artery occlusion (AHEP), and overall hepatic injury by static cold storage (SCS). All were monitored for four hours in vivo, followed by ex vivo plurithermic machine perfusion (PMP). Permittivity data was modeled with a two-pole Cole–Cole equation, and dielectric properties from one-hour intervals were analyzed during in vivo and normothermic machine perfusion (NMP). A clear increasing trend in the conductivity was observed in vivo in the AHEP livers compared to the control livers. After four hours of NMP, separations in the conductivity were observed between the three groups. Our results indicate that dielectric relaxation spectroscopy (DRS) can be used to detect and differentiate liver injuries, opening for a standardized and reliable point of evaluation for livers prior to transplantation.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

We demonstrate here the design, fabrication and testing of a 3D printed smartphone based spectroscopic device. Polarized fluorescence and elastic scattering spectra are captured through the device using a 405 nm laser and a white LED source respectively. The device has been calibrated by comparison of spectra of standard fluorophores (Flavin adenine dinucleotide, fluorescein, rhodamine, and porphyrin) with the corresponding spectra collected from a commercial spectrometer.

Spectral organ fingerprints for machine learning-based intraoperative tissue classification with hyperspectral imaging in a porcine model,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-15040-w,30 Jun 2022,"Visual discrimination of tissue during surgery can be challenging since different tissues appear similar to the human eye. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) removes this limitation by associating each pixel with high-dimensional spectral information. While previous work has shown its general potential to discriminate tissue, clinical translation has been limited due to the method’s current lack of robustness and generalizability. Specifically, the scientific community is lacking a comprehensive spectral tissue atlas, and it is unknown whether variability in spectral reflectance is primarily explained by tissue type rather than the recorded individual or specific acquisition conditions. The contribution of this work is threefold: (1) Based on an annotated medical HSI data set (9059 images from 46 pigs), we present a tissue atlas featuring spectral fingerprints of 20 different porcine organs and tissue types. (2) Using the principle of mixed model analysis, we show that the greatest source of variability related to HSI images is the organ under observation. (3) We show that HSI-based fully-automatic tissue differentiation of 20 organ classes with deep neural networks is possible with high accuracy (> 95%). We conclude from our study that automatic tissue discrimination based on HSI data is feasible and could thus aid in intraoperative decisionmaking and pave the way for context-aware computer-assisted surgery systems and autonomous robotics.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
"Multisite learning of high-dimensional heterogeneous data with applications to opioid use disorder study of 15,000 patients across 5 clinical sites",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-14029-9,30 Jun 2022,"Integrating data across institutions can improve learning efficiency. To integrate data efficiently while protecting privacy, we propose A one-shot, summary-statistics-based, Distributed Algorithm for fitting Penalized (ADAP) regression models across multiple datasets. ADAP utilizes patient-level data from a lead site and incorporates the first-order (ADAP1) and second-order gradients (ADAP2) of the objective function from collaborating sites to construct a surrogate objective function at the lead site, where model fitting is then completed with proper regularizations applied. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method using both simulation and a real-world application to study risk factors for opioid use disorder (OUD) using 15,000 patient data from the OneFlorida Clinical Research Consortium. Our results show that ADAP performs nearly the same as the pooled estimator but achieves higher estimation accuracy and better variable selection than the local and average estimators. Moreover, ADAP2 successfully handles heterogeneity in covariate distributions.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Unsupervised-learning-based method for chest MRI–CT transformation using structure constrained unsupervised generative attention networks,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-14677-x,30 Jun 2022,"The integrated positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) scanner simultaneously acquires metabolic information via PET and morphological information using MRI. However, attenuation correction, which is necessary for quantitative PET evaluation, is difficult as it requires the generation of attenuation-correction maps from MRI, which has no direct relationship with the gamma-ray attenuation information. MRI-based bone tissue segmentation is potentially available for attenuation correction in relatively rigid and fixed organs such as the head and pelvis regions. However, this is challenging for the chest region because of respiratory and cardiac motions in the chest, its anatomically complicated structure, and the thin bone cortex. We propose a new method using unsupervised generative attentional networks with adaptive layer-instance normalisation for image-to-image translation (U-GAT-IT), which specialised in unpaired image transformation based on attention maps for image transformation. We added the modality-independent neighbourhood descriptor (MIND) to the loss of U-GAT-IT to guarantee anatomical consistency in the image transformation between different domains. Our proposed method obtained a synthesised computed tomography of the chest. Experimental results showed that our method outperforms current approaches. The study findings suggest the possibility of synthesising clinically acceptable computed tomography images from chest MRI with minimal changes in anatomical structures without human annotation.","The combination of U-GAT-IT and MIND was effective in preventing anatomical inconsistencies between ZTE and synthesised CT and enabled the generation of clinically acceptable synthesised CT images. Our method also enables inter-modality image conversion in the chest region, which has been challenging to accomplish up until now without using human annotations.","DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Smartphone camera based assessment of adiposity: a validation study,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-022-00628-3,29 Jun 2022,"Body composition is a key component of health in both individuals and populations, and excess adiposity is associated with an increased risk of developing chronic diseases. Body mass index (BMI) and other clinical or commercially available tools for quantifying body fat (BF) such as DXA, MRI, CT, and photonic scanners (3DPS) are often inaccurate, cost prohibitive, or cumbersome to use. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the performance of a novel automated computer vision method, visual body composition (VBC), that uses two-dimensional photographs captured via a conventional smartphone camera to estimate percentage total body fat (%BF). The VBC algorithm is based on a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN). The hypothesis is that VBC yields better accuracy than other consumer-grade fat measurements devices. 134 healthy adults ranging in age (21–76 years), sex (61.2% women), race (60.4% White; 23.9% Black), and body mass index (BMI, 18.5–51.6 kg/m2) were evaluated at two clinical sites (N = 64 at MGH, N = 70 at PBRC). Each participant had %BF measured with VBC, three consumer and two professional bioimpedance analysis (BIA) systems. The PBRC participants also had air displacement plethysmography (ADP) measured. %BF measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was set as the reference against which all other %BF measurements were compared. To test our scientific hypothesis we run multiple, pair-wise Wilcoxon signed rank tests where we compare each competing measurement tool (VBC, BIA, …) with respect to the same ground-truth (DXA). Relative to DXA, VBC had the lowest mean absolute error and standard deviation (2.16 ± 1.54%) compared to all of the other evaluated methods (p < 0.05 for all comparisons). %BF measured by VBC also had good concordance with DXA (Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient, CCC: all 0.96; women 0.93; men 0.94), whereas BMI had very poor concordance (CCC: all 0.45; women 0.40; men 0.74). Bland-Altman analysis of VBC revealed the tightest limits of agreement (LOA) and absence of significant bias relative to DXA (bias −0.42%, R2 = 0.03; p = 0.062; LOA −5.5% to +4.7%), whereas all other evaluated methods had significant (p < 0.01) bias and wider limits of agreement. Bias in Bland-Altman analyses is defined as the discordance between the y = 0 axis and the regressed line computed from the data in the plot. In this first validation study of a novel, accessible, and easy-to-use system, VBC body fat estimates were accurate and without significant bias compared to DXA as the reference; VBC performance exceeded those of all other BIA and ADP methods evaluated. The wide availability of smartphones suggests that the VBC method for evaluating %BF could play an important role in quantifying adiposity levels in a wide range of settings.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: ; Attacker Capability: 
Impact on outcomes of mixed chimerism of bone marrow CD34+ sorted cells after matched or haploidentical allogeneic stem cell transplantation for myeloid malignancies,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41409-022-01747-x,28 Jun 2022,"Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (Allo-HSCT), proposed to patients with high-risk myeloid malignancies, may ultimately fail because of disease relapse. Bone marrow (BM) CD34+ cells in Allo-HSCT recipients can be either re-emerging recipient malignant cells or donor cells attesting of hematopoietic reconstitution. In this context, investigating donor/recipient chimerism in the population of BM CD34+ sorted cells (BM-CD34+SC) was performed in 261 Allo-HSCT recipients (matched n = 145, haploidentical n = 65, matched unrelated n = 51) with myeloid malignancies. BM-CD34+SC chimerism was compared to that of whole peripheral blood (PB) cells as well as other Allo-HSCT-related parameters, and impact on relapse and survival was assessed. Thresholds of 98% donor cells for PB and 90% for BM-CD34+SC were found to allow relapse prediction. This was completed by the application of machine learning tools to explore the predictive value of these parameters in multidimensional models with repeated iterations. BM-CD34+SC mixed chimerism stood out with all these methods as the most robust predictor of relapse with a significant impact on disease-free and overall survivals even after haploidentical Allo-HSCT and/or PTCY administration. This marker therefore appears to be of great interest for the decision of preemptive treatment to avoid post-transplant relapse.",Conclusions not available,Traditional ML,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Dynamic changes in heparin-binding protein as a prognostic biomarker for 30-day mortality in sepsis patients in the intensive care unit,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-14827-1,24 Jun 2022,"Heparin-binding protein (HBP) has been shown to be a robust predictor of the progression to organ dysfunction from sepsis, and we hypothesized that dynamic changes in HBP may reflect the severity of sepsis. We therefore aim to investigate the predictive value of baseline HBP, 24-h, and 48-h HBP change for prediction of 30-day mortality in adult patients with sepsis. This is a prospective observational study in an intensive care unit of a tertiary center. Patients aged 20 years or older who met SEPSIS-3 criteria were prospectively enrolled from August 2019 to January 2020. Plasma levels of HBP were measured at admission, 24 h, and 48 h and dynamic changes in HBP were calculated. The Primary endpoint was 30-day mortality. We tested whether the biomarkers could enhance the predictive accuracy of a multivariable predictive model. A total of 206 patients were included in the final analysis. 48-h HBP change (HBPc-48 h) had greater predictive accuracy of area under the curve (AUC: 0.82), followed by baseline HBP (0.79), PCT (0.72), lactate (0.71), and CRP (0.65), and HBPc-24 h (0.62). Incorporation of HBPc-48 h into a clinical prediction model significantly improved the AUC from 0.85 to 0.93. HBPc-48 h may assist clinicians with clinical outcome prediction in critically ill patients with sepsis and can improve the performance of a prediction model including age, SOFA score and Charlson comorbidity index.","In our single center prospective observational trial, we found that 48-h HBP change was more accurate than CRP, PCT, lactate or initial HBP level in predicting in-hospital mortality. We observed that our patients with a 48-h HBP decrease greater than 50% had a greater than 90% chance of survival, while patients with a 48-h HBP decrease less than 4% had a nearly 90% 30-day all-cause mortality rate. The HBPc-48 h can be used to enhance the predictive accuracy of a clinical prediction model. Further studies are needed to better understand the pathophysiology of elevated HBP in septic patients and how HBP measurement may potentially inform clinical care.","Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Machine learning methods to predict attrition in a population-based cohort of very preterm infants,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-13946-z,22 Jun 2022,"The timely identification of cohort participants at higher risk for attrition is important to earlier interventions and efficient use of research resources. Machine learning may have advantages over the conventional approaches to improve discrimination by analysing complex interactions among predictors. We developed predictive models of attrition applying a conventional regression model and different machine learning methods. A total of 542 very preterm (< 32 gestational weeks) infants born in Portugal as part of the European Effective Perinatal Intensive Care in Europe (EPICE) cohort were included. We tested a model with a fixed number of predictors (Baseline) and a second with a dynamic number of variables added from each follow-up (Incremental). Eight classification methods were applied: AdaBoost, Artificial Neural Networks, Functional Trees, J48, J48Consolidated, K-Nearest Neighbours, Random Forest and Logistic Regression. Performance was compared using AUC- PR (Area Under the Curve—Precision Recall), Accuracy, Sensitivity and F-measure. Attrition at the four follow-ups were, respectively: 16%, 25%, 13% and 17%. Both models demonstrated good predictive performance, AUC-PR ranging between 69 and 94.1 in Baseline and from 72.5 to 97.1 in Incremental model. Of the whole set of methods, Random Forest presented the best performance at all follow-ups [AUC-PR1: 94.1 (2.0); AUC-PR2: 91.2 (1.2); AUC-PR3: 97.1 (1.0); AUC-PR4: 96.5 (1.7)]. Logistic Regression performed well below Random Forest. The top-ranked predictors were common for both models in all follow-ups: birthweight, gestational age, maternal age, and length of hospital stay. Random Forest presented the highest capacity for prediction and provided interpretable predictors. Researchers involved in cohorts can benefit from our robust models to prepare for and prevent loss to follow-up by directing efforts toward individuals at higher risk.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Assessment of image quality on color fundus retinal images using the automatic retinal image analysis,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-13919-2,21 Jun 2022,"Image quality assessment is essential for retinopathy detection on color fundus retinal image. However, most studies focused on the classification of good and poor quality without considering the different types of poor quality. This study developed an automatic retinal image analysis (ARIA) method, incorporating transfer net ResNet50 deep network with the automatic features generation approach to automatically assess image quality, and distinguish eye-abnormality-associated-poor-quality from artefact-associated-poor-quality on color fundus retinal images. A total of 2434 retinal images, including 1439 good quality and 995 poor quality (483 eye-abnormality-associated-poor-quality and 512 artefact-associated-poor-quality), were used for training, testing, and 10-ford cross-validation. We also analyzed the external validation with the clinical diagnosis of eye abnormality as the reference standard to evaluate the performance of the method. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for testing good quality against poor quality were 98.0%, 99.1%, and 98.6%, and for differentiating between eye-abnormality-associated-poor-quality and artefact-associated-poor-quality were 92.2%, 93.8%, and 93.0%, respectively. In external validation, our method achieved an area under the ROC curve of 0.997 for the overall quality classification and 0.915 for the classification of two types of poor quality. The proposed approach, ARIA, showed good performance in testing, 10-fold cross validation and external validation. This study provides a novel angle for image quality screening based on the different poor quality types and corresponding dealing methods. It suggested that the ARIA can be used as a screening tool in the preliminary stage of retinopathy grading by telemedicine or artificial intelligence analysis.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

To classify antero-posterior knee radiographs into ‘RA’ and ‘OA-like RA’ groups, a deep learning model was developed by training the network using knee radiographs of end-stage arthropathy in RA patients obtained during 2002–2005 and in primary OA patients obtained during 2007–2009. We used this model to categorize 796 knee radiographs, which were recorded in RA patients before TKA during 2006–2020, into ‘OA-like RA’ and ‘RA’ groups. The annual ratio of ‘OA-like RA’ was investigated. Moreover, univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify the factors associated with the classification as OA-like RA using clinical data from 240 patients. The percentage of ‘OA-like RA’ had significant increasing trend from 20.9% in 2006 to 67.7% in 2020. Higher body mass index, use of biologics, and lower level of C-reactive protein were identified as independent factors for ‘OA-like RA’. An increasing trend of knee radiographs with OA-like features was observed in RA patients in the recent decades, which might be attributed to recent advances in pharmacotherapy.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Measuring collagen injury depth for burn severity determination using polarization sensitive optical coherence tomography,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-14326-3,21 Jun 2022,"Determining the optimal treatment course for a dermatologic burn wound requires knowledge of the wound’s severity, as quantified by the depth of thermal damage. In current clinical practice, burn depth is inferred based exclusively on superficial visual assessment, a method which is subject to substantial error rates in the classification of partial thickness (second degree) burns. Here, we present methods for direct, quantitative determination of the depth extent of injury to the dermal collagen matrix using polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography (PS-OCT). By visualizing the depth-dependence of the degree of polarization of light in the tissue, rather than cumulative retardation, we enable direct and volumetric assessment of local collagen status. We further augment our PS-OCT measurements by visualizing adnexal structures such as hair follicles to relay overall dermal viability in the wounded region. Our methods, which we have validated ex vivo with matched histology, offer an information-rich tool for precise interrogation of burn wound severity and healing potential in both research and clinical settings.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

We demonstrate a range of models capable of accepting flexible combinations of routinely collected clinical information, including demographics, medical history, neuropsychological testing, neuroimaging, and functional assessments. We then show that these frameworks compare favorably with the diagnostic accuracy of practicing neurologists and neuroradiologists. Lastly, we apply interpretability methods in computer vision to show that disease-specific patterns detected by our models track distinct patterns of degenerative changes throughout the brain and correspond closely with the presence of neuropathological lesions on autopsy.

Using random forest to identify longitudinal predictors of health in a 30-year cohort study,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-14632-w,20 Jun 2022,"Due to the wealth of exposome data from longitudinal cohort studies that is currently available, the need for methods to adequately analyze these data is growing. We propose an approach in which machine learning is used to identify longitudinal exposome-related predictors of health, and illustrate its potential through an application. Our application involves studying the relation between exposome and self-perceived health based on the 30-year running Doetinchem Cohort Study. Random Forest (RF) was used to identify the strongest predictors due to its favorable prediction performance in prior research. The relation between predictors and outcome was visualized with partial dependence and accumulated local effects plots. To facilitate interpretation, exposures were summarized by expressing them as the average exposure and average trend over time. The RF model’s ability to discriminate poor from good self-perceived health was acceptable (Area-Under-the-Curve = 0.707). Nine exposures from different exposome-related domains were largely responsible for the model’s performance, while 87 exposures seemed to contribute little to the performance. Our approach demonstrates that ML can be interpreted more than widely believed, and can be applied to identify important longitudinal predictors of health over the life course in studies with repeated measures of exposure. The approach is context-independent and broadly applicable.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: ; Attacker Capability:

A computerized diagnostic model for automatically evaluating placenta accrete spectrum disorders based on the combined MR radiomics-clinical signatures,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-14454-w,16 Jun 2022,"We aimed to establish a computerized diagnostic model to predict placenta accrete spectrum (PAS) disorders based on T2-weighted MR imaging. We recruited pregnant women with clinically suspected PAS disorders between January 2015 and December 2018 in our institution. All preoperative T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) MR images were manually outlined on the picture archive communication system terminal server. A nnU-Net network for automatic segmentation and the corresponding radiomics features extracted from the segmented region were applied to build a radiomics-clinical model for PAS disorders identification. Taking the surgical or pathological findings as the reference standard, we compared this computerized model’s diagnostic performance in detecting PAS disorders. In the training cohort, our model combining both radiomics and clinical characteristics yielded an accuracy of 0.771, a sensitivity of 0.854, and a specificity of 0.750 in identifying PAS disorders. In the testing cohort, this model achieved a segmentation mean Dice coefficient of 0.890 and yielded an accuracy of 0.825, a sensitivity of 0.830 and a specificity of 0.822. In the external validation cohort, this computer-aided diagnostic model yielded an accuracy of 0.690, a sensitivity of 0.929 and a specificity of 0.467 in identifying placenta increta.

Here we identify and characterize antigen-specific cells and antibody responses to the RNA vaccine BNT162b2 using multiple single-cell technologies for in depth analysis of longitudinal samples from a cohort of healthy participants. Mass cytometry and unbiased machine learning pinpoint an expanding, population of antigen-specific memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with characteristics of follicular or peripheral helper cells. B cell receptor sequencing suggest progression from IgM, with apparent cross-reactivity to endemic coronaviruses, to SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA and IgG memory B cells and plasmablasts.

Ureaplasma and Prevotella colonization with Lactobacillus abundance during pregnancy facilitates term birth,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-13871-1,16 Jun 2022,"Ureaplasma and Prevotella infections are well-known bacteria associated with preterm birth. However, with the development of metagenome sequencing techniques, it has been found that not all Ureaplasma and Prevotella colonizations cause preterm birth. The purpose of this study was to determine the association between Ureaplasma and Prevotella colonization with the induction of preterm birth even in the presence of Lactobacillus. In this matched case–control study, a total of 203 pregnant Korean women were selected and their cervicovaginal fluid samples were collected during mid-pregnancy. The microbiome profiles of the cervicovaginal fluid were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene amplification. Sequencing data were processed using QIIME1.9.1. Statistical analyses were performed using R software, and microbiome analysis was performed using the MicrobiomeAnalyst and Calypso software. A positive correlation between Ureaplasma and other genera was highly related to preterm birth, but interestingly, there was a negative correlation with Lactobacillus and term birth, with the same pattern observed with Prevotella. Ureaplasma and Prevotella colonization with Lactobacillus abundance during pregnancy facilitates term birth, although Ureaplasma and Prevotella are associated with preterm birth. Balanced colonization between Lactobacillus and Ureaplasma and Prevotella is important to prevent preterm birth.",Conclusions not available,Gen AI,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Building reliable radiomic models using image perturbation,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-14178-x,16 Jun 2022,"Radiomic model reliability is a central premise for its clinical translation. Presently, it is assessed using test–retest or external data, which, unfortunately, is often scarce in reality. Therefore, we aimed to develop a novel image perturbation-based method (IPBM) for the first of its kind toward building a reliable radiomic model. We first developed a radiomic prognostic model for head-and-neck cancer patients on a training (70%) and evaluated on a testing (30%) cohort using C-index. Subsequently, we applied the IPBM to CT images of both cohorts (Perturbed-Train and Perturbed-Test cohort) to generate 60 additional samples for both cohorts. Model reliability was assessed using intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) to quantify consistency of the C-index among the 60 samples in the Perturbed-Train and Perturbed-Test cohorts. Besides, we re-trained the radiomic model using reliable RFs exclusively (ICC > 0.75) to validate the IPBM. Results showed moderate model reliability in Perturbed-Train (ICC: 0.565, 95%CI 0.518–0.615) and Perturbed-Test (ICC: 0.596, 95%CI 0.527–0.670) cohorts. An enhanced reliability of the re-trained model was observed in Perturbed-Train (ICC: 0.782, 95%CI 0.759–0.815) and Perturbed-Test (ICC: 0.825, 95%CI 0.782–0.867) cohorts, indicating validity of the IPBM. To conclude, we demonstrated capability of the IPBM toward building reliable radiomic models, providing community with a novel model reliability assessment strategy prior to prospective evaluation.",This study proposed a radiomic model reliability assessment method using perturbations. This method identifies unreliable models by comparing the model's performance on the training dataset with the performance achieved on random perturbations of the training dataset.

Cluster analysis was performed using K-means clustering, and the variables to be included were determined by correlation network. A total of 4,370 subjects with pulmonary TB were enrolled in the study. Based on the correlation network, age and body mass index (BMI) were selected for the cluster analysis. Five clusters were identified and characterised as follows: (1) middle-aged overweight male dominance, (2) young-aged relatively female dominance without comorbidities, (3) middle-aged underweight male dominance, (4) overweight elderly with comorbidities and (5) underweight elderly with comorbidities. All clusters had distinct demographic and symptomatic characteristics. Initial microbiologic burdens and radiographic features also varied, including the presence of cavities and bilateral infiltration, which reflect TB-related severity. Cluster analysis of age and BMI identified five phenotypes of pulmonary TB with significant differences at initial clinical presentations.

Machine learning for comprehensive prediction of high risk for Alzheimer’s disease based on chromatic pupilloperimetry,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-13999-0,15 Jun 2022,"Currently there are no reliable biomarkers for early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) at the preclinical stage. This study assessed the pupil light reflex (PLR) for focal red and blue light stimuli in central and peripheral retina in 125 cognitively normal middle age subjects (45–71 years old) at high risk for AD due to a family history of the disease (FH+), and 61 age-similar subjects with no family history of AD (FH−) using Chromatic Pupilloperimetry coupled with Machine Learning (ML). All subjects had normal ophthalmic assessment, and normal retinal and optic nerve thickness by optical coherence tomography. No significant differences were observed between groups in cognitive function and volumetric brain MRI. Chromatic pupilloperimetry-based ML models were highly discriminative in differentiating subjects with and without AD family history, using transient PLR for focal red (primarily cone-mediated), and dim blue (primarily rod-mediated) light stimuli. Features associated with transient pupil response latency (PRL) achieved Area Under the Curve Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUC-ROC) of 0.90 ± 0.051 (left-eye) and 0.87 ± 0.048 (right-eye). Parameters associated with the contraction arm of the rod and cone-mediated PLR were more discriminative compared to parameters associated with the relaxation arm and melanopsin-mediated PLR. Significantly shorter PRL for dim blue light was measured in the FH+ group in two test targets in the temporal visual field in right eye that had highest relative weight in the ML algorithm (mean ± standard error, SE 0.449 s ± 0.007 s vs. 0.478 s ± 0.010 s, p = 0.038). Taken together our study suggests that subtle focal changes in pupil contraction latency may be detected in subjects at high risk to develop AD, decades before the onset of AD clinical symptoms. The dendrites of melanopsin containing retinal ganglion cells may be affected very early at the preclinical stages of AD.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Small-molecule metabolome identifies potential therapeutic targets against COVID-19,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-14050-y,15 Jun 2022,"Respiratory viruses are transmitted and acquired via the nasal mucosa, and thereby may influence the nasal metabolome composed of biochemical products produced by both host cells and microbes. Studies of the nasal metabolome demonstrate virus-specific changes that sometimes correlate with viral load and disease severity. Here, we evaluate the nasopharyngeal metabolome of COVID-19 infected individuals and report several small molecules that may be used as potential therapeutic targets. Specimens were tested by qRT-PCR with target primers for three viruses: Influenza A (INFA), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and SARS-CoV-2, along with unaffected controls. The nasopharyngeal metabolome was characterized using an LC–MS/MS-based screening kit capable of quantifying 141 analytes. A machine learning model identified 28 discriminating analytes and correctly categorized patients with a viral infection with an accuracy of 96% (R2 = 0.771, Q2 = 0.72). A second model identified 5 analytes to differentiate COVID19-infected patients from those with INFA or RSV with an accuracy of 85% (R2 = 0.442, Q2 = 0.301). Specifically, Lysophosphatidylcholines-a-C18:2 (LysoPCaC18:2) concentration was significantly increased in COVID19 patients (P < 0.0001), whereas beta-hydroxybutyric acid, Methionine sulfoxide, succinic acid, and carnosine concentrations were significantly decreased (P < 0.0001).

Regression models were used to predict patients’ Bayesian 5-min ECG Heart Ages from their standard, resting 10-s 12-lead ECGs. The difference between 5-min and 10-s ECG Heart Ages were analyzed, as were the differences between 10-s ECG Heart Age and the chronological age (the Heart Age Gap). In total, 2,771 subjects were included (n = 1682 healthy volunteers, n = 305 with cardiovascular risk factors, n = 784 with cardiovascular disease). Overall, 10-s Heart Age showed strong agreement with the 5-min Heart Age (R2 = 0.94, p < 0.001, mean ± SD bias 0.0 ± 5.1 years).

"Association of FXI activity with thrombo-inflammation, extracellular matrix, lipid metabolism and apoptosis in venous thrombosis",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-13174-5,13 Jun 2022,"Animal experiments and early phase human trials suggest that inhibition of factor XIa (FXIa) safely prevents venous thromboembolism (VTE), and specific murine models of sepsis have shown potential efficacy in alleviating cytokine storm. These latter findings support the role of FXI beyond coagulation. Here, we combine targeted proteomics, machine learning and bioinformatics, to discover associations between FXI activity (FXI:C) and the plasma protein profile of patients with VTE. FXI:C was measured with a modified activated partial prothrombin time (APTT) clotting time assay. Proximity extension assay-based protein profiling was performed on plasma collected from subjects from the Genotyping and Molecular Phenotyping of Venous Thromboembolism (GMP-VTE) Project, collected during an acute VTE event (n = 549) and 12-months after (n = 187). Among 444 proteins investigated, N = 21 and N = 66 were associated with FXI:C during the acute VTE event and at 12 months follow-up, respectively. Seven proteins were identified as FXI:C-associated at both time points. These FXI-related proteins were enriched in immune pathways related to causes of thrombo-inflammation, extracellular matrix interaction, lipid metabolism, and apoptosis. The results of this study offer important new avenues for future research into the multiple properties of FXI, which are of high clinical interest given the current development of FXI inhibitors.","This study reports the associations between FXI:C and an extensive set of plasma proteins in the clinical setting of venous thrombosis by exploratory high-throughput targeted proteomics. The identified FXI-associated proteins are involved in several known pathways related to specific causes of thrombo-inflammation such as IL-1, NF-κβ and TLR4 signalling pathways, in addition to relevant mechanisms including apoptosis and tissue remodelling. Given its complex interactions with the immune system, inhibition of FXI could induce a host of pleiotropic effects beyond inhibition of coagulation. Future studies should validate and determine the clinical relevance of these findings, especially to define the optimal clinical use of FXI inhibitors.","Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Deep neural network trained on gigapixel images improves lymph node metastasis detection in clinical settings,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-30746-1,10 Jun 2022,"The pathological identification of lymph node (LN) metastasis is demanding and tedious. Although convolutional neural networks (CNNs) possess considerable potential in improving the process, the ultrahigh-resolution of whole slide images hinders the development of a clinically applicable solution. We design an artificial-intelligence-assisted LN assessment workflow to facilitate the routine counting of metastatic LNs. Unlike previous patch-based approaches, our proposed method trains CNNs by using 5-gigapixel images, obviating the need for lesion-level annotations. Trained on 5907 LN images, our algorithm identifies metastatic LNs in gastric cancer with a slide-level area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.9936. Clinical experiments reveal that the workflow significantly improves the sensitivity of micrometastasis identification (81.94% to 95.83%, P < .001) and isolated tumor cells (67.95% to 96.15%, P < .001) in a significantly shorter review time (−31.5%, P < .001).

Defining brain-based OCD patient profiles using task-based fMRI and unsupervised machine learning,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41386-022-01353-x,09 Jun 2022,"While much research has highlighted phenotypic heterogeneity in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), less work has focused on heterogeneity in neural activity. Conventional neuroimaging approaches rely on group averages that assume homogenous patient populations. If subgroups are present, these approaches can increase variability and can lead to discrepancies in the literature. They can also obscure differences between various subgroups. To address this issue, we used unsupervised machine learning to identify subgroup clusters of patients with OCD who were assessed by task-based fMRI. We predominantly focused on activation of cognitive control and performance monitoring neurocircuits, including three large-scale brain networks that have been implicated in OCD (the frontoparietal network, cingulo-opercular network, and default mode network). Participants were patients with OCD (n = 128) that included both adults (ages 24–45) and adolescents (ages 12–17), as well as unaffected controls (n = 64). Neural assessments included tests of cognitive interference and error processing. We found three patient clusters, reflecting a “normative” cluster that shared a brain activation pattern with unaffected controls (65.9% of clinical participants), as well as an “interference hyperactivity” cluster (15.2% of clinical participants) and an “error hyperactivity” cluster (18.9% of clinical participants). We also related these clusters to demographic and clinical correlates. After post-hoc correction for false discovery rates, the interference hyperactivity cluster showed significantly longer reaction times than the other patient clusters, but no other between-cluster differences in covariates were detected. These findings increase precision in patient characterization, reframe prior neurobehavioral research in OCD, and provide a starting point for neuroimaging-guided treatment selection.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
A new generative adversarial network for medical images super resolution,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-13658-4,09 Jun 2022,"For medical image analysis, there is always an immense need for rich details in an image. Typically, the diagnosis will be served best if the fine details in the image are retained and the image is available in high resolution. In medical imaging, acquiring high-resolution images is challenging and costly as it requires sophisticated and expensive instruments, trained human resources, and often causes operation delays. Deep learning based super resolution techniques can help us to extract rich details from a low-resolution image acquired using the existing devices. In this paper, we propose a new Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based architecture for medical images, which maps low-resolution medical images to high-resolution images. The proposed architecture is divided into three steps. In the first step, we use a multi-path architecture to extract shallow features on multiple scales instead of single scale. In the second step, we use a ResNet34 architecture to extract deep features and upscale the features map by a factor of two. In the third step, we extract features of the upscaled version of the image using a residual connection-based mini-CNN and again upscale the feature map by a factor of two. The progressive upscaling overcomes the limitation for previous methods in generating true colors. Finally, we use a reconstruction convolutional layer to map back the upscaled features to a high-resolution image. Our addition of an extra loss term helps in overcoming large errors, thus, generating more realistic and smooth images. We evaluate the proposed architecture on four different medical image modalities: (1) the DRIVE and STARE datasets of retinal fundoscopy images, (2) the BraTS dataset of brain MRI, (3) the ISIC skin cancer dataset of dermoscopy images, and (4) the CAMUS dataset of cardiac ultrasound images. The proposed architecture achieves superior accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art super-resolution architectures.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: ; Attacker Capability:

Predicting biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer with artificial intelligence,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-022-00126-3,08 Jun 2022,"The first sign of metastatic prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy is rising PSA levels in the blood, termed biochemical recurrence. The prediction of recurrence relies mainly on the morphological assessment of prostate cancer using the Gleason grading system. However, in this system, within-grade morphological patterns and subtle histopathological features are currently omitted, leaving a significant amount of prognostic potential unexplored.","In summary, we have developed a deep-learning-based visual biomarker for prostate cancer recurrence based on tissue microarray hotspots of prostatectomies. The DLS marker provides a continuous score predicting the speed of biochemical recurrence. We obtained an odds ratio of 3.32 (CI 1.63–6.77; p = 0.001) for a nested case-control study from Johns Hopkins Hospital, matched on Gleason sum on other factors. Additionally, we obtained an HR of 3.02 (CI 1.10–8.29; p = 0.03) for an external validation cohort from the New York Langone hospital, adjusted for ISUP grade, pathological stage, preoperative PSA concentration, and surgical margins status. Thus, this visual biomarker may provide prognostic information in addition to the current morphological ISUP grade.","Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Assessment of liver cirrhosis severity with extracellular volume fraction MRI,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-13340-9,08 Jun 2022,"We aimed to investigate the diagnostic utility of MRI extracellular volume fraction (ECV) for the assessment of liver cirrhosis severity as defined by Child–Pugh class. In this retrospective study, 90 patients (68 cirrhotic patients and 22 controls), who underwent multiparametric liver MRI, were identified. Hepatic T1 relaxation times and ECV were assessed. Clinical scores of liver disease severity were calculated. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test, Spearman’s correlation coefficient, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis were used for statistical analysis. In cirrhotic patients, hepatic native T1 increased depending on Child–Pugh class (620.5 ± 78.9 ms (Child A) vs. 666.6 ± 73.4 ms (Child B) vs. 828.4 ± 91.2 ms (Child C), P < 0.001). ECV was higher in cirrhotic patients compared to the controls (40.1 ± 11.9% vs. 25.9 ± 4.5%, P < 0.001) and increased depending of Child–Pugh class (33.3 ± 6.0% (Child A) vs. 39.6 ± 4.9% (Child B) vs. 52.8 ± 1.2% (Child C), P < 0.001). ECV correlated with Child–Pugh score (r = 0.64, P < 0.001). ECV allowed differentiating between Child–Pugh classes A and B, and B and C with an AUC of 0.785 and 0.944 (P < 0.001, respectively). The diagnostic performance of ECV for differentiating between Child–Pugh classes A and B, and B and C was higher compared to hepatic native T1 (AUC: 0.651 and 0.910) and MELD score (AUC: 0.740 and 0.795) (P < 0.05, respectively). MRI-derived ECV correlated with Child–Pugh score and had a high diagnostic performance for the discrimination of different Child–Pugh classes. ECV might become a valuable non-invasive biomarker for the assessment of liver cirrhosis severity.",Conclusions not available,Gen AI,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Machine learning generalizability across healthcare settings: insights from multi-site COVID-19 screening,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-022-00614-9,07 Jun 2022,"As patient health information is highly regulated due to privacy concerns, most machine learning (ML)-based healthcare studies are unable to test on external patient cohorts, resulting in a gap between locally reported model performance and cross-site generalizability. Different approaches have been introduced for developing models across multiple clinical sites, however less attention has been given to adopting ready-made models in new settings. We introduce three methods to do this—(1) applying a ready-made model “as-is” (2); readjusting the decision threshold on the model’s output using site-specific data and (3); finetuning the model using site-specific data via transfer learning. Using a case study of COVID-19 diagnosis across four NHS Hospital Trusts, we show that all methods achieve clinically-effective performances (NPV > 0.959), with transfer learning achieving the best results (mean AUROCs between 0.870 and 0.925). Our models demonstrate that site-specific customization improves predictive performance when compared to other ready-made approaches.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Predicting persistent central serous chorioretinopathy using multiple optical coherence tomographic images by deep learning,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-13473-x,04 Jun 2022,"We sought to predict whether central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) will persist after 6 months using multiple optical coherence tomography (OCT) images by deep convolutional neural network (CNN). This was a multicenter, retrospective, cohort study. Multiple OCT images, including B-scan and en face images of retinal thickness (RT), mid-retina, ellipsoid zone (EZ) layer, and choroidal layer, were collected from 832 eyes of 832 CSC patients (593 self-resolving and 239 persistent). Each image set and concatenated set were divided into training (70%), validation (15%), and test (15%) sets. Training and validation were performed using ResNet50 CNN architecture for predicting CSC requiring treatment. Model performance was analyzed using the test set. The accuracy of prediction was 0.8072, 0.9200, 0.6480, and 0.9200 for B-scan, RT, mid-retina, EZ, and choroid modalities, respectively. When image sets with high accuracy were concatenated, the accuracy was 0.9520, 0.8800, and 0.9280 for B-scan + RT, B-scan + EZ, and EZ + RT, respectively. OCT B-scan, RT, and EZ en face images demonstrated good performances for predicting the prognosis of CSC using CNN. The performance improved when these sets were concatenated. The results of this study can serve as a reference for choosing an optimal treatment for CSC patients.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Prenatal stress perturbs fetal iron homeostasis in a sex specific manner,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-13633-z,04 Jun 2022,"The adverse effects of maternal prenatal stress (PS) on child’s neurodevelopment warrant the establishment of biomarkers that enable early interventional therapeutic strategies. We performed a prospective matched double cohort study screening 2000 pregnant women in third trimester with Cohen Perceived Stress Scale-10 (PSS-10) questionnaire; 164 participants were recruited and classified as stressed and control group (SG, CG). Fetal cord blood iron parameters of 107 patients were measured at birth. Transabdominal electrocardiograms-based Fetal Stress Index (FSI) was derived. We investigated sex contribution to group differences and conducted causal inference analyses to assess the total effect of PS exposure on iron homeostasis using a directed acyclic graph (DAG) approach. Differences are reported for p < 0.05 unless noted otherwise. Transferrin saturation was lower in male stressed neonates. The minimum adjustment set of the DAG to estimate the total effect of PS exposure on fetal ferritin iron biomarkers consisted of maternal age and socioeconomic status: SG revealed a 15% decrease in fetal ferritin compared with CG. Mean FSI was higher among SG than among CG. FSI-based timely detection of fetuses affected by PS can support early individualized iron supplementation and neurodevelopmental follow-up to prevent long-term sequelae due to PS-exacerbated impairment of the iron homeostasis.","We show that during third trimester PS exerts a sex-dependent effect on fetal iron homeostasis and on the fetal ANS measured by FSI, an ECG-derived measure of chronic stress transfer from mother to fetus. The reported biomarkers open novel avenues of research into the association between PS and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. They can contribute to development of novel therapeutic intervention strategies39,40.We propose the following aspects of future research: First, do the changes we report represent a healthy or maladaptive response to PS? Second, will applying FSI monitoring during pregnancy permit to track a “deviating neurodevelopmental trajectory” and when exactly during gestation do these changes occur? The non-invasive fetal monitoring with FSI tracking may help answer these questions. Third, what is the significance and therapeutic opportunity of the discovery that PS can impact fetal iron homeostasis? Do female fetuses possess more successful compensatory mechanisms in response to PS than males do? The sex-specific effects of this impact warrant further investigations. Fourth, which role may iron supplementation play in this context as a corrective therapeutic option2,41? Our findings indicate that we will need to consider the sex when devising therapeutic strategies to compensate for the intrauterine adversity due to PS42.","Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Empirical analyses and simulations showed that different machine and statistical learning methods had differing performance for predicting blood pressure,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-13015-5,03 Jun 2022,"Machine learning is increasingly being used to predict clinical outcomes. Most comparisons of different methods have been based on empirical analyses in specific datasets. We used Monte Carlo simulations to determine when machine learning methods perform better than statistical learning methods in a specific setting. We evaluated six learning methods: stochastic gradient boosting machines using trees as the base learners, random forests, artificial neural networks, the lasso, ridge regression, and linear regression estimated using ordinary least squares (OLS). Our simulations were informed by empirical analyses in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and congestive heart failure (CHF) and used six data-generating processes, each based on one of the six learning methods, to simulate continuous outcomes in the derivation and validation samples. The outcome was systolic blood pressure at hospital discharge, a continuous outcome. We applied the six learning methods in each of the simulated derivation samples and evaluated performance in the simulated validation samples. The primary observation was that neural networks tended to result in estimates with worse predictive accuracy than the other five methods in both disease samples and across all six data-generating processes. Boosted trees and OLS regression tended to perform well across a range of scenarios.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Low expression of IGFBP4 and TAGLN accelerate the poor overall survival of osteosarcoma,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-13163-8,03 Jun 2022,"Osteosarcoma is a common malignant bone tumor characterized by the production of osteoid stroma by the tumor. However, effect of IGFBP4 and TAGLN on the survival of osteosarcoma is unclear. The GEO database was used to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between control samples and osteosarcoma. Genes for biological process (BP), cellular composition (CC), and molecular function (MF) were examined using DAVID, Metascape, and GSEA. GSE14359 and GSE36001 were downloaded in the GEO database. GEO2R was used to find DEGs between control samples and osteosarcoma. The cytoHubb also found the hub genes of IGFBP4 and TAGLN. The Kaplan–Meier method was used to analyze overall survival. A total of 134 patients with osteosarcoma were enrolled in this study. The RNA levels of IGFBP4 and TAGLN were evaluated by RT-qPCR. The correlation between IGFBP4 and TAGLN expression and their associations with clinical indicators were analyzed using Spearman's rho test and Pearson's Chi-squared test. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to determine the potential prognostic factors. And the animal model was used to verify the role of hub genes on the osteosarcoma by the RT-qPCR and immunofluorescence. Support Vector Machine (SVM) was performed to construct the correlation among the expression of IGFBP4, TAGLN, and osteosarcoma. Through bioinformatics, IGFBP4 and TAGLN were identified as the hub genes of osteosarcoma. And osteosarcoma patients with high expression levels of IGFBP4 (HR = 0.56, P = 0.013) and TAGLN (HR = 0.52, P = 0.012) had better overall survival times than those with low expression levels. The results showed that pathologic grade (P = 0.017), tumor metastasis (P < 0.001), and enneking stage (P < 0.001) were significantly correlated with IGFBP4. Also, pathologic grade (P = 0.002), tumor metastasis (P < 0.001), and enneking stage (P < 0.001) were significantly related to the TAGLN. Spearman’s correlation coefficient displayed that IGFBP4 were significantly correlated with the tumor metastasis (ρ = − 0.843, P < 0.001), enneking stage (ρ = − 0.500, P < 0.001), and TAGLN (ρ = 0.821, P < 0.001). IGFBP4 (HR = 0.252, 95% CI 0.122–0.517, P < 0.001) and TAGLN (HR = 0.155, 95% CI 0.089–0.269, P < 0.001) were significantly associated with overall survival. Based on the qPCR and immunofluorescence, IGFBP4 and TAGLN were down-regulated in the osteosarcoma tissue than the control group. And the SVM presented that there exists strong relationship among the expression of IGFBP4, TAGLN, and osteosarcoma. IGFBP4 and TAGLN may be attractive molecular targets for osteosarcoma, opening a new avenue for research into the disease.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Using generative adversarial networks for genome variant calling from low depth ONT sequencing data,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-12346-7,30 May 2022,"Genome variant calling is a challenging yet critical task for subsequent studies. Existing methods almost rely on high depth DNA sequencing data. Performance on low depth data drops a lot. Using public Oxford Nanopore (ONT) data of human being from the Genome in a Bottle (GIAB) Consortium, we trained a generative adversarial network for low depth variant calling. Our method, noted as LDV-Caller, can project high depth sequencing information from low depth data. It achieves 94.25% F1 score on low depth data, while the F1 score of the state-of-the-art method on two times higher depth data is 94.49%. By doing so, the price of genome-wide sequencing examination can reduce deeply. In addition, we validated the trained LDV-Caller model on 157 public Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) samples. The mean sequencing depth of these samples is 2982. The LDV-Caller yields 92.77% F1 score using only 22x sequencing depth, which demonstrates our method has potential to analyze different species with only low depth sequencing data.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: ; Attacker Capability: 
Identification and epidemiological characterization of Type-2 diabetes sub-population using an unsupervised machine learning approach,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41387-022-00206-2,27 May 2022,"Studies on Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) have revealed heterogeneous sub-populations in terms of underlying pathologies. However, the identification of sub-populations in epidemiological datasets remains unexplored. We here focus on the detection of T2DM clusters in epidemiological data, specifically analysing the National Family Health Survey-4 (NFHS-4) dataset from India containing a wide spectrum of features, including medical history, dietary and addiction habits, socio-economic and lifestyle patterns of 10,125 T2DM patients.","From a data science perspective, this analysis addresses the issue of diverse data types. We have shown that for such data conventional application of dimension reduction approaches might not be fruitful. We develop a workflow that contributes to finding meaningful and interpretable clusters such that the distribution of clusters is not biased by the data types.The existence of a significant non-obese T2DM patient sub-population belonging to a younger age group and having larger proportions of rural residents raise a lower quality of life, indicating the need for different screening criteria for T2DM among rural Indian residents.

Outcome prediction for acute kidney injury among hospitalized children via eXtreme Gradient Boosting algorithm,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-13152-x,27 May 2022,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common among hospitalized children and is associated with a poor prognosis. The study sought to develop machine learning-based models for predicting adverse outcomes among hospitalized AKI children. We performed a retrospective study of hospitalized AKI patients aged 1 month to 18 years in the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University in China from 2015 to 2020. The primary outcomes included major adverse kidney events within 30 days (MAKE30) (death, new renal replacement therapy, and persistent renal dysfunction) and 90-day adverse outcomes (chronic dialysis and death). The state-of-the-art machine learning algorithm, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and the traditional logistic regression were used to establish prediction models for MAKE30 and 90-day adverse outcomes. The models’ performance was evaluated by split-set test. A total of 1394 pediatric AKI patients were included in the study. The incidence of MAKE30 and 90-day adverse outcomes was 24.1% and 8.1%, respectively. In the test set, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the XGBoost model was 0.810 (95% CI 0.763–0.857) for MAKE30 and 0.851 (95% CI 0.785–0.916) for 90-day adverse outcomes, The AUC of the logistic regression model was 0.786 (95% CI 0.731–0.841) for MAKE30 and 0.759 (95% CI 0.654–0.864) for 90-day adverse outcomes. A web-based risk calculator can facilitate the application of the XGBoost models in daily clinical practice. In conclusion, XGBoost showed good performance in predicting MAKE30 and 90-day adverse outcomes, which provided clinicians with useful tools for prognostic assessment in hospitalized AKI children.","In conclusion, we determined the incidence and outcomes of AKI among hospitalized children and developed machine learning-based prediction models for MAKE30 and 90-day adverse outcomes using the XGBoost algorithm.

Development of a deep learning model that predicts Bi-level positive airway pressure failure,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-12984-x,26 May 2022,"Delaying intubation for patients failing Bi-Level Positive Airway Pressure (BIPAP) may be associated with harm. The objective of this study was to develop a deep learning model capable of aiding clinical decision making by predicting Bi-Level Positive Airway Pressure (BIPAP) failure. This was a retrospective cohort study in a tertiary pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) between 2010 and 2020. Three machine learning models were developed to predict BIPAP failure: two logistic regression models and one deep learning model, a recurrent neural network with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM-RNN) architecture. Model performance was evaluated in a holdout test set. 175 (27.7%) of 630 total BIPAP sessions were BIPAP failures. Patients in the BIPAP failure group were on BIPAP for a median of 32.8 (9.2–91.3) hours prior to intubation. Late BIPAP failure (intubation after using BIPAP > 24 h) patients had fewer 28-day Ventilator Free Days (13.40 [0.68–20.96]), longer ICU length of stay and more post-extubation BIPAP days compared to those who were intubated ≤ 24 h from BIPAP initiation. An AUROC above 0.5 indicates that a model has extracted new information, potentially valuable to the clinical team, about BIPAP failure. Within 6 h of BIPAP initiation, the LSTM-RNN model predicted which patients were likely to fail BIPAP with an AUROC of 0.81 (0.80, 0.82), superior to all other models. Within 6 h of BIPAP initiation, the LSTM-RNN model would identify nearly 80% of BIPAP failures with a 50% false alarm rate, equal to an NNA of 2. In conclusion, a deep learning method using readily available data from the electronic health record can identify which patients on BIPAP are likely to fail with good discrimination, oftentimes days before they are intubated in usual practice.","A machine learning model using electronic health record data from children on BIPAP can identify children with high likelihood of failing BIPAP, with a relatively modest false alarm rate. We suggest external validation of this model in additional ICUs to test its generalizability, followed by a clinical trial to determine if it results in improved outcomes for children with acute respiratory failure on BIPAP.","Traditional ML, DNN",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Learning models for forecasting hospital resource utilization for COVID-19 patients in Canada,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-12491-z,24 May 2022,"Hospitals in Canada are facing a crisis-level shortage of critical supplies and equipment during the COVID-19 pandemic. This motivates us to create predictive models that can use Canada COVID-19 data and pandemic-related factors to accurately forecast 5 quantities—three related to hospital resource utilization (i.e., the number of hospital beds, ICU beds, and ventilators that will be needed by COVID-19 patients) and two to the pandemic progress (i.e., the number of COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 deaths)—several weeks in advance. We developed a machine learning method that can use information (i.e., resource utilization, pandemic progress, population mobility, weather condition, and public policy) currently known about a region since March 2020, to learn multiple temporal convolutional network (TCN) models every week; each used for forecasting the weekly average of one of these 5 quantities in Canada (respectively, in six specific provinces) for each, in the next 1 (resp., 2,3,4) weeks. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we compared our method, versus other standard models, on the COVID-19 data and hospital resource data, on the tasks of predicting the 116 values (for Canada and its six most populated provinces), every week from Oct 2020 to July 2021, and the 20 values (only for Canada) for four specific times within 9 July to 31 Dec 2021. Experimental results show that our 4640 TCN models (each forecasting a regional target for a specific future time, on a specific date) can produce accurate 1,2,3,4-week forecasts of the utilization of every hospital resource and pandemic progress for each week from 2 Oct 2020 to 2 July 2021, as well as 80 TCN models for each of the four specified times within 9 July and 31 Dec 2021. Compared to other baseline and state-of-the-art predictive models, our TCN models yielded the best forecasts, with the lowest mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Additional experiments, on the IHME COVID-19 data, demonstrate the effectiveness of our TCN models, in comparison with IHME forecasts. Each of our TCN models used a pre-defined set of features; we experimentally validate the effectiveness of these features by showing that these models perform better than other models that instead used other features. Overall, these experimental results demonstrate that our method can accurately forecast hospital resource utilization and pandemic progress for Canada and for each of the six provinces.","This paper provided a method that learns TCN-models that can forecast many useful healthcare quantities, including the need for hospital beds, ICU beds, and ventilators. These models incorporate the complex interplay of many factors—including regional mobility, weather, and public policy—to produce accurate forecasts that can help decision-makers make effective, accurate decisions. We have provided a method for effectively learning these TCN models for various target-region, and horizon-specific forecasts, including the weekly average number of hospital beds, ICU beds, ventilators, cases, and deaths in Canada and six provinces (AB, BC, MB, ON, QC, SK) for up-to-4 weeks in the future. The numerous experiments demonstrated that our method is more accurate (in terms of MAPE) than four state-of-the-art predictive models. We also demonstrated that our method can accurately forecast the weekly average number of cases and deaths in the future.","DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Cross-sectional metabolic subgroups and 10-year follow-up of cardiometabolic multimorbidity in the UK Biobank,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-12198-1,21 May 2022,"We assigned 329,908 UK Biobank participants into six subgroups based on a self-organizing map of 51 biochemical measures (blinded for clinical outcomes). The subgroup with the most favorable metabolic traits was chosen as the reference. Hazard ratios (HR) for incident disease were modeled by Cox regression. Enrichment ratios (ER) of incident multi-morbidity versus randomly expected co-occurrence were evaluated by permutation tests; ER is like HR but captures co-occurrence rather than event frequency. The subgroup with high urinary excretion without kidney stress (HR = 1.24) and the subgroup with the highest apolipoprotein B and blood pressure (HR = 1.52) were associated with ischemic heart disease (IHD). The subgroup with kidney stress, high adiposity and inflammation was associated with IHD (HR = 2.11), cancer (HR = 1.29), dementia (HR = 1.70) and mortality (HR = 2.12). The subgroup with high liver enzymes and triglycerides was at risk of diabetes (HR = 15.6). Multimorbidity was enriched in metabolically favorable subgroups (3.4 ≤ ER ≤ 4.0) despite lower disease burden overall; the relative risk of co-occurring disease was higher in the absence of obvious metabolic dysfunction. These results provide synergistic insight into metabolic health and its associations with cardiovascular disease in a large population sample.","The SOM subtypes provided a descriptive framework of how combinations of multiple risk factors are associated with diverging cardiometabolic disease outcomes within a population. The new information is useful for the development of targeted interventions for specific subgroups; potential applications include phenotypically guided trials of new treatments where participants are selected based on their full phenotypic profile (e.g. cardiovascular drug trials designed for persons with inflammatory kidney stress vs. persons with diabetogenic liver stress). Such designs will provide more targeted information on the exact type of patient who will benefit the most from the treatment. We also see potential to adopt metabolic profiles as a new approach to assess the health and aggregate disease burden in a population. For example, subtype prevalences can provide phenotypically specific information on how changes in environmental risk factors influence the aggregate disease burden in different segments of the population over time.","Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Approximately 40% of patients do not respond to individual biologic therapies and 5–20% are refractory to all. In a biopsy-based, precision-medicine, randomized clinical trial in RA (R4RA; n = 164), patients with low/absent synovial B cell molecular signature had a lower response to rituximab (anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody) compared with that to tocilizumab (anti-IL6R monoclonal antibody) although the exact mechanisms of response/nonresponse remain to be established. Here, in-depth histological/molecular analyses of R4RA synovial biopsies identify humoral immune response gene signatures associated with response to rituximab and tocilizumab, and a stromal/fibroblast signature in patients refractory to all medications. Post-treatment changes in synovial gene expression and cell infiltration highlighted divergent effects of rituximab and tocilizumab relating to differing response/nonresponse mechanisms. Using ten-by-tenfold nested cross-validation, we developed machine learning algorithms predictive of response to rituximab (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.74), tocilizumab (AUC = 0.68) and, notably, multidrug resistance (AUC = 0.69). This study supports the notion that disease endotypes, driven by diverse molecular pathology pathways in the diseased tissue, determine diverse clinical and treatment–response phenotypes. It also highlights the importance of integration of molecular pathology signatures into clinical algorithms to optimize the future use of existing medications and inform the development of new drugs for refractory patients.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
CT-based deep learning enables early postoperative recurrence prediction for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-12604-8,19 May 2022,"Preoperatively accurate evaluation of risk for early postoperative recurrence contributes to maximizing the therapeutic success for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) patients. This study aimed to investigate the potential of deep learning (DL) algorithms for predicting postoperative early recurrence through the use of preoperative images. We collected the dataset, including preoperative plain computed tomography (CT) images, from 41 patients undergoing curative surgery for iCCA at multiple institutions. We built a CT patch-based predictive model using a residual convolutional neural network and used fivefold cross-validation. The prediction accuracy of the model was analyzed. We defined early recurrence as recurrence within a year after surgical resection. Of the 41 patients, early recurrence was observed in 20 (48.8%). A total of 71,081 patches were extracted from the entire segmented tumor area of each patient. The average accuracy of the ResNet model for predicting early recurrence was 98.2% for the training dataset. In the validation dataset, the average sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 97.8%, 94.0%, and 96.5%, respectively. Furthermore, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.994. Our CT-based DL model exhibited high predictive performance in projecting postoperative early recurrence, proposing a novel insight into iCCA management.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Detection of cognitive decline by spinal posture assessment in health exams of the general older population,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-12605-7,19 May 2022,"The recent increase in the older adult population has led to a higher prevalence of cognitive impairment, which is often overlooked in routine health examinations. Citizens aged 50–89 years were targeted for this cohort survey by random sampling from the resident registry of a cooperating town in 2014. A total of 411 participants (202 male and 209 female) were enrolled. We analyzed the distribution of cognitive function test scores as determined by Montreal Cognitive Assessment and Mini-Mental State Examination tests in each age (50’s, 60’s, 70’s and 80’s) and sex group to examine whether cognitive decline could be detected by sagittal spinal balance measurement based on a radiological approach. Sagittal spinal balance was quantitatively measured as sagittal vertical axis (SVA). We observed significant associations for higher age and/or SVA anteriorization with lower cognitive function. In males, spinal balance anteriorization was associated with cognitive decline independently of age, with combinations of age and SVA also making valid cognitive decline determinations; male cases of SVA ≥ 100 mm at any age, SVA ≥ 90 mm at ≥ 70 years, and SVA ≥ 70 mm at ≥ 80 years were all more likely to have cognitive decline than cases below those values. For females, cognitive decline was more likely in cases of SVA ≥ 70 mm, regardless of age. Thus, spinal balance anteriorization can be regarded as an easily visible indicator of latent cognitive decline in community-dwelling older people.",Conclusions not available,Gen AI,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Subchondral tibial bone texture of conventional X-rays predicts total knee arthroplasty,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-12083-x,18 May 2022,"Lacking disease-modifying osteoarthritis drugs (DMOADs) for knee osteoarthritis (KOA), Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) is often considered an important clinical outcome. Thus, it is important to determine the most relevant factors that are associated with the risk of TKA. The present study aims to develop a model based on a combination of X-ray trabecular bone texture (TBT) analysis, and clinical and radiological information to predict TKA risk in patients with or at risk of developing KOA. This study involved 4382 radiographs, obtained from the OsteoArthritis Initiative (OAI) cohort. Cases were defined as patients with TKA on at least one knee prior to the 108-month follow-up time point and controls were defined as patients who had never undergone TKA. The proposed TKA-risk prediction model, combining TBT parameters and Kellgren–Lawrence (KL) grades, was performed using logistic regression. The proposed model achieved an AUC of 0.92 (95% Confidence Interval [CI] 0.90, 0.93), while the KL model achieved an AUC of 0.86 (95% CI 0.84, 0.86; p < 0.001). This study presents a new TKA prediction model with a good performance permitting the identification of at risk patient with a good sensitivy and specificity, with a 60% increase in TKA case prediction as reflected by the recall values.","The model presented in this study, involving TBT analysis of conventional knee radiographs associated with radiological scoring (KL scores), improves the long-term prediction of TKA risk in patients with KOA.The clinical decision-making process in TKA is complex53. Early detection and assessment of KOA prognostic factors are crucial for developing management and treatments that aim at preventing irreversible damage to the knee joint leading to arthroplasty. Identifying the most at-risk patients who may undergo total knee arthroplasty (TKA) could be the basis of a more aggressive therapeutic approach to prevent KOA progression.","Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Preclinical trial of noncontact anthropometric measurement using IR-UWB radar,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-12209-1,17 May 2022,"Anthropometric profiles are important indices for assessing medical conditions, including malnutrition, obesity, and growth disorders. Noncontact methods for estimating those parameters could have considerable value in many practical situations, such as the assessment of young, uncooperative infants or children and the prevention of infectious disease transmission. The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility of obtaining noncontact anthropometric measurements using the impulse-radio ultrawideband (IR-UWB) radar sensor technique. A total of 45 healthy adults were enrolled, and a convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm was implemented to analyze data extracted from IR-UWB radar. The differences (root-mean-square error, RMSE) between values from the radar and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) as a reference in the measurement of height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) were 2.78, 5.31, and 2.25, respectively; predicted data from the radar highly agreed with those from the BIA. The intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were 0.93, 0.94, and 0.83. In conclusion, IR-UWB radar can provide accurate estimates of anthropometric parameters in a noncontact manner; this study is the first to support the radar sensor as an applicable method in clinical situations.","For the first time, we demonstrated that an innovative, noncontact, novel, effective method, IR-UWB radar technology integrated with a machine learning algorithm, can measure anthropometric profiles successfully with substantial agreement with BIA in adults. Further studies with younger age groups and better algorithms are warranted before the proposed system can be widely used in clinical practice with the robustness of radar.","Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
"CT-based radiomics signature for differentiation between cardiac tumors and thrombi: a retrospective, multicenter study",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-12229-x,17 May 2022,"The study aimed to develop and validate whether the computed tomography (CT) radiomics analysis is effective in differentiating cardiac tumors and thrombi. For this retrospective study, a radiomics model was developed on the basis of a training dataset of 192 patients (61.9 ± 13.3 years, 90 men) with cardiac masses detected in cardiac CT from January 2010 to September 2019. We constructed three models for discriminating between a cardiac tumor and a thrombus: a radiomics model, a clinical model, which included clinical and conventional CT variables, and a model that combined clinical and radiomics models. In the training dataset, the radiomics model and the combined model yielded significantly higher differentiation performance between cardiac tumors and cardiac thrombi than the clinical model (AUC 0.973 vs 0.870, p < 0.001 and AUC 0.983 vs 0.870, p < 0.001, respectively). In the external validation dataset with 63 patients (59.8 ± 13.2 years, 26 men), the combined model yielded a larger AUC compared to the clinical model (AUC 0.911 vs 0.802, p = 0.037). CT radiomics analysis is effective in differentiating cardiac tumors and thrombi. In conclusion, the combination of clinical, conventional CT, and radiomics features demonstrated an additional benefit in differentiating between cardiac tumor and thrombi compared to clinical data and conventional CT features alone.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Detecting sleep outside the clinic using wearable heart rate devices,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-11792-7,13 May 2022,"The adoption of multisensor wearables presents the opportunity of longitudinal monitoring of sleep in large populations. Personalized yet device-agnostic algorithms can sidestep laborious human annotations and objectify cross-cohort comparisons. We developed and tested a heart rate-based algorithm that captures inter- and intra-individual sleep differences in free-living conditions and does not require human input. We evaluated it on four study cohorts using different research- and consumer-grade devices for over 2000 nights. Recording periods included both 24 h free-living and conventional lab-based night-only data. We compared our optimized method against polysomnography, sleep diaries and sleep periods produced through a state-of-the-art acceleration based method. Against sleep diaries, the algorithm yielded a mean squared error of 0.04–0.06 and a total sleep time (TST) deviation of \(-\)2.70 (± 5.74) and 12.80 (± 3.89) minutes, respectively. When evaluated with PSG lab studies, the MSE ranged between 0.06 and 0.11 yielding a time deviation between \(-\)29.07 and \(-\)55.04 minutes. These results showcase the value of this open-source, device-agnostic algorithm for the reliable inference of sleep in free-living conditions and in the absence of annotations.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Improving the design stage of air pollution studies based on wind patterns,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-11939-6,13 May 2022,"A growing literature in economics and epidemiology has exploited changes in wind patterns as a source of exogenous variation to better measure the acute health effects of air pollution. Since the distribution of wind components is not randomly distributed over time and related to other weather parameters, multivariate regression models are used to adjust for these confounding factors. However, this type of analysis relies on its ability to correctly adjust for all confounding factors and extrapolate to units without empirical counterfactuals. As an alternative to current practices and to gauge the extent of these issues, we propose to implement a causal inference pipeline to embed this type of observational study within an hypothetical randomized experiment. We illustrate this approach using daily data from Paris, France, over the 2008–2018 period. Using the Neyman–Rubin potential outcomes framework, we first define the treatment of interest as the effect of North-East winds on particulate matter concentrations compared to the effects of other wind directions. We then implement a matching algorithm to approximate a pairwise randomized experiment. It adjusts nonparametrically for observed confounders while avoiding model extrapolation by discarding treated days without similar control days. We find that the effective sample size for which treated and control units are comparable is surprisingly small. It is however reassuring that results on the matched sample are consistent with a standard regression analysis of the initial data. We finally carry out a quantitative bias analysis to check whether our results could be altered by an unmeasured confounder: estimated effects seem robust to a relatively large hidden bias. Our causal inference pipeline is a principled approach to improve the design of air pollution studies based on wind patterns.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: ; Attacker Capability: 
Non-volatile organic compounds in exhaled breath particles correspond to active tuberculosis,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-12018-6,13 May 2022,"Human breath contains trace amounts of non-volatile organic compounds (NOCs) which might provide non-invasive methods for evaluating individual health. In previous work, we demonstrated that lipids detected in exhaled breath aerosol (EBA) could be used as markers of active tuberculosis (TB). Here, we advanced our analytical platform for characterizing small metabolites and lipids in EBA samples collected from participants enrolled in clinical trials designed to identify molecular signatures of active TB. EBA samples from 26 participants with active TB and 73 healthy participants were processed using a dual-phase extraction method, and metabolites and lipids were identified via mass spectrometry database matching. In total, 13 metabolite and 9 lipid markers were identified with statistically different optimized relative standard deviation values between individuals diagnosed with active TB and the healthy controls. Importantly, EBA lipid profiles can be used to separate the two sample types, indicating the diagnostic potential of the identified molecules. A feature ranking algorithm reduced this number to 10 molecules, with the membrane glycerophospholipid, phosphatidylinositol 24:4, emerging as the top driver of segregation between the two groups. These results support the use of this approach to identify consistent NOC signatures from EBA samples in active TB cases. This suggests the potential to apply this method to other human diseases which alter respiratory NOC release.","In this study, we demonstrated that rich NOCs can be extracted from human exhaled breath using an advanced analytical approach and the analysis could provide an attractive solution for human disease diagnosis. We advanced NOC analysis in human breath in several aspects. Using a comprehensive molecule extraction method, we have shown that hundreds of metabolites and lipids can be collected from human breath. Most importantly, the extraction method is rapid and has the potential to be used for high-volume sample processing in a clinical setting. By integrating MS-based non-targeted omics and sophisticated data analysis, we demonstrated that identified molecule signatures can differentiate active TB cases from healthy individuals based on the assigned importance of each molecule.","Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Short-term causal effects of common treatments in ambulatory children and young adults with cerebral palsy: three machine learning estimates,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-11875-5,12 May 2022,"Orthopedic and neurological impairments (e.g., muscle contractures, spasticity) are often treated in children and young adults with cerebral palsy (CP). Due to challenges arising from combinatorics, research funding priorities, and medical practicalities, and despite extensive study, the evidence base is weak. Our goal was to estimate the short-term effectiveness of 13 common orthopedic and neurological treatments at four different levels of outcome in children and young adults diagnosed with CP. The outcome levels considered were body structures, specific gait kinematic deviations, overall gait kinematic deviations, and functional mobility. We used three well-establish causal inference approaches (direct matching, virtual twins, and Bayesian causal forests) and a large clinical gait analysis database to estimate the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT). We then examined the effectiveness across treatments, methods, and outcome levels. The dataset consisted of 2851 limbs from 933 individuals (some individuals underwent multiple treatment episodes). Current treatments have medium effects on body structures, but modest to minimal effects on gait and functional mobility. The median ATT of 13 common treatments in children and young adults with CP, measured as Cohen’s D, bordered on medium at the body structures level (median [IQR] = 0.42 [0.05, 0.60]) and became smaller as we moved along the causal chain through specific kinematic deviations (0.21 [0.01, 0.33]), overall kinematic deviations (0.09 [0.03, 0.19]), and functional mobility (-0.01 [-0.06, 0.13]). Further work is needed to understand the source of heterogeneous treatment effects, which are large in this patient population. Replication or refutation of these findings by other centers will be valuable to establish the generalizability of these results and for benchmarking of best practices.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
A temporal dependency feature in lower dimension for lung sound signal classification,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-11726-3,12 May 2022,"Respiratory sounds are expressed as nonlinear and nonstationary signals, whose unpredictability makes it difficult to extract significant features for classification. Static cepstral coefficients such as Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), have been used for classification of lung sound signals. However, they are modeled in high-dimensional hyperspectral space, and also lose temporal dependency information. Therefore, we propose shifted \(\delta \)-cepstral coefficients in lower-subspace (SDC-L) as a novel feature for lung sound classification. It preserves temporal dependency information of multiple frames nearby same to original SDC, and improves feature extraction by reducing the hyperspectral dimension. We modified EMD algorithm by adding a stopping rule to objectively select a finite number of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). The performances of SDC-L were evaluated with three machine learning techniques (support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) and random forest (RF)) and two deep learning algorithms (multilayer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural network (cNN)) and one hybrid deep learning algorithm combining cNN with long short term memory (LSTM) in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score. We found that the first 2 IMFs were enough to construct our feature. SVM, MLP and a hybrid deep learning algorithm (cNN plus LSTM) outperformed with SDC-L, and the other classifiers achieved equivalent results with all features. Our findings show that SDC-L is a promising feature for the classification of lung sound signals.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Lessons from a breast cell annotation competition series for school pupils,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-11782-9,12 May 2022,"Due to COVID-19 outbreaks, most school pupils have had to be home-schooled for long periods of time. Two editions of a web-based competition “Beat the Pathologists” for school age participants in the UK ran to fill up pupils’ spare time after home-schooling and evaluate their ability on contributing to AI annotation. The two editions asked the participants to annotate different types of cells on Ki67 stained breast cancer images. The Main competition was at four levels with different level of complexity. We obtained annotations of four kinds of cells entered by school pupils and ground truth from expert pathologists. In this paper, we analyse school pupils’ performance on differentiating different kinds of cells and compare their performance with two neural networks (AlexNet and VGG16). It was observed that children tend to get very good performance in tumour cell annotation with the best F1 measure 0.81 which is a metrics taking both false positives and false negatives into account. Low accuracy was achieved with F1 score 0.75 on positive non-tumour cells and 0.59 on negative non-tumour cells. Superior performance on non-tumour cell detection was achieved by neural networks. VGG16 with training from scratch achieved an F1 score over 0.70 in all cell categories and 0.92 in tumour cell detection. We conclude that non-experts like school pupils have the potential to contribute to large-scale labelling for AI algorithm development if sufficient training activities are organised. We hope that competitions like this can promote public interest in pathology and encourage participation by more non-experts for annotation.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
MEA-Net: multilayer edge attention network for medical image segmentation,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-11852-y,12 May 2022,"Medical image segmentation is a fundamental step in medical analysis and diagnosis. In recent years, deep learning networks have been used for precise segmentation. Numerous improved encoder–decoder structures have been proposed for various segmentation tasks. However, high-level features have gained more research attention than the abundant low-level features in the early stages of segmentation. Consequently, the learning of edge feature maps has been limited, which can lead to ambiguous boundaries of the predicted results. Inspired by the encoder–decoder network and attention mechanism, this study investigates a novel multilayer edge attention network (MEA-Net) to fully utilize the edge information in the encoding stages. MEA-Net comprises three major components: a feature encoder module, a feature decoder module, and an edge module. An edge feature extraction module in the edge module is designed to produce edge feature maps by a sequence of convolution operations so as to integrate the inconsistent edge information from different encoding stages. A multilayer attention guidance module is designed to use each attention feature map to filter edge information and select important and useful features. Through experiments, MEA-Net is evaluated on four medical image datasets, including tongue images, retinal vessel images, lung images, and clinical images. The evaluation values of the Accuracy of four medical image datasets are 0.9957, 0.9736, 0.9942, and 0.9993, respectively. The values of the Dice coefficient are 0.9902, 0.8377, 0.9885, and 0.9704, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that the network being studied outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in terms of the five commonly used evaluation metrics. The proposed MEA-Net can be used for the early diagnosis of relevant diseases. In addition, clinicians can obtain more accurate clinical information from segmented medical images.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: ; Attacker Capability: 
Novel mobility index tracks COVID-19 transmission following stay-at-home orders,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-10941-2,10 May 2022,"Considering the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants and low vaccine access and uptake, minimizing human interactions remains an effective strategy to mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Using a functional principal component analysis, we created a multidimensional mobility index (MI) using six metrics compiled by SafeGraph from all counties in Illinois, Ohio, Michigan and Indiana between January 1 to December 8, 2020. Changes in mobility were defined as a time-updated 7-day rolling average. Associations between our MI and COVID-19 cases were estimated using a quasi-Poisson hierarchical generalized additive model adjusted for population density and the COVID-19 Community Vulnerability Index. Individual mobility metrics varied significantly by counties and by calendar time. More than 50% of the variability in the data was explained by the first principal component by each state, indicating good dimension reduction. While an individual metric of mobility was not associated with surges of COVID-19, our MI was independently associated with COVID-19 cases in all four states given varying time-lags. Following the expiration of stay-at-home orders, a single metric of mobility was not sensitive enough to capture the complexity of human interactions. Monitoring mobility can be an important public health tool, however, it should be modelled as a multidimensional construct.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

It is a major cause of disability, dependency, and poor quality of life. However, in Ethiopia, the magnitude of this cognitive impairment among the elderly community was not investigated. Hence, this study sought to determine the prevalence of cognitive impairment and associated factors among mature and older adults living in the community of Gondar town, Ethiopia, in 2020. A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted at Gondar town, from February 20 to April 30, 2020. Using a single-stage cluster sampling technique, 403 study participants were recruited. Data was collected by a pretested interviewer-administered structured questionnaire which consisting of sociodemographic variables, the Oslo Social Support Scale, and a Standardized Mini-mental State Examination (SMMSE) tool. Epi data version 3.0 was used to enter coded data and then exported into STATA 14 for analysis. Variables with a p-value < 0.25 in the bi-variable logistic regression were included in the multivariable regression. From multivariable logistic regression, variables having a p-value ≤ 0.05 were declared as statistically significant variables. In this study, a total of 403 study participants were involved, and 393 (97.5%) of them completed the survey. Among older participants screened for cognitive impairment, 43.8% was positive for cognitive impairment with a 95% CI (38.8–48.7%). The majority of the participants were (57.5%) male and (44.8%) aged over 60 years. After adjustment, the variables associated with cognitive impairment were age ≥ 75 years [odds ratio (OR) = 7.03, 95% CI 2.78–17.77] and between 61 and 74 years [OR = 3.18, 95% CI 1.81–5.59], and unable to read and write [OR = 5.05, 95% CI 2.04–12.50], low income level [OR = 2.60, 95% CI 1.26–5.20], being female [OR = 2.52, 95% CI 1.50–4.26], poor social support [OR = 2.50, 95% CI 1.30–4.81], and rural residence [OR = 2.39, 95% CI 1.26–4.51]. The prevalence of older participants who screened positively for cognitive impairment was high at Gondar town. The independent predictors of cognitive impairment among older individuals were older age, being unable to read and write, being female, low income, poor social support, and rural dwelling. Therefore, routine screening and social support, as well as free healthcare services for the mature and older community, are needed. Moreover, we strongly recommend the next researcher to use a diagnosis tool to estimate the actual prevalence of the problems among older people.","The prevalence of older participants who screened positively for cognitive impairment was high at Gondar town.

Evaluation of an artificial intelligence-based medical device for diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-022-00598-6,05 May 2022,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) can be reliably diagnosed at 18 months, yet significant diagnostic delays persist in the United States. This double-blinded, multi-site, prospective, active comparator cohort study tested the accuracy of an artificial intelligence-based Software as a Medical Device designed to aid primary care healthcare providers (HCPs) in diagnosing ASD. The Device combines behavioral features from three distinct inputs (a caregiver questionnaire, analysis of two short home videos, and an HCP questionnaire) in a gradient boosted decision tree machine learning algorithm to produce either an ASD positive, ASD negative, or indeterminate output. This study compared Device outputs to diagnostic agreement by two or more independent specialists in a cohort of 18–72-month-olds with developmental delay concerns (425 study completers, 36% female, 29% ASD prevalence). Device output PPV for all study completers was 80.8% (95% confidence intervals (CI), 70.3%–88.8%) and NPV was 98.3% (90.6%–100%). For the 31.8% of participants who received a determinate output (ASD positive or negative) Device sensitivity was 98.4% (91.6%–100%) and specificity was 78.9% (67.6%–87.7%). The Device’s indeterminate output acts as a risk control measure when inputs are insufficiently granular to make a determinate recommendation with confidence. If this risk control measure were removed, the sensitivity for all study completers would fall to 51.6% (63/122) (95% CI 42.4%, 60.8%), and specificity would fall to 18.5% (56/303) (95% CI 14.3%, 23.3%). Among participants for whom the Device abstained from providing a result, specialists identified that 91% had one or more complex neurodevelopmental disorders. No significant differences in Device performance were found across participants’ sex, race/ethnicity, income, or education level. For nearly a third of this primary care sample, the Device enabled timely diagnostic evaluation with a high degree of accuracy. The Device shows promise to significantly increase the number of children able to be diagnosed with ASD in a primary care setting, potentially facilitating earlier intervention and more efficient use of specialist resources.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Quantitative and qualitative analysis of pulmonary arterial hypertension fibrosis using wide-field second harmonic generation microscopy,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-11473-5,05 May 2022,"We demonstrated that wide-field second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy of lung tissue in combination with quantitative analysis of SHG images is a powerful tool for fast and label-free visualization of the fibrosis pathogenesis in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Statistical analysis of the SHG images revealed changes of the collagen content and morphology in the lung tissue during the monocrotaline-induced PAH progression in rats. First order statistics disclosed the dependence of the collagen overproduction on time, the second order statistics indicated tightening of collagen fiber network around blood vessels and their spreading into the alveolar region. Fourier analysis revealed that enhancement of the fiber orientation in the collagen network with PAH progression was followed with its subsequent reduction at the terminating phase of the disease. Proposed approach has potential for assessing pulmonary fibrosis in interstitial lung disease, after lung(s) transplantation, cancer, etc.",Conclusions not available,Gen AI,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: ; Attacker Capability:

Despite all efforts, the success rate of these methods is still low. Also, each of these methods has side effects and costs. Therefore, accurate prediction of treatment success rate is a clinical challenge. This retrospective study aimed to internally validate and compare various machine learning models for predicting the clinical pregnancy rate (CPR) of infertility treatment. For this purpose, data from 1931 patients consisting of in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intra cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) (733) and intra uterine insemination (IUI) (1196) treatments were included. Also, no egg or sperm donation data were used. The performance of machine learning algorithms to predict clinical pregnancy were expressed in terms of accuracy, recall, F-score, positive predictive value (PPV), brier score (BS), Matthew correlation coefficient (MCC), and receiver operating characteristic. The significance of the features with CPR and AUCs was evaluated by Student's t test and DeLong’s algorithm. Random forest (RF) model had the highest accuracy in the IVF/ICSI treatment. The sensitivity, F1 score, PPV, and MCC of the RF model were 0.76, 0.73, 0.80, and 0.5, respectively. These values for IUI treatment were 0.84, 0.80, 0.82, and 0.34, respectively. The BS was 0.13 and 0.15 for IVF/ICS and IUI, respectively. In addition, the estimated AUCs of the RF model for IVF/ICS and IUI were 0.73 and 0.7, respectively. Some essential features were obtained based on RF ranking for the two datasets, including age, follicle stimulation hormone, endometrial thickness, and infertility duration. The results showed a strong relationship between clinical pregnancy and a woman's age. Also, endometrial thickness and the number of follicles decreased with increasing female age in both treatments.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Interpretability and fairness evaluation of deep learning models on MIMIC-IV dataset,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-11012-2,03 May 2022,"The recent release of large-scale healthcare datasets has greatly propelled the research of data-driven deep learning models for healthcare applications. However, due to the nature of such deep black-boxed models, concerns about interpretability, fairness, and biases in healthcare scenarios where human lives are at stake call for a careful and thorough examination of both datasets and models. In this work, we focus on MIMIC-IV (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care, version IV), the largest publicly available healthcare dataset, and conduct comprehensive analyses of interpretability as well as dataset representation bias and prediction fairness of deep learning models for in-hospital mortality prediction. First, we analyze the interpretability of deep learning mortality prediction models and observe that (1) the best-performing interpretability method successfully identifies critical features for mortality prediction on various prediction models as well as recognizing new important features that domain knowledge does not consider; (2) prediction models rely on demographic features, raising concerns in fairness. Therefore, we then evaluate the fairness of models and do observe the unfairness: (1) there exists disparate treatment in prescribing mechanical ventilation among patient groups across ethnicity, gender and age; (2) models often rely on racial attributes unequally across subgroups to generate their predictions. We further draw concrete connections between interpretability methods and fairness metrics by showing how feature importance from interpretability methods can be beneficial in quantifying potential disparities in mortality predictors. Our analysis demonstrates that the prediction performance is not the only factor to consider when evaluating models for healthcare applications, since high prediction performance might be the result of unfair utilization of demographic features. Our findings suggest that future research in AI models for healthcare applications can benefit from utilizing the analysis workflow of interpretability and fairness as well as verifying if models achieve superior performance at the cost of introducing bias.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
RUNX1 mutations contribute to the progression of MDS due to disruption of antitumor cellular defense: a study on patients with lower-risk MDS,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41375-022-01584-3,03 May 2022,"Patients with lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (LR-MDS) have a generally favorable prognosis; however, a small proportion of cases progress rapidly. This study aimed to define molecular biomarkers predictive of LR-MDS progression and to uncover cellular pathways contributing to malignant transformation. The mutational landscape was analyzed in 214 LR-MDS patients, and at least one mutation was detected in 137 patients (64%). Mutated RUNX1 was identified as the main molecular predictor of rapid progression by statistics and machine learning. To study the effect of mutated RUNX1 on pathway regulation, the expression profiles of CD34 + cells from LR-MDS patients with RUNX1 mutations were compared to those from patients without RUNX1 mutations. The data suggest that RUNX1-unmutated LR-MDS cells are protected by DNA damage response (DDR) mechanisms and cellular senescence as an antitumor cellular barrier, while RUNX1 mutations may be one of the triggers of malignant transformation. Dysregulated DDR and cellular senescence were also observed at the functional level by detecting γH2AX expression and β-galactosidase activity. Notably, the expression profiles of RUNX1-mutated LR-MDS resembled those of higher-risk MDS at diagnosis. This study demonstrates that incorporating molecular data improves LR-MDS risk stratification and that mutated RUNX1 is associated with a suppressed defense against LR-MDS progression.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Comparison of blood pool and myocardial 3D printing in the diagnosis of types of congenital heart disease,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-11294-6,03 May 2022,"The study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of blood pool and myocardial models made by stereolithography in the diagnosis of different types of congenital heart disease (CHD). Two modeling methods were applied in the diagnosis of 8 cases, and two control groups consisting of experts and students diagnosed the cases using echocardiography with computed tomography, blood pool models, and myocardial models. The importance, suitability, and simulation degree of different models were analyzed. The average diagnostic rate before and after 3D printing was used was 88.75% and 95.9% (P = 0.001) in the expert group and 60% and 91.6% (P = 0.000) in the student group, respectively. 3D printing was considered to be more important for the diagnosis of complex CHDs (very important; average, 87.8%) than simple CHDs (very important; average, 30.8%) (P = 0.000). Myocardial models were considered most realistic regarding the structure of the heart (average, 92.5%). In cases of congenital corrected transposition of great arteries, Williams syndrome, coronary artery fistula, tetralogy of Fallot, patent ductus arteriosus, and coarctation of the aorta, blood pool models were considered more effective (average, 92.1%), while in cases of double outlet right ventricle and ventricular septal defect, myocardial models were considered optimal (average, 80%).",Conclusions not available,Gen AI,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Plasma proteome analyses in individuals of European and African ancestry identify cis-pQTLs and models for proteome-wide association studies,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-022-01051-w,02 May 2022,"Improved understanding of genetic regulation of the proteome can facilitate identification of the causal mechanisms for complex traits. We analyzed data on 4,657 plasma proteins from 7,213 European American (EA) and 1,871 African American (AA) individuals from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study, and further replicated findings on 467 AA individuals from the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension study. Here, we identified 2,004 proteins in EA and 1,618 in AA, with most overlapping, which showed associations with common variants in cis-regions. Availability of AA samples led to smaller credible sets and notable number of population-specific cis-protein quantitative trait loci. Elastic Net produced powerful models for protein prediction in both populations. An application of proteome-wide association studies to serum urate and gout implicated several proteins, including IL1RN, revealing the promise of the drug anakinra to treat acute gout flares.

Risk factors for severe COVID-19 differ by age for hospitalized adults,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-10344-3,28 Apr 2022,"Risk stratification for hospitalized adults with COVID-19 is essential to inform decisions about individual patients and allocation of resources. So far, risk models for severe COVID outcomes have included age but have not been optimized to best serve the needs of either older or younger adults. Models also need to be updated to reflect improvements in COVID-19 treatments. This retrospective study analyzed data from 6906 hospitalized adults with COVID-19 from a community health system across five states in the western United States. Risk models were developed to predict mechanical ventilation illness or death across one to 56 days of hospitalization, using clinical data available within the first hour after either admission with COVID-19 or a first positive SARS-CoV-2 test. For the seven-day interval, models for age ≥ 18 and < 50 years reached AUROC 0.81 (95% CI 0.71–0.91) and models for age ≥ 50 years reached AUROC 0.82 (95% CI 0.77–0.86). Models revealed differences in the statistical significance and relative predictive value of risk factors between older and younger patients including age, BMI, vital signs, and laboratory results. In addition, for hospitalized patients, sex and chronic comorbidities had lower predictive value than vital signs and laboratory results.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Continuous monitoring of surgical bimanual expertise using deep neural networks in virtual reality simulation,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-022-00596-8,26 Apr 2022,"In procedural-based medicine, the technical ability can be a critical determinant of patient outcomes. Psychomotor performance occurs in real-time, hence a continuous assessment is necessary to provide action-oriented feedback and error avoidance guidance. We outline a deep learning application, the Intelligent Continuous Expertise Monitoring System (ICEMS), to assess surgical bimanual performance at 0.2-s intervals. A long-short term memory network was built using neurosurgeon and student performance in 156 virtually simulated tumor resection tasks. Algorithm predictive ability was tested separately on 144 procedures by scoring the performance of neurosurgical trainees who are at different training stages. The ICEMS successfully differentiated between neurosurgeons, senior trainees, junior trainees, and students. Trainee average performance score correlated with the year of training in neurosurgery. Furthermore, coaching and risk assessment for critical metrics were demonstrated. This work presents a comprehensive technical skill monitoring system with predictive validation throughout surgical residency training, with the ability to detect errors.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Lipid level alteration in human and cellular models of alpha synuclein mutations,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41531-022-00313-y,25 Apr 2022,"Lipid profiles in biological fluids from patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) are increasingly investigated in search of biomarkers. However, the lipid profiles in genetic PD remain to be determined, a gap of knowledge of particular interest in PD associated with mutant α-synuclein (SNCA), given the known relationship between this protein and lipids. The objective of this research is to identify serum lipid composition from SNCA A53T mutation carriers and to compare these alterations to those found in cells and transgenic mice carrying the same genetic mutation. We conducted an unbiased lipidomic analysis of 530 lipid species from 34 lipid classes in serum of 30 participants with SNCA mutation with and without PD and 30 healthy controls. The primary analysis was done between 22 PD patients with SNCA+ (SNCA+/PD+) and 30 controls using machine-learning algorithms and traditional statistics. We also analyzed the lipid composition of human clonal-cell lines and tissue from transgenic mice overexpressing the same SNCA mutation. We identified specific lipid classes that best discriminate between SNCA+/PD+ patients and healthy controls and found certain lipid species, mainly from the glycerophosphatidylcholine and triradylglycerol classes, that are most contributory to this discrimination. Most of these alterations were also present in human derived cells and transgenic mice carrying the same mutation. Our combination of lipidomic and machine learning analyses revealed alterations in glycerophosphatidylcholine and triradylglycerol in sera from PD patients as well as cells and tissues expressing mutant α-Syn. Further investigations are needed to establish the pathogenic significance of these α-Syn-associated lipid changes.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Advances in wireless technologies enable remote delivery of light to tumors, but suffer from key limitations, including low levels of tissue penetration and photosensitizer activation. Here, we introduce DeepLabCut (DLC)-informed low-power wireless telemetry with an integrated thermal/light simulation platform that overcomes the above constraints. The simulator produces an optimized combination of wavelengths and light sources, and DLC-assisted wireless telemetry uses the parameters from the simulator to enable adequate illumination of tumors through high-throughput (<20 mice) and multi-wavelength operation. Together, they establish a range of guidelines for effective PDT regimen design. In vivo Hypericin and Foscan mediated PDT, using cancer xenograft models, demonstrates substantial suppression of tumor growth, warranting further investigation in research and/or clinical settings.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: ; Attacker Capability: 
Machine learning approaches to predicting no-shows in pediatric medical appointment,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-022-00594-w,20 Apr 2022,"Patients’ no-shows, scheduled but unattended medical appointments, have a direct negative impact on patients’ health, due to discontinuity of treatment and late presentation to care. They also lead to inefficient use of medical resources in hospitals and clinics. The ability to predict a likely no-show in advance could enable the design and implementation of interventions to reduce the risk of it happening, thus improving patients’ care and clinical resource allocation. In this study, we develop a new interpretable deep learning-based approach for predicting the risk of no-shows at the time when a medical appointment is first scheduled. The retrospective study was conducted in an academic pediatric teaching hospital with a 20% no-show rate. Our approach tackles several challenges in the design of a predictive model by (1) adopting a data imputation method for patients with missing information in their records (77% of the population), (2) exploiting local weather information to improve predictive accuracy, and (3) developing an interpretable approach that explains how a prediction is made for each individual patient. Our proposed neural network-based and logistic regression-based methods outperformed persistence baselines. In an unobserved set of patients, our method correctly identified 83% of no-shows at the time of scheduling and led to a false alert rate less than 17%. Our method is capable of producing meaningful predictions even when some information in a patient’s records is missing. We find that patients’ past no-show record is the strongest predictor. Finally, we discuss several potential interventions to reduce no-shows, such as scheduling appointments of high-risk patients at off-peak times, which can serve as starting point for further studies on no-show interventions.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: backdoor; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Severe acute kidney disease is associated with worse kidney outcome among acute kidney injury patients,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-09599-7,20 Apr 2022,"Acute kidney disease (AKD) comprises acute kidney injury (AKI). However, whether the AKD staging system has prognostic values among AKI patients with different baseline estimated glomerular filtration (eGFR) remains a controversial issue. Algorithm-based approach was applied to identify AKI occurrence and to define different AKD stages. Risk ratio for major adverse kidney events (MAKE), including (1) eGFR decline > 35% from baseline, (2) initiation of dialysis, (3) in-hospital mortality of different AKD subgroups were identified by multivariable logistic regression. Among the 4741 AKI patients identified from January 2015 to December 2018, AKD stages 1–3 after AKI was common (53% in the lower baseline eGFR group and 51% in the higher baseline eGFR group). In the logistic regression model adjusted for demographics and comorbidities at 1-year follow-up, AKD stages 1/2/3 (AKD stage 0 as reference group) were associated with higher risks of MAKE (AKD stage: odds ratio, 95% confidence interval [95% CI], AKD 1: 1.85, 1.56–2.19; AKD 2: 3.43, 2.85–4.12; AKD 3: 10.41, 8.68–12.49). Regardless of baseline eGFR, staging criteria for AKD identified AKI patients who were at higher risk of kidney function decline, dialysis and mortality.

The impact of maternal asthma on the preterm infants' gut metabolome and microbiome (MAP study),https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-10276-y,19 Apr 2022,"Preterm infants are at a greater risk for the development of asthma and atopic disease, which can lead to lifelong negative health consequences. This may be due, in part, to alterations that occur in the gut microbiome and metabolome during their stay in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). To explore the differential roles of family history (i.e., predisposition due to maternal asthma diagnosis) and hospital-related environmental and clinical factors that alter microbial exposures early in life, we considered a unique cohort of preterm infants born ≤ 34 weeks gestational age from two local level III NICUs, as part of the MAP (Microbiome, Atopic disease, and Prematurity) Study. From MAP participants, we chose a sub-cohort of infants whose mothers had a history of asthma and matched gestational age and sex to infants of mothers without a history of asthma diagnosis (control). We performed a prospective, paired metagenomic and metabolomic analysis of stool and milk feed samples collected at birth, 2 weeks, and 6 weeks postnatal age. Although there were clinical factors associated with shifts in the diversity and composition of stool-associated bacterial communities, maternal asthma diagnosis did not play an observable role in shaping the infant gut microbiome during the study period. There were significant differences, however, in the metabolite profile between the maternal asthma and control groups at 6 weeks postnatal age. The most notable changes occurred in the linoleic acid spectral network, which plays a role in inflammatory and immune pathways, suggesting early metabolomic changes in the gut of preterm infants born to mothers with a history of asthma. Our pilot study suggests that a history of maternal asthma alters a preterm infants’ metabolomic pathways in the gut, as early as the first 6 weeks of life.",Conclusions not available,Gen AI,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Using deep learning to predict abdominal age from liver and pancreas magnetic resonance images,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-29525-9,13 Apr 2022,"With age, the prevalence of diseases such as fatty liver disease, cirrhosis, and type two diabetes increases. Approaches to both predict abdominal age and identify risk factors for accelerated abdominal age may ultimately lead to advances that will delay the onset of these diseases. We build an abdominal age predictor by training convolutional neural networks to predict abdominal age (or “AbdAge”) from 45,552 liver magnetic resonance images [MRIs] and 36,784 pancreas MRIs (R-Squared = 73.3 ± 0.6; mean absolute error = 2.94 ± 0.03 years). Attention maps show that the prediction is driven by both liver and pancreas anatomical features, and surrounding organs and tissue. Abdominal aging is a complex trait, partially heritable (h_g2 = 26.3 ± 1.9%), and associated with 16 genetic loci (e.g. in PLEKHA1 and EFEMP1), biomarkers (e.g body impedance), clinical phenotypes (e.g, chest pain), diseases (e.g. hypertension), environmental (e.g smoking), and socioeconomic (e.g education, income) factors.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: ; Attacker Capability: 
Paper-based genetic assays with bioconjugated gold nanorods and an automated readout pipeline,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-10227-7,13 Apr 2022,"Paper-based biosensors featuring immunoconjugated gold nanoparticles have gained extraordinary momentum in recent times as the platform of choice in key cases of field applications, including the so-called rapid antigen tests for SARS-CoV-2. Here, we propose a revision of this format, one that may leverage on the most recent advances in materials science and data processing. In particular, we target an amplifiable DNA rather than a protein analyte, and we replace gold nanospheres with anisotropic nanorods, which are intrinsically brighter by a factor of ~ 10, and multiplexable. By comparison with a gold-standard method for dot-blot readout with digoxigenin, we show that gold nanorods entail much faster and easier processing, at the cost of a higher limit of detection (from below 1 to 10 ppm in the case of plasmid DNA containing a target transgene, in our current setup). In addition, we test a complete workflow to acquire and process photographs of dot-blot membranes with custom-made hardware and regression tools, as a strategy to gain more analytical sensitivity and potential for quantification. A leave-one-out approach for training and validation with as few as 36 sample instances already improves the limit of detection reached by the naked eye by a factor around 2. Taken together, we conjecture that the synergistic combination of new materials and innovative tools for data processing may bring the analytical sensitivity of paper-based biosensors to approach the level of lab-grade molecular tests.","In conclusion, we have conjugated citrate-terminated gold nanorods with two different nucleotide probes and implemented a setup that pursues a rapid, accurate and reproducible method of detection of a genetic target. Although the use of gold nanorods implies a lower sensitivity than the gold-standard method based on digoxigenin, our system may be enough for use in critical contexts like the diagnosis of most infectious diseases, where the pathogen concentration is relatively high. It works fine with a model target, as well as PCR products and plasmid DNA, and it is stringent against single point mutations. The main advantage is a much more streamlined procedure, which may also open new possibilities, like the real-time observation of biorecognition events occurring under dynamic conditions.We have also discussed the perspective to analyze the dot-blot membranes with a supervised machine learning approach implemented after a dedicated methodology for the acquisition of standardized photographs. A simple linear regressor built over a dataset of as few as 36 dots already returned leave-one-out cross-validation predictions with a MAE of 0.59 ppm, which decreases to 0.24 ppm in the range of concentration of the target analyte below 1 ppm. These results are rather surprising, when it is considered that the starting point was a naked-eye detection limit around 0.42 ppm, and that the entire pipeline from system hardware for standardized imaging to the accumulation of an adequate training dataset and the optimization of the regression model leaves substantial room for improvement.In conclusion, our work demonstrates the feasibility of a collective revision of the paper-based format built upon a synergistic combination of complementary enhancements: (1) The use of gold nanorods or other anisotropic shapes, which give intrinsic 10× brightness with respect to standard spherical particles, and are multiplexable. (2) The optimization of a genetic strategy, where we made a 5× improvement of the detection limit of a transgene cloned into a plasmid by just tuning the chain length of a synthetic probe. And (3) the implementation of a pipeline for quantitative readout based on machine learning, where an early test already returned another 2× upgrade of the sensitivity reached by the naked eye. Taken together, we are confident that our work will motivate more efforts to integrate recent advances in nanobiotechnology and data processing into topical tools like the so-called rapid antigen-tests for SARS-CoV-2, in order to boost their analytical performance and draw closer to the level of lab-grade methods.","Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Using the Mass General Brigham multi-institutional EHR, we approximated a community-based cohort by sampling patients receiving longitudinal primary care between 2001-2018 (Community Care Cohort Project [C3PO], n = 520,868). We utilized natural language processing (NLP) to recover vital signs from unstructured notes. We assessed the validity of C3PO by deploying established risk models for myocardial infarction/stroke and atrial fibrillation. We then compared C3PO to Convenience Samples including all individuals from the same EHR with complete data, but without a longitudinal primary care requirement. NLP reduced the missingness of vital signs by 31%. NLP-recovered vital signs were highly correlated with values derived from structured fields (Pearson r range 0.95–0.99). Atrial fibrillation and myocardial infarction/stroke incidence were lower and risk models were better calibrated in C3PO as opposed to the Convenience Samples (calibration error range for myocardial infarction/stroke: 0.012–0.030 in C3PO vs. 0.028–0.046 in Convenience Samples; calibration error for atrial fibrillation 0.028 in C3PO vs. 0.036 in Convenience Samples).

On evaluation metrics for medical applications of artificial intelligence,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-09954-8,08 Apr 2022,"Clinicians and software developers need to understand how proposed machine learning (ML) models could improve patient care. No single metric captures all the desirable properties of a model, which is why several metrics are typically reported to summarize a model’s performance. Unfortunately, these measures are not easily understandable by many clinicians. Moreover, comparison of models across studies in an objective manner is challenging, and no tool exists to compare models using the same performance metrics. This paper looks at previous ML studies done in gastroenterology, provides an explanation of what different metrics mean in the context of binary classification in the presented studies, and gives a thorough explanation of how different metrics should be interpreted.

Prediction of treatment outcome in neovascular age-related macular degeneration using a novel convolutional neural network,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-09642-7,07 Apr 2022,"While prognosis and risk of progression are crucial in developing precise therapeutic strategy in neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), limited predictive tools are available. We proposed a novel deep convolutional neural network that enables feature extraction through image and non-image data integration to seize imperative information and achieve highly accurate outcome prediction. The Heterogeneous Data Fusion Net (HDF-Net) was designed to predict visual acuity (VA) outcome (improvement ≥ 2 line or not) at 12th months after anti-VEGF treatment. A set of pre-treatment optical coherence tomography (OCT) image and non-image demographic features were employed as input data and the corresponding 12th-month post-treatment VA as the target data to train, validate, and test the HDF-Net. This newly designed HDF-Net demonstrated an AUC of 0.989 (95% CI 0.970–0.999), accuracy of 0.936 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.889–0.964], sensitivity of 0.933 (95% CI 0.841–0.974), and specificity of 0.938 (95% CI 0.877–0.969). By simulating the clinical decision process with mixed pre-treatment information from raw OCT images and numeric data, HDF-Net demonstrated promising performance in predicting individualized treatment outcome. The results highlight the potential of deep learning to simultaneously process a broad range of clinical data to weigh and leverage the complete information of the patient.

We formed an international, multidisciplinary working group that developed an accessible questionnaire including key issues about adults with RTS and disseminated this to all known RTS support groups via social media. We report the observations from a cohort of 87 adult individuals of whom 43 had a molecularly confirmed diagnosis. The adult natural history of RTS is defined by prevalent behavioural/psychiatric problems (83%), gastrointestinal problems (73%) that are represented mainly by constipation; and sleep problems (62%) that manifest in a consistent pattern of sleep apnoea, difficulty staying asleep and an increased need for sleep. Furthermore, over than half of the RTS individuals (65%) had skin and adnexa-related problems. Half of the individuals receive multidisciplinary follow-up and required surgery at least once, and most frequently more than once, during adulthood. Our data confirm that adults with RTS enjoy both social and occupational possibilities, show a variegated experience of everyday life but experience a significant morbidity and ongoing medical issues which do not appear to be as coordinated and multidisciplinary managed as in paediatric patients.

Bayesian network meta-analysis of face masks' impact on human physiology,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-09747-z,06 Apr 2022,"Several concerns regarding the safety of face masks use have been propounded in public opinion. The objective of this review is to examine if these concerns find support in the literature by providing a comprehensive overview of physiological responses to the use of face masks. We have performed a systematic review, pairwise and network meta-analyses to investigate physiological responses to the use of face masks. The study has been registered with PROSPERO (C RD42020224791). Obtained results were screened using our exclusion and inclusion criteria. Meta-analyses were performed using the GeMTC and meta R packages. We have identified 26 studies meeting our inclusion and exclusion criteria, encompassing 751 participants. The use of face masks was not associated with significant changes in pulsoxymetrically measured oxygen saturation, even during maximal-effort exercises. The only significant physiological responses to the use of face masks during low-intensity activities were a slight increase in heart rate, mildly elevated partial pressure of carbon dioxide (not meeting criteria for hypercarbia), increased temperature of facial skin covered by the mask, and subsequent increase of the score in the rating of heat perception, with N95 filtering facepiece respirators having a greater effect than surgical masks. In high-intensity conditions, the use of face masks was associated with decreased oxygen uptake, ventilation, and RR. Face masks are safe to use and do not cause significant alterations in human physiology. The increase in heart rate stems most likely from increased respiratory work required to overcome breathing resistance. The increase in carbon dioxide is too small to be clinically relevant. An increased rating of heat perception when using face masks results from higher temperature of facial skin covered by the mask.","The use of surgical face masks and N95 FFRs does not cause a reduction in pulsoxymetrically measured oxygen saturation, even during high-intensity exercise. N95 FFRs cause a slight accumulation of CO2, but this effect is not sufficient to cause hypercarbia. FFRs slightly increase HR, most likely due to increased respiratory work. Wearing N95 FFRs causes significant thermal discomfort, which stems most likely from an increased temperature of skin covered by FFR.","Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
"fastMRI+, Clinical pathology annotations for knee and brain fully sampled magnetic resonance imaging data",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01255-z,05 Apr 2022,"Improving speed and image quality of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) using deep learning reconstruction is an active area of research. The fastMRI dataset contains large volumes of raw MRI data, which has enabled significant advances in this field. While the impact of the fastMRI dataset is unquestioned, the dataset currently lacks clinical expert pathology annotations, critical to addressing clinically relevant reconstruction frameworks and exploring important questions regarding rendering of specific pathology using such novel approaches. This work introduces fastMRI+, which consists of 16154 subspecialist expert bounding box annotations and 13 study-level labels for 22 different pathology categories on the fastMRI knee dataset, and 7570 subspecialist expert bounding box annotations and 643 study-level labels for 30 different pathology categories for the fastMRI brain dataset.

Intestinal bacteria flora changes in patients with Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia with or without wheezing,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-09700-0,05 Apr 2022,"Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) infection is a common cause of community-acquired pneumonia in children. Furthermore, many children with Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (MPP) have recurrent wheezing and reduced small airway function after their clinical symptoms have resolved, eventually leading to asthma. MPP can trigger immune disorders and systemic inflammatory responses. Hence, the intestine is the largest immune organ of the body. Therefore, we sought to investigate whether the alteration of intestinal flora is correlated with the development of wheezing in children with MPP. We collected 30 healthy children as group A, 50 children with nonwheezing MPP as group B, and 50 children with wheezing MPP as group C. We found that the percentage of eosinophil cells (EC) was significantly higher in group C than that in group B for routine blood tests and serum inflammatory factors. The serum cytokines, including IL-4, IL-17, TNF-α, and TGF-β, were significantly higher in group C than in group B. In addition, the level of IL-10 was significantly lower in group C than in group B. The distribution characteristics of intestinal flora strains in children with MPP were detected by sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. There were differences in the abundance of intestinal flora between children with MPP and healthy children, with lower abundance of Ruminococcus flavefaciens, Clostridium butyricum, Lactobacillus, and Bifidobacterium in the intestine of children with MPP compared to healthy children. The abundance of Ruminococcus flavefaciens and Clostridium butyricum was significantly lower in the intestine of children with wheezing MPP compared to children without wheezing MPP. In the correlation analysis between children with MPP and inflammatory factors, Ruminococcus flavefaciens was found to be negatively correlated with IL-17. Clostridium butyricum was negatively correlated with L-4, IL-17, TNF-α, and TGF-β; however, it positively correlated with IL-10. Thus, it was concluded that alterations in intestinal flora play a crucial role in the immune response to MPP, where a significant decline in intestinal Ruminococcus flavefaciens and Clostridium butyricum leads to an exacerbation of the inflammatory responses, which may promote the development of children with wheezing MPP.","We believe that our work has a role to play in the prevention and treatment of MP infections and in the maturation of the microbial “gut-lung axis,” which differs in the abundance and diversity of intestinal microorganisms in children with MPP compared to healthy children. We found a correlation between serum inflammatory factors and Ruminococcus flavefaciens and Clostridium butyricum in children with MPP and a significant decrease in the number of Ruminococcus flavefaciens and Clostridium butyricum in the gut of children with wheezing, which may be aggravates the inflammatory reaction of children with wheezing MPP. We suggest that the diversity of intestinal probiotics and the number of flora determine the microbial ecological balance of the gut in children and are relevant to the evolution and prognosis of children with MPP. We speculate that the “gut-lung axis” interrelation may also be related to gut flora metabolites, in addition to gut flora. In future studies of the gut flora of MPP, we will further develop the mechanisms of immune and metabolic interactions between the microflora in the gut and MP colonization in the lung. Studying the gut microecology in children, regulating the gut flora, and maintaining a balanced gut microecological environment may be a future trend in preventing asthma, and even respiratory disease in general, in children with MPP.",Gen AI,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Developing a shared sepsis data infrastructure: a systematic review and concept map to FHIR,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-022-00580-2,04 Apr 2022,"The development of a shared data infrastructure across health systems could improve research, clinical care, and health policy across a spectrum of diseases, including sepsis. Awareness of the potential value of such infrastructure has been heightened by COVID-19, as the lack of a real-time, interoperable data network impaired disease identification, mitigation, and eradication. The Sepsis on FHIR collaboration establishes a dynamic, federated, and interoperable system of sepsis data from 55 hospitals using 2 distinct inpatient electronic health record systems. Here we report on phase 1, a systematic review to identify clinical variables required to define sepsis and its subtypes to produce a concept mapping of elements onto Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR). Relevant papers described consensus sepsis definitions, provided criteria for sepsis, severe sepsis, septic shock, or detailed sepsis subtypes. Studies not written in English, published prior to 1970, or “grey” literature were prospectively excluded. We analyzed 55 manuscripts yielding 151 unique clinical variables. We then mapped variables to their corresponding US Core FHIR resources and specific code values. This work establishes the framework to develop a flexible infrastructure for sharing sepsis data, highlighting how FHIR could enable the extension of this approach to other important conditions relevant to public health.",Conclusions not available,Gen AI,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Classification of pleural effusions using deep learning visual models: contrastive-loss,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-09550-w,01 Apr 2022,"Blood and fluid analysis is extensively used for classifying the etiology of pleural effusion. However, most studies focused on determining the presence of a disease. This study classified pleural effusion etiology employing deep learning models by applying contrastive-loss. Patients with pleural effusion who underwent thoracentesis between 2009 and 2019 at the Asan Medical Center were analyzed. Five different models for categorizing the etiology of pleural effusion were compared. The performance metrics were top-1 accuracy, top-2 accuracy, and micro-and weighted-AUROC. UMAP and t-SNE were used to visualize the contrastive-loss model’s embedding space. Although the 5 models displayed similar performance in the validation set, the contrastive-loss model showed the highest accuracy in the extra-validation set. Additionally, the accuracy and micro-AUROC of the contrastive-loss model were 81.7% and 0.942 in the validation set, and 66.2% and 0.867 in the extra-validation set. Furthermore, the embedding space visualization in the contrastive-loss model exhibited typical and atypical effusion results by comparing the true and false positives of the rule-based criteria. Therefore, classifying the etiology of pleural effusion was achievable using the contrastive-loss model. Conclusively, visualization of the contrastive-loss model will provide clinicians with valuable insights for etiology diagnosis by differentiating between typical and atypical disease types.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
A dataset of non-pharmaceutical interventions on SARS-CoV-2 in Europe,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01175-y,01 Apr 2022,"During the second half of 2020, many European governments responded to the resurging transmission of SARS-CoV-2 with wide-ranging non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). These efforts were often highly targeted at the regional level and included fine-grained NPIs. This paper describes a new dataset designed for the accurate recording of NPIs in Europe’s second wave to allow precise modelling of NPI effectiveness. The dataset includes interventions from 114 regions in 7 European countries during the period from the 1st August 2020 to the 9th January 2021. The paper includes NPI definitions tailored to the second wave following an exploratory data collection. Each entry has been extensively validated by semi-independent double entry, comparison with existing datasets, and, when necessary, discussion with local epidemiologists. The dataset has considerable potential for use in disentangling the effectiveness of NPIs and comparing the impact of interventions across different phases of the pandemic.",Conclusions not available,Gen AI,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: ; Attacker Capability: 
Implementation of an interactive virtual microscope laboratory system in teaching oral histopathology,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-09473-6,31 Mar 2022,"Laboratory course acts as a key component of histopathology education. Recent trends of incorporating visual and interactive technology in active and inquiry-based learning pedagogical methods have led to significant improvement of histopathology laboratory courses. The present work aimed to describe interactive virtual microscope laboratory system (IVMLS) as a virtual platform for teaching histopathology in order to improve the quality and efficiency of teaching. The system is based on interactive technology and consists of interactive software, slide-reading software, teaching resources and integrated auxiliary equipment. It allows real-time interaction between teachers and students and provides students with a wealth of learning and review materials. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the system, we conducted a comparative study with the use of light microscope (LM) as a method. Specifically, we compared the results of six assignments and one laboratory final exam between IVMLS group and LM group to analyse the impact of IVMLS on students' academic performance. A questionnaire survey was also conducted to obtain students' attitudes and views on this system. There was no overall difference in assignment performance between IVMLS group and LM group. But laboratory final test grades increased from a mean of 62% (43.8–80.0, 95% CI) before to 83% (71.0–94.2, 95% CI) after implement IVMLS, suggesting highly significant (p < 0.001) improvement on students' histopathology laboratory performance. Feedback of the questionnaire was positive, indicating that students were satisfied with the system, which they believed improved student communication and teacher-student interaction, increased learning resources, increased their focus on learning, and facilitated their independent thinking process. This study proves that IVMLS is an efficient and feasible teaching technology and improves students' academic performance.",Conclusions not available,Gen AI,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: ; Attacker Capability: 
Multivariate genomic and transcriptomic determinants of imaging-derived personalized therapeutic needs in Parkinson’s disease,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-09506-0,31 Mar 2022,"Due to the marked interpersonal neuropathologic and clinical heterogeneity of Parkinson's disease (PD), current interventions are not personalized and fail to benefit all patients. Furthermore, we continue to lack well-established methods and clinical tests to tailor interventions at the individual level in PD. Here, we identify the genetic determinants of individual-tailored treatment needs derived from longitudinal multimodal neuroimaging data in 294 PD patients (PPMI data). Advanced multivariate statistical analysis revealed that both genomic and blood transcriptomic data significantly explain (P < 0.01, FWE-corrected) the interindividual variability in therapeutic needs associated with dopaminergic, functional, and structural brain reorganization. We confirmed a high overlap between the identified highly predictive molecular pathways and determinants of levodopa clinical responsiveness, including well-known (Wnt signaling, angiogenesis, dopaminergic activity) and recently discovered (immune markers, gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor) pathways/components. In addition, the observed strong correspondence between the identified genomic and baseline-transcriptomic determinants of treatment needs/response supports the genome's active role at the time of patient evaluation (i.e., beyond individual genetic predispositions at birth). This study paves the way for effectively combining genomic, transcriptomic and neuroimaging data for implementing successful individually tailored interventions in PD and extending our pathogenetic understanding of this multifactorial and heterogeneous disorder.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Impact of recording length and other arrhythmias on atrial fibrillation detection from wrist photoplethysmogram using smartwatches,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-09181-1,30 Mar 2022,"This study aimed to evaluate whether quantitative analysis of wrist photoplethysmography (PPG) could detect atrial fibrillation (AF). Continuous electrocardiograms recorded using an electrophysiology recording system and PPG obtained using a wrist-worn smartwatch were simultaneously collected from patients undergoing catheter ablation or electrical cardioversion. PPG features were extracted from 10, 25, 40, and 80 heartbeats of the split segments. Machine learning with a support vector machine and random forest approach were used to detect AF. A total of 116 patients were evaluated. We annotated > 117 h of PPG. A total of 6475 and 3957 segments of 25-beat pulse-to-pulse intervals (PPIs) were annotated as AF and sinus rhythm, respectively. The accuracy of the 25 PPIs yielded a test area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.9676, which was significantly better than the AUC for the 10 PPIs (0.9453; P < .001). PPGs obtained from another 38 patients with frequent premature ventricular/atrial complexes (PVCs/PACs) were used to evaluate the impact of other arrhythmias on diagnostic accuracy. The new AF detection algorithm achieved an AUC of 0.9680. The appropriate data length of PPG for optimizing the PPG analytics program was 25 heartbeats. Algorithm modification using a machine learning approach shows robustness to PVCs/PACs.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
High-speed light-sheet microscopy for the in-situ acquisition of volumetric histological images of living tissue,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-022-00849-7,28 Mar 2022,"Histological examinations typically require the excision of tissue, followed by its fixation, slicing, staining, mounting and imaging, with timeframes ranging from minutes to days. This process may remove functional tissue, may miss abnormalities through under-sampling, prevents rapid decision-making, and increases costs. Here, we report the feasibility of microscopes based on swept confocally aligned planar excitation technology for the volumetric histological imaging of intact living tissue in real time. The systems’ single-objective, light-sheet geometry and 3D imaging speeds enable roving image acquisition, which combined with 3D stitching permits the contiguous analysis of large tissue areas, as well as the dynamic assessment of tissue perfusion and function. Implemented in benchtop and miniaturized form factors, the microscopes also have high sensitivity, even for weak intrinsic fluorescence, allowing for the label-free imaging of diagnostically relevant histoarchitectural structures, as we show for pancreatic disease in living mice, for chronic kidney disease in fresh human kidney tissues, and for oral mucosa in a healthy volunteer. Miniaturized high-speed light-sheet microscopes for in-situ volumetric histological imaging may facilitate the point-of-care detection of diverse cellular-level biomarkers.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Estimated date of delivery with electronic medical records by a hybrid GBDT-GRU model,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-08664-5,22 Mar 2022,"An accurate estimated date of delivery (EDD) helps pregnant women make adequate preparations before delivery and avoid the panic of parturition. EDD is normally derived from some formulates or estimated by doctors based on last menstruation period and ultrasound examinations. This study attempted to combine antenatal examinations and electronic medical records to develop a hybrid model based on Gradient Boosting Decision Tree and Gated Recurrent Unit (GBDT-GRU). Besides exploring the features that affect the EDD, GBDT-GRU model obtained the results by dynamic prediction of different stages. The mean square error (MSE) and coefficient of determination (R2) were used to compare the performance among the different prediction methods. In addition, we evaluated predictive performances of different prediction models by comparing the proportion of pregnant women under the error of different days. Experimental results showed that the performance indexes of hybrid GBDT-GRU model outperformed other prediction methods because it focuses on analyzing the time-series predictors of pregnancy. The results of this study are helpful for the development of guidelines for clinical delivery treatments, as it can assist clinicians in making correct decisions during obstetric examinations.","In this paper, a hybrid model of a GBDT model and GRU model was proposed to predict EDD. For a more accurate EDD, we established a hybrid model of the parameters related to pregnant women and fetal physical examination. The results show that GBDT-GRU achieves a satisfactory outcome in the experiment and the accuracy of the EDD can be improved by adjusting the number of features. Therefore, our hybrid model is an effective method to support clinical decision making and artificial intelligence methods have great application potential in obstetrical practice. Future studies should also solve the problem of predicting the EDD within the scope of preterm delivery.","Traditional ML, DNN",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: ; Attacker Capability: 
Deep learning-enabled assessment of cardiac allograft rejection from endomyocardial biopsies,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-01709-2,21 Mar 2022,"Endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) screening represents the standard of care for detecting allograft rejections after heart transplant. Manual interpretation of EMBs is affected by substantial interobserver and intraobserver variability, which often leads to inappropriate treatment with immunosuppressive drugs, unnecessary follow-up biopsies and poor transplant outcomes. Here we present a deep learning-based artificial intelligence (AI) system for automated assessment of gigapixel whole-slide images obtained from EMBs, which simultaneously addresses detection, subtyping and grading of allograft rejection. To assess model performance, we curated a large dataset from the United States, as well as independent test cohorts from Turkey and Switzerland, which includes large-scale variability across populations, sample preparations and slide scanning instrumentation. The model detects allograft rejection with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.962; assesses the cellular and antibody-mediated rejection type with AUCs of 0.958 and 0.874, respectively; detects Quilty B lesions, benign mimics of rejection, with an AUC of 0.939; and differentiates between low-grade and high-grade rejections with an AUC of 0.833. In a human reader study, the AI system showed non-inferior performance to conventional assessment and reduced interobserver variability and assessment time. This robust evaluation of cardiac allograft rejection paves the way for clinical trials to establish the efficacy of AI-assisted EMB assessment and its potential for improving heart transplant outcomes.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Navigation of frameless fixation for gamma knife radiosurgery using fixed augmented reality,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-08390-y,16 Mar 2022,"Augmented reality (AR) offers a new medical treatment approach. We aimed to evaluate frameless (mask) fixation navigation using a 3D-printed patient model with fixed-AR technology for gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS). Fixed-AR navigation was developed using the inside-out method with visual inertial odometry algorithms, and the flexible Quick Response marker was created for object-feature recognition. Virtual 3D-patient models for AR-rendering were created via 3D-scanning utilizing TrueDepth and cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) to generate a new GammaKnife Icon™ model. A 3D-printed patient model included fiducial markers, and virtual 3D-patient models were used to validate registration accuracy. Registration accuracy between initial frameless fixation and re-fixation navigated fixed-AR was validated through visualization and quantitative method. The quantitative method was validated through set-up errors, fiducial marker coordinates, and high-definition motion management (HDMM) values. A 3D-printed model and virtual models were correctly overlapped under frameless fixation. Virtual models from both 3D-scanning and CBCT were enough to tolerate the navigated frameless re-fixation. Although the CBCT virtual model consistently delivered more accurate results, 3D-scanning was sufficient. Frameless re-fixation accuracy navigated in virtual models had mean set-up errors within 1 mm and 1.5° in all axes. Mean fiducial marker differences from coordinates in virtual models were within 2.5 mm in all axes, and mean 3D errors were within 3 mm. Mean HDMM difference values in virtual models were within 1.5 mm of initial HDMM values. The variability from navigation fixed-AR is enough to consider repositioning frameless fixation without CBCT scanning for treating patients fractionated with large multiple metastases lesions (> 3 cm) who have difficulty enduring long beam-on time. This system could be applied to novel GKRS navigation for frameless fixation with reduced preparation time.","We demonstrated that fixed-AR navigation is a useful tool for frameless fixation without CBCT for GKRS. This method using conventional equipment and fixed-AR with inside-out tracking could be directly adapted to GKRS. Overall, when planning for small lesions or eloquent areas, frameless fixation and repositioning with CBCT scanning should be considered. However, in cases of patients with large metastases, no eloquent area and continual movements under frameless fixation could be navigated well with re-fixation and repositioning using a fixed-AR system without CBCT scanning.",Gen AI,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

A fully 3D patient-level CNN classifier on baseline CT images is used as feature extractor. Features extracted, alongside with laboratory and clinical data, are fed for selection in a Boruta algorithm with SHAP game theoretical values. A classifier is built on the reduced feature space using CatBoost gradient boosting algorithm and reaching a probabilistic AUC of 0.949 on holdout test set.

Accuracy (Acc), Specificity (Spe), Sensitivity (Sen), F1 score (F1), Matthews correlation coefficient (Mcc) values were included as performance criteria and Minitab 17 package program was used in descriptive statistical analyses. p ≤ 0.05 value was considered as statistically significant. In ML algorithms, the highest prediction was found with 0.90 Acc, 0.80 Mcc, 0.90 Spe, 0.90 Sen, 0.90 F1 values as a result of LR algorithms. As a result of confusion matrix, it was found that 27 of 30 males and 27 of 30 females were predicted correctly. Acc ratios of other MLs were found to be between 0.81 and 0.88.

This study aims to search for the optimal machine learning (ML) model to classify early and late MCI (EMCI and LMCI) subtypes using multimodal MRI data. First, the tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) analyses showed LMCI-related white matter changes in the Corpus Callosum. The ROI-based tractography addressed the connected cortical areas by affected callosal fibers. We then prepared two feature subsets for ML by measuring resting-state functional connectivity (TBSS-RSFC method) and graph theory metrics (TBSS-Graph method) in these cortical areas, respectively. We also prepared feature subsets of diffusion parameters in the regions of LMCI-related white matter alterations detected by TBSS analyses. Using these feature subsets, we trained and tested multiple ML models for EMCI/LMCI classification with cross-validation. Our results showed the ensemble ML model (AdaBoost) with feature subset of diffusion parameters achieved better performance of mean accuracy 70%. The useful brain regions for classification were those, including frontal, parietal lobe, Corpus Callosum, cingulate regions, insula, and thalamus regions.

Large scale validation of an early-age eye-tracking biomarker of an autism spectrum disorder subtype,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-08102-6,11 Mar 2022,"Few clinically validated biomarkers of ASD exist which can rapidly, accurately, and objectively identify autism during the first years of life and be used to support optimized treatment outcomes and advances in precision medicine. As such, the goal of the present study was to leverage both simple and computationally-advanced approaches to validate an eye-tracking measure of social attention preference, the GeoPref Test, among 1,863 ASD, delayed, or typical toddlers (12–48 months) referred from the community or general population via a primary care universal screening program. Toddlers participated in diagnostic and psychometric evaluations and the GeoPref Test: a 1-min movie containing side-by-side dynamic social and geometric images. Following testing, diagnosis was denoted as ASD, ASD features, LD, GDD, Other, typical sibling of ASD proband, or typical. Relative to other diagnostic groups, ASD toddlers exhibited the highest levels of visual attention towards geometric images and those with especially high fixation levels exhibited poor clinical profiles. Using the 69% fixation threshold, the GeoPref Test had 98% specificity, 17% sensitivity, 81% PPV, and 65% NPV. Sensitivity increased to 33% when saccades were included, with comparable validity across sex, ethnicity, or race. The GeoPref Test was also highly reliable up to 24 months following the initial test. Finally, fixation levels among twins concordant for ASD were significantly correlated, indicating that GeoPref Test performance may be genetically driven. As the GeoPref Test yields few false positives (~ 2%) and is equally valid across demographic categories, the current findings highlight the ability of the GeoPref Test to rapidly and accurately detect autism before the 2nd birthday in a subset of children and serve as a biomarker for a unique ASD subtype in clinical trials.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Quantitative interocular comparison of total corneal surface area and corneal diameter in patients with highly asymmetric keratoconus,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-08021-6,11 Mar 2022,"Keratoconus is a progressive corneal disorder which is frequently asymmetric. The aetiology of keratoconus remains unclear, and the concept of keratoconus as an ectatic disorder has been challenged recently. We carried out a retrospective study in 160 eyes of 80 patients, to evaluate and compare interocular differences in corneal diameter and surface area in patients with unilateral or highly asymmetric keratoconus (UHAKC). Calculations were performed using raw topographic elevation data derived from topographic measurements using Orbscan II, and we extrapolated surface areas up to measured corneal diameter. We also evaluated inter-eye correlation, and correlation between corneal surface area, corneal diameter and keratoconus severity. Our results showed a statistically significant but not clinically important greater corneal diameter (12.14 mm and 12.17 mm; p = 0.04), and corneal surface area (paired t-test, p < 0.0001; p = 0.0009 respectively) in more affected eyes. Inter-eye comparison revealed corneal diameter, anterior chamber depth, and corneal surface area were strongly correlated between eyes. Corneal surface area remained strongly correlated, and Bland–Altman analysis also showed strong inter-ocular agreement. Our results show that in patients with UHAKC the interocular difference in corneal diameter and corneal surface area is clinically insignificant, and are consistent with a redistribution, rather than increase, of corneal surface area with keratoconus progression.",Conclusions not available,Gen AI,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Prediction of hearing recovery in unilateral sudden sensorineural hearing loss using artificial intelligence,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-07881-2,10 Mar 2022,"Despite the significance of predicting the prognosis of idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSNHL), no predictive models have been established. This study used artificial intelligence to develop prognosis models to predict recovery from ISSNHL. We retrospectively reviewed the medical data of 453 patients with ISSNHL (men, 220; women, 233; mean age, 50.3 years) who underwent treatment at a tertiary hospital between January 2021 and December 2019 and were followed up after 1 month. According to Siegel’s criteria, 203 patients recovered in 1 month. Demographic characteristics, clinical and laboratory data, and pure-tone audiometry were analyzed. Logistic regression (baseline), a support vector machine, extreme gradient boosting, a light gradient boosting machine, and multilayer perceptron were used. The outcomes were the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) primarily, area under the precision-recall curve, Brier score, balanced accuracy, and F1 score. The light gradient boosting machine model had the best AUROC and balanced accuracy. Together with multilayer perceptron, it was also significantly superior to logistic regression in terms of AUROC. Using the SHapley Additive exPlanation method, we found that the initial audiogram shape is the most important prognostic factor.

Impact of urban structure on infectious disease spreading,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-06720-8,09 Mar 2022,"The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has been holding the world hostage for several years now. Mobility is key to viral spreading and its restriction is the main non-pharmaceutical interventions to fight the virus expansion. Previous works have shown a connection between the structural organization of cities and the movement patterns of their residents. This puts urban centers in the focus of epidemic surveillance and interventions. Here we show that the organization of urban flows has a tremendous impact on disease spreading and on the amenability of different mitigation strategies. By studying anonymous and aggregated intra-urban flows in a variety of cities in the United States and other countries, and a combination of empirical analysis and analytical methods, we demonstrate that the response of cities to epidemic spreading can be roughly classified in two major types according to the overall organization of those flows. Hierarchical cities, where flows are concentrated primarily between mobility hotspots, are particularly vulnerable to the rapid spread of epidemics. Nevertheless, mobility restrictions in such types of cities are very effective in mitigating the spread of a virus. Conversely, in sprawled cities which present many centers of activity, the spread of an epidemic is much slower, but the response to mobility restrictions is much weaker and less effective. Investing resources on early monitoring and prompt ad-hoc interventions in more vulnerable cities may prove helpful in containing and reducing the impact of future pandemics.",Conclusions not available,Gen AI,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: ; Attacker Capability: 
Prediction of treatment outcome in clinical trials under a personalized medicine perspective,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-07801-4,08 Mar 2022,"A central problem in most data-driven personalized medicine scenarios is the estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects to stratify individuals into subpopulations that differ in their susceptibility to a particular disease or response to a specific treatment. In this work, with an illustrative example on type 2 diabetes we showed how the increasing ability to access and analyzed open data from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) allows to build Machine Learning applications in a framework of personalized medicine. An ensemble machine learning predictive model is first developed and then applied to estimate the expected treatment response according to the medication that would be prescribed. Machine learning is quickly becoming indispensable to bridge science and clinical practice, but it is not sufficient on its own. A collaborative effort is requested to clinicians, statisticians, and computer scientists to strengthen tools built on machine learning to take advantage of this evidence flow.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
The image-based preoperative fistula risk score (preFRS) predicts postoperative pancreatic fistula in patients undergoing pancreatic head resection,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-07970-2,08 Mar 2022,"Clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula (CR-POPF) is a common severe surgical complication after pancreatic surgery. Current risk stratification systems mostly rely on intraoperatively assessed factors like manually determined gland texture or blood loss. We developed a preoperatively available image-based risk score predicting CR-POPF as a complication of pancreatic head resection. Frequency of CR-POPF and occurrence of salvage completion pancreatectomy during the hospital stay were associated with an intraoperative surgical (sFRS) and image-based preoperative CT-based (rFRS) fistula risk score, both considering pancreatic gland texture, pancreatic duct diameter and pathology, in 195 patients undergoing pancreatic head resection. Based on its association with fistula-related outcome, radiologically estimated pancreatic remnant volume was included in a preoperative (preFRS) score for POPF risk stratification. Intraoperatively assessed pancreatic duct diameter (p < 0.001), gland texture (p < 0.001) and high-risk pathology (p < 0.001) as well as radiographically determined pancreatic duct diameter (p < 0.001), gland texture (p < 0.001), high-risk pathology (p = 0.001), and estimated pancreatic remnant volume (p < 0.001) correlated with the risk of CR-POPF development. PreFRS predicted the risk of CR-POPF development (AUC = 0.83) and correlated with the risk of rescue completion pancreatectomy. In summary, preFRS facilitates preoperative POPF risk stratification in patients undergoing pancreatic head resection, enabling individualized therapeutic approaches and optimized perioperative management.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Deep learning based sarcopenia prediction from shear-wave ultrasonographic elastography and gray scale ultrasonography of rectus femoris muscle,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-07683-6,04 Mar 2022,"We aim to evaluate the performance of a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) in predicting the presence or absence of sarcopenia using shear-wave elastography (SWE) and gray-scale ultrasonography (GSU) of rectus femoris muscle as an imaging biomarker. This retrospective study included 160 pair sets of GSU and SWE images (n = 160) from December 2018 and July 2019. Two radiologists scored the echogenicity of muscle on GSU (4-point score). Among them, 141 patients underwent CT and their L3 skeletal muscle index (SMI) were measured to categorize the presence or absence of sarcopenia. For DCNN, we used three CNN architectures (VGG19, ResNet-50, DenseNet 121). The accuracies of DCNNs for sarcopenia classification were 70.0–80.0% (based on SWE) and 65.0–75.0% (based on GSU). The DCNN application to SWE images highlights the utility of deep-learning base SWE for sarcopenia prediction.

A reference set of clinically relevant adverse drug-drug interactions,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01159-y,04 Mar 2022,"The accurate and timely detection of adverse drug-drug interactions (DDIs) during the postmarketing phase is an important yet complex task with potentially major clinical implications. The development of data mining methodologies that scan healthcare databases for drug safety signals requires appropriate reference sets for performance evaluation. Methodologies for establishing DDI reference sets are limited in the literature, while there is no publicly available resource simultaneously focusing on clinical relevance of DDIs and individual behaviour of interacting drugs. By automatically extracting and aggregating information from multiple clinical resources, we provide a scalable approach for generating a reference set for DDIs that could support research in postmarketing safety surveillance. CRESCENDDI contains 10,286 positive and 4,544 negative controls, covering 454 drugs and 179 adverse events mapped to RxNorm and MedDRA concepts, respectively. It also includes single drug information for the included drugs (i.e., adverse drug reactions, indications, and negative drug-event associations).

Identification of antimicrobial peptides from the human gut microbiome using deep learning,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-022-01226-0,03 Mar 2022,"The human gut microbiome encodes a large variety of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), but the short lengths of AMPs pose a challenge for computational prediction. Here we combined multiple natural language processing neural network models, including LSTM, Attention and BERT, to form a unified pipeline for candidate AMP identification from human gut microbiome data. Of 2,349 sequences identified as candidate AMPs, 216 were chemically synthesized, with 181 showing antimicrobial activity (a positive rate of >83%). Most of these peptides have less than 40% sequence homology to AMPs in the training set. Further characterization of the 11 most potent AMPs showed high efficacy against antibiotic-resistant, Gram-negative pathogens and demonstrated significant efficacy in lowering bacterial load by more than tenfold against a mouse model of bacterial lung infection. Our study showcases the potential of machine learning approaches for mining functional peptides from metagenome data and accelerating the discovery of promising AMP candidate molecules for in-depth investigations.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Federated learning for multi-center imaging diagnostics: a simulation study in cardiovascular disease,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-07186-4,03 Mar 2022,"Deep learning models can enable accurate and efficient disease diagnosis, but have thus far been hampered by the data scarcity present in the medical world. Automated diagnosis studies have been constrained by underpowered single-center datasets, and although some results have shown promise, their generalizability to other institutions remains questionable as the data heterogeneity between institutions is not taken into account. By allowing models to be trained in a distributed manner that preserves patients’ privacy, federated learning promises to alleviate these issues, by enabling diligent multi-center studies. We present the first simulated federated learning study on the modality of cardiovascular magnetic resonance and use four centers derived from subsets of the M&M and ACDC datasets, focusing on the diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. We adapt a 3D-CNN network pretrained on action recognition and explore two different ways of incorporating shape prior information to the model, and four different data augmentation set-ups, systematically analyzing their impact on the different collaborative learning choices. We show that despite the small size of data (180 subjects derived from four centers), the privacy preserving federated learning achieves promising results that are competitive with traditional centralized learning. We further find that federatively trained models exhibit increased robustness and are more sensitive to domain shift effects.","In conclusion, through extensive analysis and experiments, we demonstrated that, even with a small sample size of 180 subjects derived from four centers, federated learning for Cardiac MRI diagnosis achieves promising performance that is comparable to collaborative data sharing. We highlighted the importance of a principled evaluation that accounts for both in and out of site performance and showed how models trained under a federated learning framework exhibit increased robustness and can be more sensitive to domain shift effects. As different centers seem to benefit in different ways from the interplay of augmentations and the collaborative learning frameworks, we believe that further research is required to delineate the underlying factors. In the future, bigger datasets with a wider diversity of centers should be used to systematically analyze and further verify these effects. Furthermore, our study was constrained to binary classification, but in the future semi-supervised federated learning methods will be needed to integrate labels that don’t fully overlap between centers to enable multi-label classification. Also, as we used segmentation masks supplied by clinicians, the current pipeline still relies on expert support to provide these segmentations and could be replaced by an automated federated segmentation pipeline, appended as a first step to the current pipeline.There is still a lot of fields in automated image-based diagnosis where federated learning has yet to make a presence, including prediction of prevalent diseases like retinopathy, diabetes, neurological disorders and cases of cancer in breast, liver or colon. Tangential fields like that of survival and treatment outcome prediction that are still underdeveloped due to the lack of data would also stand to benefit from the impact of federated learning and warrant similar exploration. We firmly believe that such studies will be a fundamental step to pave the way for multi-center studies going forward.","Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Detection of COVID-19 using multimodal data from a wearable device: results from the first TemPredict Study,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-07314-0,02 Mar 2022,"Early detection of diseases such as COVID-19 could be a critical tool in reducing disease transmission by helping individuals recognize when they should self-isolate, seek testing, and obtain early medical intervention. Consumer wearable devices that continuously measure physiological metrics hold promise as tools for early illness detection. We gathered daily questionnaire data and physiological data using a consumer wearable (Oura Ring) from 63,153 participants, of whom 704 self-reported possible COVID-19 disease. We selected 73 of these 704 participants with reliable confirmation of COVID-19 by PCR testing and high-quality physiological data for algorithm training to identify onset of COVID-19 using machine learning classification. The algorithm identified COVID-19 an average of 2.75 days before participants sought diagnostic testing with a sensitivity of 82% and specificity of 63%. The receiving operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) was 0.819 (95% CI [0.809, 0.830]). Including continuous temperature yielded an AUC 4.9% higher than without this feature. For further validation, we obtained SARS CoV-2 antibody in a subset of participants and identified 10 additional participants who self-reported COVID-19 disease with antibody confirmation. The algorithm had an overall ROC AUC of 0.819 (95% CI [0.809, 0.830]), with a sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 80% in these additional participants. Finally, we observed substantial variation in accuracy based on age and biological sex. Findings highlight the importance of including temperature assessment, using continuous physiological features for alignment, and including diverse populations in algorithm development to optimize accuracy in COVID-19 detection from wearables.",Conclusions not available,Gen AI,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Exploring polygenic contributors to subgroups of comorbid conditions in autism spectrum disorder,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-07399-7,01 Mar 2022,"Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have heterogeneous comorbid conditions. This study examined whether comorbid conditions in ASD are associated with polygenic risk scores (PRS) of ASD or PRS of comorbid conditions in non-ASD specific populations. Genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data were obtained from 1386 patients with ASD from the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE) study. After excluding individuals with missing clinical information concerning comorbid conditions, a total of 707 patients were included in the study. A total of 18 subgroups of comorbid conditions (‘topics’) were identified using a machine learning algorithm, topic modeling. PRS for ASD were computed using a genome-wide association meta-analysis of 18,381 cases and 27,969 controls. From these 18 topics, Topic 6 (over-represented by allergies) (p = 1.72 × 10−3) and Topic 17 (over-represented by sensory processing issues such as low pain tolerance) (p = 0.037) were associated with PRS of ASD. The associations between these two topics and the multi-locus contributors to their corresponding comorbid conditions based on non-ASD specific populations were further explored. The results suggest that these two topics were not associated with the PRS of allergies and chronic pain disorder, respectively. Note that characteristics of the present AGRE sample and those samples used in the original GWAS for ASD, allergies, and chronic pain disorder, may differ due to significant clinical heterogeneity that exists in the ASD population. Additionally, the AGRE sample may be underpowered and therefore insensitive to weak PRS associations due to a relatively small sample size. Findings imply that susceptibility genes of ASD may contribute more to the occurrence of allergies and sensory processing issues in individuals with ASD, compared with the susceptibility genes for their corresponding phenotypes in non-ASD individuals. Since these comorbid conditions (i.e., allergies and pain sensory issues) may not be attributable to the corresponding comorbidity-specific biological factors in non-ASD individuals, clinical management for these comorbid conditions may still depend on treatments for core symptoms of ASD.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
A COVID-19 mortality prediction model for Korean patients using nationwide Korean disease control and prevention agency database,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-07051-4,28 Feb 2022,"The experience of the early nationwide COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea led to an early shortage of medical resources. For efficient resource allocation, accurate prediction of the prognosis or mortality of confirmed patients is essential. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop an accurate model for predicting COVID-19 mortality using epidemiolocal and clinical variables and for identifying a high-risk group of confirmed patients. Clinical and epidemiolocal variables of 4049 patients with confirmed COVID-19 between January 20, 2020 and April 30, 2020 collected by the Korean Disease Control and Prevention Agency were used. Among the 4049 total confirmed patients, 223 patients died, while 3826 patients were released from isolation. Patients who had the following risk factors showed significantly higher risk scores: age over 60 years, male sex, difficulty breathing, diabetes, cancer, dementia, change of consciousness, and hospitalization in the intensive care unit. High accuracy was shown for both the development set (n = 2467) and the validation set (n = 1582), with AUCs of 0.96 and 0.97, respectively. The prediction model developed in this study based on clinical features and epidemiological factors could be used for screening high-risk groups of patients and for evidence-based allocation of medical resources.",Conclusions not available,Traditional ML,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Intestinal microbiota signatures of clinical response and immune-related adverse events in melanoma patients treated with anti-PD-1,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-01698-2,28 Feb 2022,"Ample evidence indicates that the gut microbiome is a tumor-extrinsic factor associated with antitumor response to anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) therapy, but inconsistencies exist between published microbial signatures associated with clinical outcomes. To resolve this, we evaluated a new melanoma cohort, along with four published datasets. Time-to-event analysis showed that baseline microbiota composition was optimally associated with clinical outcome at approximately 1 year after initiation of treatment. Meta-analysis and other bioinformatic analyses of the combined data show that bacteria associated with favorable response are confined within the Actinobacteria phylum and the Lachnospiraceae/Ruminococcaceae families of Firmicutes. Conversely, Gram-negative bacteria were associated with an inflammatory host intestinal gene signature, increased blood neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and unfavorable outcome. Two microbial signatures, enriched for Lachnospiraceae spp. and Streptococcaceae spp., were associated with favorable and unfavorable clinical response, respectively, and with distinct immune-related adverse effects. Despite between-cohort heterogeneity, optimized all-minus-one supervised learning algorithms trained on batch-corrected microbiome data consistently predicted outcomes to programmed cell death protein-1 therapy in all cohorts. Gut microbial communities (microbiotypes) with nonuniform geographical distribution were associated with favorable and unfavorable outcomes, contributing to discrepancies between cohorts. Our findings shed new light on the complex interaction between the gut microbiome and response to cancer immunotherapy, providing a roadmap for future studies.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: evasion; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Intra-topic latency as an automated behavioral marker of treatment response in autism spectrum disorder,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-07299-w,28 Feb 2022,"Data science advances in behavioral signal processing and machine learning hold the promise to automatically quantify clinically meaningful behaviors that can be applied to a large amount of data. The objective of this study was to identify an automated behavioral marker of treatment response in social communication in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). First, using an automated computational method, we successfully derived the amount of time it took for a child with ASD and an adult social partner (N pairs = 210) to respond to each other while they were engaged in conversation bits (“latency”) using recordings of brief, natural social interactions. Then, we measured changes in latency at pre- and post-interventions. Children with ASD who were receiving interventions showed significantly larger reduction in latency compared to those who were not receiving interventions. There was also a significant group difference in the changes in latency for adult social partners. Results suggest that the automated measure of latency derived from natural social interactions is a scalable and objective method to quantify treatment response in children with ASD.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: ; Attacker Capability: 
MIXTURE of human expertise and deep learning—developing an explainable model for predicting pathological diagnosis and survival in patients with interstitial lung disease,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41379-022-01025-7,23 Feb 2022,"Interstitial pneumonia is a heterogeneous disease with a progressive course and poor prognosis, at times even worse than those in the main cancer types. Histopathological examination is crucial for its diagnosis and estimation of prognosis. However, the evaluation strongly depends on the experience of pathologists, and the reproducibility of diagnosis is low. Herein, we propose MIXTURE (huMan-In-the-loop eXplainable artificial intelligence Through the Use of REcurrent training), an original method to develop deep learning models for extracting pathologically significant findings based on an expert pathologist’s perspective with a small annotation effort. The procedure of MIXTURE consists of three steps as follows. First, we created feature extractors for tiles from whole slide images using self-supervised learning. The similar looking tiles were clustered based on the output features and then pathologists integrated the pathologically synonymous clusters. Using the integrated clusters as labeled data, deep learning models to classify the tiles into pathological findings were created by transfer-learning the feature extractors. We developed three models for different magnifications. Using these extracted findings, our model was able to predict the diagnosis of usual interstitial pneumonia, a finding suggestive of progressive disease, with high accuracy (AUC 0.90 in validation set and AUC 0.86 in test set). This high accuracy could not be achieved without the integration of findings by pathologists. The patients predicted as UIP had poorer prognosis (5-year overall survival [OS]: 55.4%) than those predicted as non-UIP (OS: 95.2%). The Cox proportional hazards model for each microscopic finding and prognosis pointed out dense fibrosis, fibroblastic foci, elastosis, and lymphocyte aggregation as independent risk factors. We suggest that MIXTURE may serve as a model approach to different diseases evaluated by medical imaging, including pathology and radiology, and be the prototype for explainable artificial intelligence that can collaborate with humans.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Segmentation of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and surrounding vessels in CT images using deep convolutional neural networks and texture descriptors,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-07111-9,23 Feb 2022,"Fully automated and volumetric segmentation of critical tumors may play a crucial role in diagnosis and surgical planning. One of the most challenging tumor segmentation tasks is localization of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Exclusive application of conventional methods does not appear promising. Deep learning approaches has achieved great success in the computer aided diagnosis, especially in biomedical image segmentation. This paper introduces a framework based on convolutional neural network (CNN) for segmentation of PDAC mass and surrounding vessels in CT images by incorporating powerful classic features, as well. First, a 3D-CNN architecture is used to localize the pancreas region from the whole CT volume using 3D Local Binary Pattern (LBP) map of the original image. Segmentation of PDAC mass is subsequently performed using 2D attention U-Net and Texture Attention U-Net (TAU-Net). TAU-Net is introduced by fusion of dense Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) and LBP descriptors into the attention U-Net. An ensemble model is then used to cumulate the advantages of both networks using a 3D-CNN. In addition, to reduce the effects of imbalanced data, a multi-objective loss function is proposed as a weighted combination of three classic losses including Generalized Dice Loss (GDL), Weighted Pixel-Wise Cross Entropy loss (WPCE) and boundary loss. Due to insufficient sample size for vessel segmentation, we used the above-mentioned pre-trained networks and fine-tuned them. Experimental results show that the proposed method improves the Dice score for PDAC mass segmentation in portal-venous phase by 7.52% compared to state-of-the-art methods in term of DSC. Besides, three dimensional visualization of the tumor and surrounding vessels can facilitate the evaluation of PDAC treatment response.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Current practice involves invasive testing and excisional biopsy to diagnose NTM lymphadenitis. In this study, we performed a retrospective analysis of 249 lymph nodes selected from 143 CT scans of pediatric patients presenting with lymphadenopathy at the Montreal Children’s Hospital between 2005 and 2018. A Random Forest classifier was trained on the ten most discriminative features from a set of 1231 radiomic features. The model classifying nodes as pyogenic, NTM, reactive, or proliferative lymphadenopathy achieved an accuracy of 72%, a precision of 68%, and a recall of 70%. Between NTM and all other causes of lymphadenopathy, the model achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 89%. Between NTM and pyogenic lymphadenitis, the model achieved an AUC of 90%. Between NTM and the reactive and proliferative lymphadenopathy groups, the model achieved an AUC of 93%. These results indicate that radiomics can achieve a high accuracy for classification of NTM lymphadenitis. Such a non-invasive highly accurate diagnostic approach has the potential to reduce the need for invasive procedures in the pediatric population.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Patient-specific 3D-printed shelf implant for the treatment of hip dysplasia tested in an experimental animal pilot in canines,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-06989-9,22 Feb 2022,"The concept of a novel patient-specific 3D-printed shelf implant should be evaluated in a relevant large animal model with hip dysplasia. Therefore, three dogs with radiographic bilateral hip dysplasia and a positive subluxation test underwent unilateral acetabular augmentation with a 3D-printed dog-specific titanium implant. The contralateral side served as control. The implants were designed on CT-based pelvic bone segmentations and extended the dysplastic acetabular rim to increase the weight bearing surface without impairing the range of motion. Outcome was assessed by clinical observation, manual subluxation testing, radiography, CT, and gait analysis from 6 weeks preoperatively until termination at 26 weeks postoperatively. Thereafter, all hip joints underwent histopathological examination. The implantation and recovery from surgery was uneventful. Clinical subluxation tests at the intervention side became negative. Imaging showed medialization of the femoral head at the intervention side and the mean (range) CE-angle increased from 94° (84°–99°) preoperative to 119° (117°–120°) postoperative. Gait analysis parameters returned to pre-operative levels after an average follow-up of 6 weeks. Histology showed a thickened synovial capsule between the implant and the femoral head without any evidence of additional damage to the articular cartilage compared to the control side. The surgical implantation of the 3D shelf was safe and feasible. The patient-specific 3D-printed shelf implants restored the femoral head coverage and stability of dysplastic hips without complications. The presented approach holds promise to treat residual hip dysplasia justifying future veterinary clinical trials to establish clinical effectiveness in a larger cohort to prepare for translation to human clinic.",Conclusions not available,,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Machine learning methods to predict presence of residual cancer following hysterectomy,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-06585-x,17 Feb 2022,"Surgical management for gynecologic malignancies often involves hysterectomy, often constituting the most common gynecologic surgery worldwide. Despite maximal surgical and medical care, gynecologic malignancies have a high rate of recurrence following surgery. Current machine learning models use advanced pathology data that is often inaccessible within low-resource settings and are specific to singular cancer types. There is currently a need for machine learning models to predict non-clinically evident residual disease using only clinically available health data. Here we developed and tested multiple machine learning models to assess the risk of residual disease post-hysterectomy based on clinical and operative parameters. Data from 3656 hysterectomy patients from the NSQIP dataset over 14 years were used to develop models with a training set of 2925 patients and a validation set of 731 patients. Our models revealed the top postoperative predictors of residual disease were the initial presence of gross abdominal disease on the diaphragm, disease located on the bowel mesentery, located on the bowel serosa, and disease located within the adjacent pelvis prior to resection. There were no statistically significant differences in performances of the top three models. Extreme gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression models had comparable AUC ROC (0.90) and accuracy metrics (87–88%). Using these models, physicians can identify gynecologic cancer patients post-hysterectomy that may benefit from additional treatment. For patients at high risk for disease recurrence despite adequate surgical intervention, machine learning models may lay the basis for potential prospective trials with prophylactic/adjuvant therapy for non-clinically evident residual disease, particularly in under-resourced settings.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) has become a prime technique for AMD diagnosis, specifically for late-stage neovascular (NV) AMD. Such technologies generate massive amounts of data, challenging to parse by experts alone, transforming artificial intelligence into a valuable partner. We describe a deep learning (DL) approach which achieves multi-class detection of non-AMD vs. non-neovascular (NNV) AMD vs. NV AMD from a combination of OCTA, OCT structure, 2D b-scan flow images, and high definition (HD) 5-line b-scan cubes; DL also detects ocular biomarkers indicative of AMD risk. Multimodal data were used as input to 2D-3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Both for CNNs and experts, choroidal neovascularization and geographic atrophy were found to be important biomarkers for AMD. CNNs predict biomarkers with accuracy up to 90.2% (positive-predictive-value up to 75.8%). Just as experts rely on multimodal data to diagnose AMD, CNNs also performed best when trained on multiple inputs combined. Detection of AMD and its biomarkers from OCTA data via CNNs has tremendous potential to expedite screening of early and late-stage AMD patients.","All models described here achieved above-chance multi-class performance at detection of Non-AMD vs. early and late stages of NNV AMD vs. NV AMD, suggesting promise for translating our approach to the clinic. By leveraging existing strengths of state-of-the-art CNN architectures, such as feature concatenation via long skip connections, our study paves the way for optimization of our top-performing CNN architectures [models (4) and (9)] for the best input modalities discovered here (combining OCTA, OCT structure, and b-scans). Model (4), combining OCTA, OCT structure, and HD 5-line b-scans and model (9), combining OCTA, OCT structure, HD 5-line b-scans, and 2D b-scan flow images exhibited best performance compared to single and dual modality combinations of OCTA, OCT structure, and b-scan information. Current limitations in the form of overfitting of our models could potentially be improved by using an asymmetric loss function25, customized for handling class imbalance by more heavily weighting samples of a class present in lower quantity. Adding residual blocks or replacing conventional convolutional kernels with spatial or depth-wise separable kernels may help improve accuracy26,27. Attempting to leverage knowledge gained from low-resolution 2D b-scan flow images to inform utility of HD 5-line b-scan cubes (or vice versa) may further help to reduce the parameter space and thus prevent overfitting, by enhancing emphasis on the most critical layers/images. Salvi and colleagues28 describe a number of pre-processing as well as post-processing techniques (including de-speckling) that help improve deep learning model performance. Although speckle noise is typically the predominant source of noise in OCT, we did not observe speckle noise as a significant issue in our data; we anticipate that incorporation of pre-processing approaches such as data augmentation may potentially improve model performance in future iterations of this work. Among biomarkers included in our labeling analysis, experts and CNNs agree on CNV and GA as the top two with highest odds for any (NNV + NV) AMD diagnosis when present and agree on CNV presence as indicating high odds of NV AMD diagnosis, helping to build trust/credibility in such AI technology. Consistency between experts and CNNs for features predictive of NV AMD may be enhanced by segmentation/localization of image biomarkers within b-scans beyond simply detection of biomarker presence. Using CNN feature predictions in tandem with the clinical algorithm enabled improvement in sensitivity and specificity of NV AMD detection, compared to CNN image-level disease classification. Grad-CAMs serve a valuable role to further explain CNN mechanism of function, as they showed that CNNs are detecting CNV presence in true positive OCTA, structural, and b-scan images. Detection of late-stage AMD and presence of AMD biomarkers from OCTA/OCT structural images and b-scans via CNNs has tremendous potential for translation to the clinic to expedite workflow for screening of early and late-stage AMD patients.",DNN,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Early heart rate variability evaluation enables to predict ICU patients’ outcome,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-06301-9,15 Feb 2022,"Heart rate variability (HRV) is a mean to evaluate cardiac effects of autonomic nervous system activity, and a relation between HRV and outcome has been proposed in various types of patients. We attempted to evaluate the best determinants of such variation in survival prediction using a physiological data-warehousing program. Plethysmogram tracings (PPG) were recorded at 75 Hz from the standard monitoring system, for a 2 h period, during the 24 h following ICU admission. Physiological data recording was associated with metadata collection. HRV was derived from PPG in either the temporal and non-linear domains. 540 consecutive patients were recorded. A lower LF/HF, SD2/SD1 ratios and Shannon entropy values on admission were associated with a higher ICU mortality. SpO2/FiO2 ratio and HRV parameters (LF/HF and Shannon entropy) were independent correlated with mortality in the multivariate analysis. Machine-learning using neural network (kNN) enabled to determine a simple decision tree combining the three best determinants (SDNN, Shannon Entropy, SD2/SD1 ratio) of a composite outcome index. HRV measured on admission enables to predict outcome in the ICU or at Day-28, independently of the admission diagnosis, treatment and mechanical ventilation requirement.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Care-seeking and delay of care during COPD exacerbations,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41533-022-00269-9,15 Feb 2022,"Patients who receive earlier treatment for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have a better prognosis, including earlier symptom resolution and reduced risk of future emergency-department visits (ED) or hospitalizations. However, many patients delay seeking care or do not report worsening symptoms to their healthcare provider. In this study, we aimed to understand how patients perceived their breathing symptoms and identify factors that led to seeking or delaying care for an acute exacerbation of COPD. We conducted semistructured interviews with 60 individuals following a recent COPD exacerbation. Participants were identified from a larger study of outpatients with COPD by purposive sampling by exacerbation type: 15 untreated, 15 treated with prednisone and/or antibiotics in the outpatient setting, 16 treated in an urgent care or ED setting, and 14 hospitalized. Data were analyzed using inductive content analysis. Participants were primarily male (97%) with a mean age of 69.1 ± 6.9 years, mean FEV1 1.42 (±0.63), and mean mMRC dyspnea of 2.7 (±1.1). We identified 4 primary themes: (i) access and attitudinal barriers contribute to reluctance to seek care, (ii) waiting is a typical response to new exacerbations, (iii) transitioning from waiting to care-seeking: the tipping point, and (iv) learning from and avoiding worse outcomes. Interventions to encourage earlier care-seeking for COPD exacerbations should consider individuals’ existing self-management approaches, address attitudinal barriers to seeking care, and consider health-system changes to increase access to non-emergent outpatient treatment for exacerbations.",Conclusions not available,Gen AI,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Gut metagenome associations with extensive digital health data in a volunteer-based Estonian microbiome cohort,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-28464-9,15 Feb 2022,"Microbiome research is starting to move beyond the exploratory phase towards interventional trials and therefore well-characterized cohorts will be instrumental for generating hypotheses and providing new knowledge. As part of the Estonian Biobank, we established the Estonian Microbiome Cohort which includes stool, oral and plasma samples from 2509 participants and is supplemented with multi-omic measurements, questionnaires, and regular linkages to national electronic health records. Here we analyze stool data from deep metagenomic sequencing together with rich phenotyping, including 71 diseases, 136 medications, 21 dietary questions, 5 medical procedures, and 19 other factors. We identify numerous relationships (n = 3262) with different microbiome features. In this study, we extend the understanding of microbiome-host interactions using electronic health data and show that long-term antibiotic usage, independent from recent administration, has a significant impact on the microbiome composition, partly explaining the common associations between diseases.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Artificial intelligence in positioning between mandibular third molar and inferior alveolar nerve on panoramic radiography,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-06483-2,14 Feb 2022,"Determining the exact positional relationship between mandibular third molar (M3) and inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) is important for surgical extractions. Panoramic radiography is the most common dental imaging test. The purposes of this study were to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) model to determine two positional relationships (true contact and bucco-lingual position) between M3 and IAN when they were overlapped in panoramic radiographs and compare its performance with that of oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMFS) specialists. A total of 571 panoramic images of M3 from 394 patients was used for this study. Among the images, 202 were classified as true contact, 246 as intimate, 61 as IAN buccal position, and 62 as IAN lingual position. A deep convolutional neural network model with ResNet-50 architecture was trained for each task. We randomly split the dataset into 75% for training and validation and 25% for testing. Model performance was superior in bucco-lingual position determination (accuracy 0.76, precision 0.83, recall 0.67, and F1 score 0.73) to true contact position determination (accuracy 0.63, precision 0.62, recall 0.63, and F1 score 0.61). AI exhibited much higher accuracy in both position determinations compared to OMFS specialists. In determining true contact position, OMFS specialists demonstrated an accuracy of 52.68% to 69.64%, while the AI showed an accuracy of 72.32%. In determining bucco-lingual position, OMFS specialists showed an accuracy of 32.26% to 48.39%, and the AI showed an accuracy of 80.65%. Moreover, Cohen’s kappa exhibited a substantial level of agreement for the AI (0.61) and poor agreements for OMFS specialists in bucco-lingual position determination. Determining the position relationship between M3 and IAN is possible using AI, especially in bucco-lingual positioning. The model could be used to support clinicians in the decision-making process for M3 treatment.","In this study, we developed and validated a deep learning algorithm that determined positional relationship between M3 and IAN canal at a performance level superior to that of experts. Once tested prospectively in clinical settings, the algorithm could have the potential to narrow patient access to CBCT or prepare for surgical extraction.",DNN,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Deep learning-based high-accuracy quantitation for lumbar intervertebral disc degeneration from MRI,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-28387-5,11 Feb 2022,"To help doctors and patients evaluate lumbar intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) accurately and efficiently, we propose a segmentation network and a quantitation method for IVDD from T2MRI. A semantic segmentation network (BianqueNet) composed of three innovative modules achieves high-precision segmentation of IVDD-related regions. A quantitative method is used to calculate the signal intensity and geometric features of IVDD. Manual measurements have excellent agreement with automatic calculations, but the latter have better repeatability and efficiency. We investigate the relationship between IVDD parameters and demographic information (age, gender, position and IVDD grade) in a large population. Considering these parameters present strong correlation with IVDD grade, we establish a quantitative criterion for IVDD. This fully automated quantitation system for IVDD may provide more precise information for clinical practice, clinical trials, and mechanism investigation. It also would increase the number of patients that can be monitored.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Machine learning-aided risk prediction for metabolic syndrome based on 3 years study,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-06235-2,10 Feb 2022,"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a group of physiological states of metabolic disorders, which may increase the risk of diabetes, cardiovascular and other diseases. Therefore, it is of great significance to predict the onset of MetS and the corresponding risk factors. In this study, we investigate the risk prediction for MetS using a data set of 67,730 samples with physical examination records of three consecutive years provided by the Department of Health Management, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, P.R. China. Specifically, the prediction for MetS takes the numerical features of examination records as well as the differential features by using the examination records over the past two consecutive years, namely, the differential numerical feature (DNF) and the differential state feature (DSF), and the risk factors of the above features w.r.t different ages and genders are statistically analyzed. From numerical results, it is shown that the proposed DSF in addition to the numerical feature of examination records, significantly contributes to the risk prediction of MetS. Additionally, the proposed scheme, by using the proposed features, yields a superior performance to the state-of-the-art MetS prediction model, which provides the potential of effective prescreening the occurrence of MetS.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Machine learning-based diagnosis and risk factor analysis of cardiocerebrovascular disease based on KNHANES,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-06333-1,10 Feb 2022,"The prevalence of cardiocerebrovascular disease (CVD) is continuously increasing, and it is the leading cause of human death. Since it is difficult for physicians to screen thousands of people, high-accuracy and interpretable methods need to be presented. We developed four machine learning-based CVD classifiers (i.e., multi-layer perceptron, support vector machine, random forest, and light gradient boosting) based on the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. We resampled and rebalanced KNHANES data using complex sampling weights such that the rebalanced dataset mimics a uniformly sampled dataset from overall population. For clear risk factor analysis, we removed multicollinearity and CVD-irrelevant variables using VIF-based filtering and the Boruta algorithm. We applied synthetic minority oversampling technique and random undersampling before ML training. We demonstrated that the proposed classifiers achieved excellent performance with AUCs over 0.853. Using Shapley value-based risk factor analysis, we identified that the most significant risk factors of CVD were age, sex, and the prevalence of hypertension. Additionally, we identified that age, hypertension, and BMI were positively correlated with CVD prevalence, while sex (female), alcohol consumption and, monthly income were negative. The results showed that the feature selection and the class balancing technique effectively improve the interpretability of models.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
GestaltMatcher facilitates rare disease matching using facial phenotype descriptors,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-021-01010-x,10 Feb 2022,"Many monogenic disorders cause a characteristic facial morphology. Artificial intelligence can support physicians in recognizing these patterns by associating facial phenotypes with the underlying syndrome through training on thousands of patient photographs. However, this ‘supervised’ approach means that diagnoses are only possible if the disorder was part of the training set. To improve recognition of ultra-rare disorders, we developed GestaltMatcher, an encoder for portraits that is based on a deep convolutional neural network. Photographs of 17,560 patients with 1,115 rare disorders were used to define a Clinical Face Phenotype Space, in which distances between cases define syndromic similarity. Here we show that patients can be matched to others with the same molecular diagnosis even when the disorder was not included in the training set. Together with mutation data, GestaltMatcher could not only accelerate the clinical diagnosis of patients with ultra-rare disorders and facial dysmorphism but also enable the delineation of new phenotypes.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Foudroyant cerebral venous (sinus) thrombosis triggered through CLEC-2 and GPIIb/IIIa dependent platelet activation,https://www.nature.com/articles/s44161-021-00017-1,10 Feb 2022,"Cerebral venous (sinus) thrombosis (CVT) is an unusual manifestation of venous thrombosis causing severe neurological impairment and seizures1,2. Molecular mechanisms underlying CVT, potentially involving pathological platelet activation, are unknown. Here we show that antibody-(INU1-fab)-induced cooperative signaling of two platelet receptors, C-type lectin-like receptor-2 (CLEC-2) and GPIIb/IIIa, triggers within minutes a CVT-like thrombotic syndrome in mice, characterized by tonic–myoclonic seizures, platelet consumption and death. Brain autopsy showed thrombi mainly in the cortical venules, but no intracranial hemorrhages or edema formation. Transcranial intravital microscopy revealed rapidly progressing thrombosis in the superior sagittal sinus, a main site of CVT in humans. Interfering with CLEC-2 signaling or inhibition of GPIIb/IIIa completely blocked platelet activation and CVT. Blocking GPIIb/IIIa after onset of neurological symptoms protected mice from platelet consumption, CVT and death, which was not seen after treatment with heparin. These results point to aberrant platelet activation as a major trigger of CVT and potential target for treatment.",Conclusions not available,Gen AI,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Convolutional mesh autoencoders for the 3-dimensional identification of FGFR-related craniosynostosis,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-02411-y,09 Feb 2022,"Clinical diagnosis of craniofacial anomalies requires expert knowledge. Recent studies have shown that artificial intelligence (AI) based facial analysis can match the diagnostic capabilities of expert clinicians in syndrome identification. In general, these systems use 2D images and analyse texture and colour. They are powerful tools for photographic analysis but are not suitable for use with medical imaging modalities such as ultrasound, MRI or CT, and are unable to take shape information into consideration when making a diagnostic prediction. 3D morphable models (3DMMs), and their recently proposed successors, mesh autoencoders, analyse surface topography rather than texture enabling analysis from photography and all common medical imaging modalities and present an alternative to image-based analysis. We present a craniofacial analysis framework for syndrome identification using Convolutional Mesh Autoencoders (CMAs). The models were trained using 3D photographs of the general population (LSFM and LYHM), computed tomography data (CT) scans from healthy infants and patients with 3 genetically distinct craniofacial syndromes (Muenke, Crouzon, Apert). Machine diagnosis outperformed expert clinical diagnosis with an accuracy of 99.98%, sensitivity of 99.95% and specificity of 100%. The diagnostic precision of this technique supports its potential inclusion in clinical decision support systems. Its reliance on 3D topography characterisation make it suitable for AI assisted diagnosis in medical imaging as well as photographic analysis in the clinical setting.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

To address this unmet need, we introduce a Platform for Oncogenomic Reporting and Interpretation (PORI), comprising an analytic framework that facilitates the interpretation and reporting of somatic variants in cancer. PORI integrates reporting and graph knowledge base tools combined with support for manual curation at the reporting stage. PORI represents an open-source platform alternative to commercial reporting solutions suitable for comprehensive genomic data sets in precision oncology. We demonstrate the utility of PORI by matching 9,961 pan-cancer genome atlas tumours to the graph knowledge base, calculating therapeutically informative alterations, and making available reports describing select individual samples.",Conclusions not available,Gen AI,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Volatile organic compound profiling to explore primary graft dysfunction after lung transplantation,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-05994-2,08 Feb 2022,"Primary graft dysfunction (PGD) is a major determinant of morbidity and mortality following lung transplantation. Delineating basic mechanisms and molecular signatures of PGD remain a fundamental challenge. This pilot study examines if the pulmonary volatile organic compound (VOC) spectrum relate to PGD and postoperative outcomes. The VOC profiles of 58 bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and blind bronchial aspirate samples from 35 transplant patients were extracted using solid-phase-microextraction and analyzed with comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The support vector machine algorithm was used to identify VOCs that could differentiate patients with severe from lower grade PGD. Using 20 statistically significant VOCs from the sample headspace collected immediately after transplantation (< 6 h), severe PGD was differentiable from low PGD with an AUROC of 0.90 and an accuracy of 0.83 on test set samples. The model was somewhat effective for later time points with an AUROC of 0.80. Three major chemical classes in the model were dominated by alkylated hydrocarbons, linear hydrocarbons, and aldehydes in severe PGD samples. These VOCs may have important clinical and mechanistic implications, therefore large-scale study and potential translation to breath analysis is recommended.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
A pilot study for the prediction of liver function related scores using breath biomarkers and machine learning,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-05808-5,07 Feb 2022,"Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) present in exhaled breath can help in analysing biochemical processes in the human body. Liver diseases can be traced using VOCs as biomarkers for physiological and pathophysiological conditions. In this work, we propose non-invasive and quick breath monitoring approach for early detection and progress monitoring of liver diseases using Isoprene, Limonene, and Dimethyl sulphide (DMS) as potential biomarkers. A pilot study is performed to design a dataset that includes the biomarkers concentration analysed from the breath sample before and after study subjects performed an exercise. A machine learning approach is applied for the prediction of scores for liver function diagnosis. Four regression methods are performed to predict the clinical scores using breath biomarkers data as features set by the machine learning techniques. A significant difference was observed for isoprene concentration (p < 0.01) and for DMS concentration (p < 0.0001) between liver patients and healthy subject’s breath sample. The R-square value between actual clinical score and predicted clinical score is found to be 0.78, 0.82, and 0.85 for CTP score, APRI score, and MELD score, respectively.

In this work, we investigate the feasibility of utilizing quantum machine learning (QML) on real clinical datasets. We propose two QML algorithms for data classification on IBM quantum hardware: a quantum distance classifier (qDS) and a simplified quantum-kernel support vector machine (sqKSVM). We utilize these different methods using the linear time quantum data encoding technique (\({\mathrm{log}}_{2}N\)) for embedding classical data into quantum states and estimating the inner product on the 15-qubit IBMQ Melbourne quantum computer. We match the predictive performance of our QML approaches with prior QML methods and with their classical counterpart algorithms for three open-access clinical datasets. Our results imply that the qDS in small sample and feature count datasets outperforms kernel-based methods. In contrast, quantum kernel approaches outperform qDS in high sample and feature count datasets. We demonstrate that the \({\mathrm{log}}_{2}N\) encoding increases predictive performance with up to + 2% area under the receiver operator characteristics curve across all quantum machine learning approaches, thus, making it ideal for machine learning tasks executed in Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum computers.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Incorporating uncertainty in learning to defer algorithms for safe computer-aided diagnosis,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-05725-7,02 Feb 2022,"Deep neural networks are increasingly being used for computer-aided diagnosis, but erroneous diagnoses can be extremely costly for patients. We propose a learning to defer with uncertainty (LDU) algorithm which identifies patients for whom diagnostic uncertainty is high and defers them for evaluation by human experts. LDU was evaluated on the diagnosis of myocardial infarction (using discharge summaries), the diagnosis of any comorbidities (using structured data), and the diagnosis of pleural effusion and pneumothorax (using chest x-rays), and compared with ‘learning to defer without uncertainty information’ (LD) and ‘direct triage by uncertainty’ (DT) methods. LDU achieved the same F1 score as LD but deferred considerably fewer patients (e.g. 36% vs. 69% deferral rate for diagnosing pleural effusion with an F1 score of 0.96). Furthermore, even when many patients were assigned the wrong diagnosis with high confidence (e.g. for the diagnosis of any comorbidities) LDU achieved a 17% increase in F1 score, whereas DT was not applicable. Importantly, the weight of the defer loss in LDU can be easily adjusted to obtain the desired trade-off between diagnostic accuracy and deferral rate. In conclusion, LDU can readily augment any existing diagnostic network to reduce the risk of erroneous diagnoses in clinical practice.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Dynamic Bayesian networks for prediction of health status and treatment effect in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-05813-8,02 Feb 2022,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common blood cancer in adults. The course of CLL and patients' response to treatment are varied. This variability makes it difficult to select the most appropriate treatment regimen and predict the progression of the disease. This work was aimed at developing and validating dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) to predict changes of the health status of patients with CLL and progression of the disease over time. Two DBNs were developed and implemented i.e. Health Status Network (HSN) and Treatment Effect Network (TEN). Based on the literature data and expert knowledge we identified relationships linking the most important factors influencing the health status and treatment effects in patients with CLL. The developed networks, and in particular TEN, were able to predict probability of survival in patients with CLL, which was in line with the survival data collected in large medical registries. The networks can be used to personalize the predictions, taking into account a priori knowledge concerning a particular patient with CLL. The proposed approach can serve as a basis for the development of artificial intelligence systems that facilitate the choice of treatment that maximizes the chances of survival in patients with CLL.",Conclusions not available,,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Sensory stimulation-based protection from impending stroke following MCA occlusion is correlated with desynchronization of widespread spontaneous local field potentials,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-05604-1,02 Feb 2022,"In a rat model of ischemic stroke by permanent occlusion of the medial cerebral artery (pMCAo), we have demonstrated using continuous recordings by microelectrode array at the depth of the ischemic territory that there is an immediate wide-spread increase in spontaneous local field potential synchrony following pMCAo that was correlated with ischemic stroke damage, but such increase was not seen in control sham-surgery rats. We further found that the underpinning source of the synchrony increase is intermittent bursts of low multi-frequency oscillations. Here we show that such increase in spontaneous LFP synchrony after pMCAo can be reduced to pre-pMCAo baseline level by delivering early (immediately after pMCAo) protective sensory stimulation that reduced the underpinning bursts. However, the delivery of a late (3 h after pMCAo) destructive sensory stimulation had no influence on the elevated LFP synchrony and its underpinning bursts. Histology confirmed both protection for the early stimulation group and an infarct for the late stimulation group. These findings highlight the unexpected importance of spontaneous LFP and its synchrony as a predictive correlate of cerebral protection or stroke infarct during the hyperacute state following pMCAo and the potential clinical relevance of stimulation to reduce EEG synchrony in acute stroke.",Conclusions not available,Gen AI,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Using machine learning, we developed an approach to stratify patients with DLBCL into four subgroups based on survival characteristics. This approach uses data from the targeted transcriptome to predict these survival subgroups. Using the expression levels of 180 genes, our model reliably predicted the four survival subgroups and was validated using independent groups of patients. Multivariate analysis showed that this patient stratification strategy encompasses various biological characteristics of DLBCL, and only TP53 mutations remained an independent prognostic biomarker. This novel approach for stratifying patients with DLBCL, based on the clinical outcome of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone therapy, can be used to identify patients who may not respond well to these types of therapy, but would otherwise benefit from alternative therapy and clinical trials.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Sounds of COVID-19: exploring realistic performance of audio-based digital testing,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-021-00553-x,28 Jan 2022,"To identify Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases efficiently, affordably, and at scale, recent work has shown how audio (including cough, breathing and voice) based approaches can be used for testing. However, there is a lack of exploration of how biases and methodological decisions impact these tools’ performance in practice. In this paper, we explore the realistic performance of audio-based digital testing of COVID-19. To investigate this, we collected a large crowdsourced respiratory audio dataset through a mobile app, alongside symptoms and COVID-19 test results. Within the collected dataset, we selected 5240 samples from 2478 English-speaking participants and split them into participant-independent sets for model development and validation. In addition to controlling the language, we also balanced demographics for model training to avoid potential acoustic bias. We used these audio samples to construct an audio-based COVID-19 prediction model. The unbiased model took features extracted from breathing, coughs and voice signals as predictors and yielded an AUC-ROC of 0.71 (95% CI: 0.65–0.77). We further explored several scenarios with different types of unbalanced data distributions to demonstrate how biases and participant splits affect the performance. With these different, but less appropriate, evaluation strategies, the performance could be overestimated, reaching an AUC up to 0.90 (95% CI: 0.85–0.95) in some circumstances. We found that an unrealistic experimental setting can result in misleading, sometimes over-optimistic, performance.

We gathered 98,038 fundus photographs from the Gyeongsang National University Changwon Hospital, South Korea, and augmented these with the Ocular Disease Intelligent Recognition dataset. We created eight combinations of image sets to train CNNs. Class activation mapping was used to identify the discriminative image regions used by the CNNs. CNNs identified right and left fundus images with high accuracy (more than 99.3% in the Gyeongsang National University Changwon Hospital dataset and 91.1% in the Ocular Disease Intelligent Recognition dataset) regardless of whether the images were flipped horizontally. The depth and complexity of the CNN affected the accuracy (DenseNet121: 99.91%, ResNet50: 99.86%, and VGG19: 99.37%). DenseNet121 did not discriminate images composed of only left eyes (55.1%, p = 0.548). Class activation mapping identified the macula as the discriminative region used by the CNNs. Several previous studies used the flipping method to augment data in fundus photographs. However, such photographs are distinct from non-flipped images. This asymmetry could result in undesired bias in machine learning. Therefore, when developing a CNN with fundus photographs, care should be taken when applying data augmentation with flipping.",Conclusions not available,DNN,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Predictive structured–unstructured interactions in EHR models: A case study of suicide prediction,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-022-00558-0,27 Jan 2022,"Clinical risk prediction models powered by electronic health records (EHRs) are becoming increasingly widespread in clinical practice. With suicide-related mortality rates rising in recent years, it is becoming increasingly urgent to understand, predict, and prevent suicidal behavior. Here, we compare the predictive value of structured and unstructured EHR data for predicting suicide risk. We find that Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC) and Random Forest (RF) models trained on structured EHR data perform better than those based on unstructured EHR data. An NBC model trained on both structured and unstructured data yields similar performance (AUC = 0.743) to an NBC model trained on structured data alone (0.742, p = 0.668), while an RF model trained on both data types yields significantly better results (AUC = 0.903) than an RF model trained on structured data alone (0.887, p < 0.001), likely due to the RF model’s ability to capture interactions between the two data types. To investigate these interactions, we propose and implement a general framework for identifying specific structured-unstructured feature pairs whose interactions differ between case and non-case cohorts, and thus have the potential to improve predictive performance and increase understanding of clinical risk. We find that such feature pairs tend to capture heterogeneous pairs of general concepts, rather than homogeneous pairs of specific concepts. These findings and this framework can be used to improve current and future EHR-based clinical modeling efforts.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Quality assessment standards in artificial intelligence diagnostic accuracy systematic reviews: a meta-research study,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-021-00544-y,27 Jan 2022,"Artificial intelligence (AI) centred diagnostic systems are increasingly recognised as robust solutions in healthcare delivery pathways. In turn, there has been a concurrent rise in secondary research studies regarding these technologies in order to influence key clinical and policymaking decisions. It is therefore essential that these studies accurately appraise methodological quality and risk of bias within shortlisted trials and reports. In order to assess whether this critical step is performed, we undertook a meta-research study evaluating adherence to the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2) tool within AI diagnostic accuracy systematic reviews. A literature search was conducted on all studies published from 2000 to December 2020. Of 50 included reviews, 36 performed the quality assessment, of which 27 utilised the QUADAS-2 tool. Bias was reported across all four domains of QUADAS-2. Two hundred forty-three of 423 studies (57.5%) across all systematic reviews utilising QUADAS-2 reported a high or unclear risk of bias in the patient selection domain, 110 (26%) reported a high or unclear risk of bias in the index test domain, 121 (28.6%) in the reference standard domain and 157 (37.1%) in the flow and timing domain. This study demonstrates the incomplete uptake of quality assessment tools in reviews of AI-based diagnostic accuracy studies and highlights inconsistent reporting across all domains of quality assessment. Poor standards of reporting act as barriers to clinical implementation. The creation of an AI-specific extension for quality assessment tools of diagnostic accuracy AI studies may facilitate the safe translation of AI tools into clinical practice.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Attention-guided deep learning for gestational age prediction using fetal brain MRI,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-05468-5,26 Jan 2022,"Magnetic resonance imaging offers unrivaled visualization of the fetal brain, forming the basis for establishing age-specific morphologic milestones. However, gauging age-appropriate neural development remains a difficult task due to the constantly changing appearance of the fetal brain, variable image quality, and frequent motion artifacts. Here we present an end-to-end, attention-guided deep learning model that predicts gestational age with R2 score of 0.945, mean absolute error of 6.7 days, and concordance correlation coefficient of 0.970. The convolutional neural network was trained on a heterogeneous dataset of 741 developmentally normal fetal brain images ranging from 19 to 39 weeks in gestational age. We also demonstrate model performance and generalizability using independent datasets from four academic institutions across the U.S. and Turkey with R2 scores of 0.81–0.90 after minimal fine-tuning. The proposed regression algorithm provides an automated machine-enabled tool with the potential to better characterize in utero neurodevelopment and guide real-time gestational age estimation after the first trimester.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Intranasal insulin modulates cerebrospinal fluid markers of neuroinflammation in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease: a randomized trial,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-05165-3,25 Jan 2022,"Intranasal insulin (INI) has shown promise as a treatment for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in pilot clinical trials. In a recent phase 2 trial, participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD who were treated with INI with one of two delivery devices showed improved cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) biomarker profiles and slower symptom progression compared with placebo. In the cohort which showed benefit, we measured changes in CSF markers of inflammation, immune function and vascular integrity and assessed their relationship with changes in cognition, brain volume, and CSF amyloid and tau concentrations. The insulin-treated group had increased CSF interferon-γ (p = 0.032) and eotaxin (p = 0.049), and reduced interleukin-6 (p = 0.048) over the 12 month trial compared to placebo. Trends were observed for increased CSF macrophage-derived chemokine for the placebo group (p = 0.083), and increased interleukin-2 in the insulin-treated group (p = 0.093). Insulin-treated and placebo groups showed strikingly different patterns of associations between changes in CSF immune/inflammatory/vascular markers and changes in cognition, brain volume, and amyloid and tau concentrations. In summary, INI treatment altered the typical progression of markers of inflammation and immune function seen in AD, suggesting that INI may promote a compensatory immune response associated with therapeutic benefit.",Conclusions not available,Gen AI,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Prediction and recommendation by machine learning through repetitive internal validation for hepatic veno-occlusive disease/sinusoidal obstruction syndrome and early death after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41409-022-01583-z,24 Jan 2022,"Using traditional statistical methods, we previously analyzed the risk factors and treatment outcomes of veno-occlusive disease/sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (VOD/SOS) after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. Within the same cohort, we applied machine learning to create prediction and recommendation models. We analyzed 2572 transplants using eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to predict post-transplant VOD/SOS and early death. Using the XGBoost and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), we found influential factors and devised recommendation models, which were internally verified by repetitive ten-fold cross-validation. SHAP values suggested that gender, busulfan dosage, age, forced expiratory volume, and Disease Risk Index were significant factors for VOD/SOS. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves and the areas under the precision-recall curve of the models were 0.740, 0.144 for all VOD/SOS, 0.793, 0.793 for severe to very severe VOD/SOS, and 0.746, 0.304 for early death. According to our single feature recommendation, following the busulfan dosage was the most effective for preventing VOD/SOS. The recommendation method for six adjustable feature sets was also validated, and a subgroup corresponding to five to six features showed significant preventive power for VOD/SOS and early death. Our personalized treatment set recommendation showed reproducibility in repetitive internal validation, but large external cohorts should prospectively validate our model.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
External validation of deep learning-based bone-age software: a preliminary study with real world data,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-05282-z,24 Jan 2022,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being used in bone-age (BA) assessment due to its complicated and lengthy nature. We aimed to evaluate the clinical performance of a commercially available deep learning (DL)–based software for BA assessment using a real-world data. From Nov. 2018 to Feb. 2019, 474 children (35 boys, 439 girls, age 4–17 years) were enrolled. We compared the BA estimated by DL software (DL-BA) with that independently estimated by 3 reviewers (R1: Musculoskeletal radiologist, R2: Radiology resident, R3: Pediatric endocrinologist) using the traditional Greulich–Pyle atlas, then to his/her chronological age (CA). A paired t-test, Pearson’s correlation coefficient, Bland–Altman plot, mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) were used for the statistical analysis. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used for inter-rater variation. There were significant differences between DL-BA and each reviewer’s BA (P < 0.025), but the correlation was good with one another (r = 0.983, P < 0.025). RMSE (MAE) values were 10.09 (7.21), 10.76 (7.88) and 13.06 (10.06) months between DL-BA and R1, R2, R3 BA. Compared with the CA, RMSE (MAE) values were 13.54 (11.06), 15.18 (12.11), 16.19 (12.78) and 19.53 (17.71) months for DL-BA, R1, R2, R3 BA, respectively. Bland–Altman plots revealed the software and reviewers’ tendency to overestimate the BA in general. ICC values between 3 reviewers were 0.97, 0.85 and 0.86, and the overall ICC value was 0.93.

We developed and tested a DL model using the long short-term memory method with a dataset of fluorescence values measured in each cycle of 5810 RT-PCR tests. Among the DL models developed here, the diagnostic performance of the 21st model showed an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC), sensitivity, and specificity of 84.55%, 93.33%, and 75.72%, respectively.

Application of ensemble machine learning algorithms on lifestyle factors and wearables for cardiovascular risk prediction,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-04649-y,20 Jan 2022,"This study looked at novel data sources for cardiovascular risk prediction including detailed lifestyle questionnaire and continuous blood pressure monitoring, using ensemble machine learning algorithms (MLAs). The reference conventional risk score compared against was the Framingham Risk Score (FRS). The outcome variables were low or high risk based on calcium score 0 or calcium score 100 and above. Ensemble MLAs were built based on naive bayes, random forest and support vector classifier for low risk and generalized linear regression, support vector regressor and stochastic gradient descent regressor for high risk categories. MLAs were trained on 600 Southeast Asians aged 21 to 69 years free of cardiovascular disease. All MLAs outperformed the FRS for low and high-risk categories. MLA based on lifestyle questionnaire only achieved AUC of 0.715 (95% CI 0.681, 0.750) and 0.710 (95% CI 0.653, 0.766) for low and high risk respectively. Combining all groups of risk factors (lifestyle survey questionnaires, clinical blood tests, 24-h ambulatory blood pressure and heart rate monitoring) along with feature selection, prediction of low and high CVD risk groups were further enhanced to 0.791 (95% CI 0.759, 0.822) and 0.790 (95% CI 0.745, 0.836).

An integrated framework for identifying clinical-laboratory indicators for novel pandemics: COVID-19 and MIS-C,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-021-00547-9,20 Jan 2022,"During the critical early stages of an emerging pandemic, limited availability of pathogen-specific testing can severely inhibit individualized risk screening and pandemic tracking. Standard clinical laboratory tests offer a widely available complementary data source for first-line risk screening and pandemic surveillance. Here, we propose an integrated framework for developing clinical-laboratory indicators for novel pandemics that combines population-level and individual-level analyses. We apply this framework to 7,520,834 clinical laboratory tests recorded over five years and find clinical-lab-test combinations that are strongly associated with SARS-CoV-2 PCR test results and Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) diagnoses: Interleukin-related tests (e.g. IL4, IL10) were most strongly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and MIS-C, while other more widely available tests (ferritin, D-dimer, fibrinogen, alanine transaminase, and C-reactive protein) also had strong associations. When novel pandemics emerge, this framework can be used to identify specific combinations of clinical laboratory tests for public health tracking and first-line individualized risk screening.",Conclusions not available,Gen AI,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Label-free imaging flow cytometry for analysis and sorting of enzymatically dissociated tissues,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-05007-2,19 Jan 2022,"Biomedical research relies on identification and isolation of specific cell types using molecular biomarkers and sorting methods such as fluorescence or magnetic activated cell sorting. Labelling processes potentially alter the cells’ properties and should be avoided, especially when purifying cells for clinical applications. A promising alternative is the label-free identification of cells based on physical properties. Sorting real-time deformability cytometry (soRT-DC) is a microfluidic technique for label-free analysis and sorting of single cells. In soRT-FDC, bright-field images of cells are analyzed by a deep neural net (DNN) to obtain a sorting decision, but sorting was so far only demonstrated for blood cells which show clear morphological differences and are naturally in suspension. Most cells, however, grow in tissues, requiring dissociation before cell sorting which is associated with challenges including changes in morphology, or presence of aggregates. Here, we introduce methods to improve robustness of analysis and sorting of single cells from nervous tissue and provide DNNs which can distinguish visually similar cells. We employ the DNN for image-based sorting to enrich photoreceptor cells from dissociated retina for transplantation into the mouse eye.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: ; Attacker Capability: 
Automated evaluation of retinal pigment epithelium disease area in eyes with age-related macular degeneration,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-05006-3,18 Jan 2022,"The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is essential for the survival and function of retinal photoreceptor cells. RPE dysfunction causes various retinal diseases including age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Clinical studies on ES/iPS cell-derived RPE transplantation for RPE dysfunction-triggered diseases are currently underway. Quantification of the diseased RPE area is important to evaluate disease progression or the therapeutic effect of RPE transplantation. However, there are no standard protocols. To address this issue, we developed a 2-step software that enables objective and efficient quantification of RPE-disease area changes by analyzing the early-phase hyperfluorescent area in fluorescein angiography (FA) images. We extracted the Abnormal region. This extraction was based on deep learning-based discrimination. We scored the binarized extracted area using an automated program. Our program’s performance for the same eye from the serial image captures was within 3.1 ± 7.8% error. In progressive AMD, the trend was consistent with human assessment, even when FA images from two different visits were compared. This method was applicable to quantifying RPE-disease area changes over time, evaluating iPSC-RPE transplantation images, and a disease other than AMD. Our program may contribute to the assessment of the clinical course of RPE-disease areas in routine clinics and reduce the workload of researchers.",Conclusions not available,DNN,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Objective evaluation of deep uncertainty predictions for COVID-19 detection,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-05052-x,17 Jan 2022,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely applied for detecting COVID-19 in medical images. Existing studies mainly apply transfer learning and other data representation strategies to generate accurate point estimates. The generalization power of these networks is always questionable due to being developed using small datasets and failing to report their predictive confidence. Quantifying uncertainties associated with DNN predictions is a prerequisite for their trusted deployment in medical settings. Here we apply and evaluate three uncertainty quantification techniques for COVID-19 detection using chest X-Ray (CXR) images. The novel concept of uncertainty confusion matrix is proposed and new performance metrics for the objective evaluation of uncertainty estimates are introduced. Through comprehensive experiments, it is shown that networks pertained on CXR images outperform networks pretrained on natural image datasets such as ImageNet. Qualitatively and quantitatively evaluations also reveal that the predictive uncertainty estimates are statistically higher for erroneous predictions than correct predictions. Accordingly, uncertainty quantification methods are capable of flagging risky predictions with high uncertainty estimates. We also observe that ensemble methods more reliably capture uncertainties during the inference. DNN-based solutions for COVID-19 detection have been mainly proposed without any principled mechanism for risk mitigation. Previous studies have mainly focused on on generating single-valued predictions using pretrained DNNs. In this paper, we comprehensively apply and comparatively evaluate three uncertainty quantification techniques for COVID-19 detection using chest X-Ray images. The novel concept of uncertainty confusion matrix is proposed and new performance metrics for the objective evaluation of uncertainty estimates are introduced for the first time. Using these new uncertainty performance metrics, we quantitatively demonstrate when we could trust DNN predictions for COVID-19 detection from chest X-rays. It is important to note the proposed novel uncertainty evaluation metrics are generic and could be applied for evaluation of probabilistic forecasts in all classification problems.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Reliable serological markers of recent malaria exposure could improve current surveillance methods by allowing for accurate estimates of infection incidence from limited data. We studied the IgG antibody response to 111 Plasmodium falciparum proteins in 65 adult travellers followed longitudinally after a natural malaria infection in complete absence of re-exposure. We identified a combination of five serological markers that detect exposure within the previous three months with >80% sensitivity and specificity. Using mathematical modelling, we examined the antibody kinetics and determined that responses informative of recent exposure display several distinct characteristics: rapid initial boosting and decay, less inter-individual variation in response kinetics, and minimal persistence over time.

Implementation is impeded by the ethical and practical problem of differentiating vaccine access based on a personal characteristic that is hard-to-measure and private. Here, we propose the use of occupational category as a proxy for connectedness in a contact network. Using survey data on occupation-specific contact frequencies, we calibrate a model of disease propagation in populations undergoing varying vaccination campaigns. We find that vaccination campaigns that prioritize high-contact occupational groups achieve similar infection levels with half the number of vaccines, while also reducing and delaying peaks. The paper thus identifies a concrete, operational strategy for dramatically improving vaccination efficiency in ongoing pandemics.",Conclusions not available,Gen AI,"Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient, healthcare practitioner; Attacker Capability: "

The framework proposed to deal with imbalanced datasets for classification-based approaches using electronic healthcare records (EHR). We have utilized supervised ML methods to predict lung cancer inpatients LOS during ICU hospitalization using the MIMIC-III dataset. Random Forest (RF) Model outperformed other models and achieved predicted results during the three framework phases. With clinical significance features selection, over-sampling methods (SMOTE and ADASYN) achieved the highest AUC results (98% with CI 95%: 95.3–100%, and 100% respectively).

Under-sampling methods reported the least important AUC results (50%, with CI 95%: 40.2–59.8%) for both (ENN and Tomek- Links). Using ML explainable technique called SHAP, we explained the outcome of the predictive model (RF) with SMOTE class balancing technique to understand the most significant clinical features that contributed to predicting lung cancer LOS with the RF model.

Machine learning algorithms as new screening approach for patients with endometriosis,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-04637-2,12 Jan 2022,"Endometriosis—a systemic and chronic condition occurring in women of childbearing age—is a highly enigmatic disease with unresolved questions. While multiple biomarkers, genomic analysis, questionnaires, and imaging techniques have been advocated as screening and triage tests for endometriosis to replace diagnostic laparoscopy, none have been implemented routinely in clinical practice. We investigated the use of machine learning algorithms (MLA) in the diagnosis and screening of endometriosis based on 16 key clinical and patient-based symptom features. The sensitivity, specificity, F1-score and AUCs of the MLA to diagnose endometriosis in the training and validation sets varied from 0.82 to 1, 0–0.8, 0–0.88, 0.5–0.89, and from 0.91 to 0.95, 0.66–0.92, 0.77–0.92, respectively. Our data suggest that MLA could be a promising screening test for general practitioners, gynecologists, and other front-line health care providers. Introducing MLA in this setting represents a paradigm change in clinical practice as it could replace diagnostic laparoscopy. Furthermore, this patient-based screening tool empowers patients with endometriosis to self-identify potential symptoms and initiate dialogue with physicians about diagnosis and treatment, and hence contribute to shared decision making.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
DeepNull models non-linear covariate effects to improve phenotypic prediction and association power,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-27930-0,11 Jan 2022,"Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) examine the association between genotype and phenotype while adjusting for a set of covariates. Although the covariates may have non-linear or interactive effects, due to the challenge of specifying the model, GWAS often neglect such terms. Here we introduce DeepNull, a method that identifies and adjusts for non-linear and interactive covariate effects using a deep neural network. In analyses of simulated and real data, we demonstrate that DeepNull maintains tight control of the type I error while increasing statistical power by up to 20% in the presence of non-linear and interactive effects. Moreover, in the absence of such effects, DeepNull incurs no loss of power. When applied to 10 phenotypes from the UK Biobank (n = 370K), DeepNull discovered more hits (+6%) and loci (+7%), on average, than conventional association analyses, many of which are biologically plausible or have previously been reported. Finally, DeepNull improves upon linear modeling for phenotypic prediction (+23% on average).",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: ; Attacker Capability: 
Cuffless blood pressure monitoring from a wristband with calibration-free algorithms for sensing location based on bio-impedance sensor array and autoencoder,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-03612-1,10 Jan 2022,"Continuous monitoring of blood pressure (BP) is essential for the prediction and the prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Cuffless BP methods based on non-invasive sensors integrated into wearable devices can translate blood pulsatile activity into continuous BP data. However, local blood pulsatile sensors from wearable devices suffer from inaccurate pulsatile activity measurement based on superficial capillaries, large form-factor devices and BP variation with sensor location which degrade the accuracy of BP estimation and the device wearability. This study presents a cuffless BP monitoring method based on a novel bio-impedance (Bio-Z) sensor array built in a flexible wristband with small-form factor that provides a robust blood pulsatile sensing and BP estimation without calibration methods for the sensing location. We use a convolutional neural network (CNN) autoencoder that reconstructs an accurate estimate of the arterial pulse signal independent of sensing location from a group of six Bio-Z sensors within the sensor array. We rely on an Adaptive Boosting regression model which maps the features of the estimated arterial pulse signal to systolic and diastolic BP readings. BP was accurately estimated with average error and correlation coefficient of 0.5 ± 5.0 mmHg and 0.80 for diastolic BP, and 0.2 ± 6.5 mmHg and 0.79 for systolic BP, respectively.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

The BRadykinesia Akinesia INcoordination (BRAIN) test is a validated keyboard tapping test, evaluating proximal upper-limb motor impairment. Here, a new Distal Finger Tapping (DFT) test was developed to assess distal upper-limb function. Kinetic parameters of the test include kinesia score (KS20, key taps over 20 s), akinesia time (AT20, mean dwell-time on each key) and incoordination score (IS20, variance of travelling time between key taps). To develop and evaluate a new keyboard-tapping test for objective and remote distal motor function in PD patients. The DFT and BRAIN tests were assessed in 55 PD patients and 65 controls. Test scores were compared between groups and correlated with the MDS-UPDRS-III finger tapping sub-scores. Nine additional PD patients were recruited for monitoring motor fluctuations. All three parameters discriminated effectively between PD patients and controls, with KS20 performing best, yielding 79% sensitivity for 85% specificity; area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.90. A combination of DFT and BRAIN tests improved discrimination (AUC = 0.95). Among three parameters, KS20 showed a moderate correlation with the MDS-UPDRS finger-tapping sub-score (Pearson’s r = − 0.40, p = 0.002). Further, the DFT test detected subtle changes in motor fluctuation states which were not reflected clearly by the MDS-UPDRS-III finger tapping sub-scores.

Region-specific complexity of the intracranial EEG in the sleeping human brain,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-04213-8,10 Jan 2022,"As the brain is a complex system with occurrence of self-similarity at different levels, a dedicated analysis of the complexity of brain signals is of interest to elucidate the functional role of various brain regions across the various stages of vigilance. We exploited intracranial electroencephalogram data from 38 cortical regions using the Higuchi fractal dimension (HFD) as measure to assess brain complexity, on a dataset of 1772 electrode locations. HFD values depended on sleep stage and topography. HFD increased with higher levels of vigilance, being highest during wakefulness in the frontal lobe. HFD did not change from wake to stage N2 in temporo-occipital regions. The transverse temporal gyrus was the only area in which the HFD did not differ between any two vigilance stages. Interestingly, HFD of wakefulness and stage R were different mainly in the precentral gyrus, possibly reflecting motor inhibition in stage R. The fusiform and parahippocampal gyri were the only areas showing no difference between wakefulness and N2. Stages R and N2 were similar only for the postcentral gyrus. Topographical analysis of brain complexity revealed that sleep stages are clearly differentiated in fronto-central brain regions, but that temporo-occipital regions sleep differently.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Intravital microscopic observation of the microvasculature during hemodialysis in healthy rats,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-03681-2,07 Jan 2022,"Hemodialysis (HD) provides life-saving treatment for kidney failure. Patient mortality is extremely high, with cardiovascular disease (CVD) being the leading cause of death. This results from both a high underlying burden of cardiovascular disease, as well as additional physiological stress from the HD procedure itself. Clinical observations indicate that HD is associated with microvascular dysfunction (MD), underlining the need for a fundamental pathophysiological assessment of the microcirculatory consequences of HD. We therefore successfully developed an experimental small animal model, that allows for a simultaneous real-time assessment of the microvasculature. Using in-house built ultra-low surface area dialyzers and miniaturized extracorporeal circuit, we successfully dialyzed male Wistar Kyoto rats and combined this with a simultaneous intravital microscopic observation of the EDL microvasculature. Our results show that even in healthy animals, a euvolemic HD procedure can induce a significant systemic hemodynamic disturbance and induce disruption of microvascular perfusion (as evidence by a reduction in the proportion of the observed microcirculation receiving blood flow). This study, using a new small animal hemodialysis model, has allowed direct demonstration that microvascular blood flow in tissue in skeletal muscle is acutely reduced during HD, potentially in concert with other microvascular beds. It shows that preclinical small animal models can be used to further investigate HD-induced ischemic organ injury and allow rapid throughput of putative interventions directed at reducing HD-induced multi-organ ischemic injury.",Conclusions not available,Gen AI,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Light sheet based volume flow cytometry (VFC) for rapid volume reconstruction and parameter estimation on the go,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-03902-8,07 Jan 2022,"Optical imaging is paramount for disease diagnosis and to access its progression over time. The proposed optical flow imaging (VFC/iLIFE) is a powerful technique that adds new capabilities (3D volume visualization, organelle-level resolution, and multi-organelle screening) to the existing system. Unlike state-of-the-art point-illumination-based biomedical imaging techniques, the sheet-based VFC technique is capable of single-shot sectional visualization, high throughput interrogation, real-time parameter estimation, and instant volume reconstruction with organelle-level resolution of live specimens. The specimen flow system was realized on a multichannel (Y-type) microfluidic chip that enables visualization of organelle distribution in several cells in-parallel at a relatively high flow-rate (2000 nl/min). The calibration of VFC system requires the study of point emitters (fluorescent beads) at physiologically relevant flow-rates (500–2000 nl/min) for determining flow-induced optical aberration in the system point spread function (PSF). Subsequently, the recorded raw images and volumes were computationally deconvolved with flow-variant PSF to reconstruct the cell volume. High throughput investigation of the mitochondrial network in HeLa cancer cell was carried out at sub-cellular resolution in real-time and critical parameters (mitochondria count and size distribution, morphology, entropy, and cell strain statistics) were determined on-the-go. These parameters determine the physiological state of cells, and the changes over-time, revealing the metastatic progression of diseases. Overall, the developed VFC system enables real-time monitoring of sub-cellular organelle organization at a high-throughput with high-content capacity.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: ; Attacker Capability: 
Diagnostic assessment of glaucoma and non-glaucomatous optic neuropathies via optical texture analysis of the retinal nerve fibre layer,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-021-00813-x,06 Jan 2022,"The clinical diagnostic evaluation of optic neuropathies relies on the analysis of the thickness of the retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) by optical coherence tomography (OCT). However, false positives and false negatives in the detection of RNFL abnormalities are common. Here we show that an algorithm integrating measurements of RNFL thickness and reflectance from standard wide-field OCT scans can be used to uncover the trajectories and optical texture of individual axonal fibre bundles in the retina and to discern distinctive patterns of loss of axonal fibre bundles in glaucoma, compressive optic neuropathy, optic neuritis and non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy. Such optical texture analysis can detect focal RNFL defects in early optic neuropathy, as well as residual axonal fibre bundles in end-stage optic neuropathy that were indiscernible by conventional OCT analysis and by red-free RNFL photography. In a diagnostic-performance study, optical texture analysis of the RNFL outperformed conventional OCT in the detection of glaucoma, as defined by visual-field testing or red-free photography. Our findings show that optical texture analysis of the RNFL for the detection of optic neuropathies is highly sensitive and specific.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Improving local prevalence estimates of SARS-CoV-2 infections using a causal debiasing framework,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-021-01029-0,31 Dec 2021,"Global and national surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology is mostly based on targeted schemes focused on testing individuals with symptoms. These tested groups are often unrepresentative of the wider population and exhibit test positivity rates that are biased upwards compared with the true population prevalence. Such data are routinely used to infer infection prevalence and the effective reproduction number, Rt, which affects public health policy. Here, we describe a causal framework that provides debiased fine-scale spatiotemporal estimates by combining targeted test counts with data from a randomized surveillance study in the United Kingdom called REACT. Our probabilistic model includes a bias parameter that captures the increased probability of an infected individual being tested, relative to a non-infected individual, and transforms observed test counts to debiased estimates of the true underlying local prevalence and Rt. We validated our approach on held-out REACT data over a 7-month period. Furthermore, our local estimates of Rt are indicative of 1-week- and 2-week-ahead changes in SARS-CoV-2-positive case numbers. We also observed increases in estimated local prevalence and Rt that reflect the spread of the Alpha and Delta variants. Our results illustrate how randomized surveys can augment targeted testing to improve statistical accuracy in monitoring the spread of emerging and ongoing infectious disease.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
A generative adversarial approach to facilitate archival-quality histopathologic diagnoses from frozen tissue sections,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41374-021-00718-y,28 Dec 2021,"In clinical diagnostics and research involving histopathology, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue is almost universally favored for its superb image quality. However, tissue processing time (>24 h) can slow decision-making. In contrast, fresh frozen (FF) processing (<1 h) can yield rapid information but diagnostic accuracy is suboptimal due to lack of clearing, morphologic deformation and more frequent artifacts. Here, we bridge this gap using artificial intelligence. We synthesize FFPE-like images (“virtual FFPE”) from FF images using a generative adversarial network (GAN) from 98 paired kidney samples derived from 40 patients. Five board-certified pathologists evaluated the results in a blinded test. Image quality of the virtual FFPE data was assessed to be high and showed a close resemblance to real FFPE images. Clinical assessments of disease on the virtual FFPE images showed a higher inter-observer agreement compared to FF images. The nearly instantaneously generated virtual FFPE images can not only reduce time to information but can facilitate more precise diagnosis from routine FF images without extraneous costs and effort.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

We conducted a randomized trial with adults with prediabetes who were given either a waist-worn or wrist-worn wearable to track activity patterns. We collected baseline information on demographics, medical history, and laboratory testing. We tested three models that predicted changes in hemoglobin A1c that were continuous, improved glycemic control by 5% or worsened glycemic control by 5%. Consistently in all three models, prediction improved when (a) machine learning was used vs. traditional regression, with ensemble methods performing the best; (b) baseline information with wearable data was used vs. baseline information alone; and (c) wrist-worn wearables were used vs. waist-worn wearables. These findings indicate that models can accurately identify changes in glycemic control among prediabetic adults, and this could be used to better allocate resources and target interventions to prevent progression to diabetes.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Predicting surgical outcomes for chronic exertional compartment syndrome using a machine learning framework with embedded trust by interrogation strategies,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-03825-4,20 Dec 2021,"Chronic exertional compartment syndrome (CECS) is a condition occurring most frequently in the lower limbs and often requires corrective surgery to alleviate symptoms. Amongst military personnel, the success rates of this surgery can be as low as 20%, presenting a challenge in determining whether surgery is worthwhile. In this study, the data of 132 fasciotomies for CECS was analysed and using combinatorial feature selection methods, coupled with input from clinicians, identified a set of key clinical features contributing to the occupational outcomes of surgery. Features were utilised to develop a machine learning model for predicting return-to-work outcomes 12-months post-surgery. An AUC of 0.85 ± 0.08 was achieved using a linear-SVM, trained using 6 features (height, mean arterial pressure, pre-surgical score on the exercise-induced leg pain questionnaire, time from initial presentation to surgery, and whether a patient had received a prior surgery for CECS). To facilitate trust and transparency, interrogation strategies were used to identify reasons why certain patients were misclassified, using instance hardness measures. Model interrogation revealed that patient difficulty was associated with an overlap in the clinical characteristics of surgical outcomes, which was best handled by XGBoost and SVM-based models. The methodology was compiled into a machine learning framework, termed AITIA, which can be applied to other clinical problems. AITIA extends the typical machine learning pipeline, integrating the proposed interrogation strategy, allowing to user to reason and decide whether to trust the developed model based on the sensibility of its decision-making.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Comparisons of deep learning algorithms for diagnosing bacterial keratitis via external eye photographs,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-03572-6,20 Dec 2021,"Bacterial keratitis (BK), a painful and fulminant bacterial infection of the cornea, is the most common type of vision-threatening infectious keratitis (IK). A rapid clinical diagnosis by an ophthalmologist may often help prevent BK patients from progression to corneal melting or even perforation, but many rural areas cannot afford an ophthalmologist. Thanks to the rapid development of deep learning (DL) algorithms, artificial intelligence via image could provide an immediate screening and recommendation for patients with red and painful eyes. Therefore, this study aims to elucidate the potentials of different DL algorithms for diagnosing BK via external eye photos. External eye photos of clinically suspected IK were consecutively collected from five referral centers. The candidate DL frameworks, including ResNet50, ResNeXt50, DenseNet121, SE-ResNet50, EfficientNets B0, B1, B2, and B3, were trained to recognize BK from the photo toward the target with the greatest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Via five-cross validation, EfficientNet B3 showed the most excellent average AUROC, in which the average percentage of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value was 74, 64, 77, and 61. There was no statistical difference in diagnostic accuracy and AUROC between any two of these DL frameworks. The diagnostic accuracy of these models (ranged from 69 to 72%) is comparable to that of the ophthalmologist (66% to 74%). Therefore, all these models are promising tools for diagnosing BK in first-line medical care units without ophthalmologists.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Clinical response to nivolumab in an INI1-deficient pediatric chordoma correlates with immunogenic recognition of brachyury,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41698-021-00238-4,20 Dec 2021,"Poorly differentiated chordoma (PDC) is a recently recognized subtype of chordoma characterized by expression of the embryonic transcription factor, brachyury, and loss of INI1. PDC primarily affects children and is associated with a poor prognosis and limited treatment options. Here we describe the molecular and immune tumour microenvironment profiles of two paediatric PDCs produced using whole-genome, transcriptome and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) and multiplex immunohistochemistry. Our analyses revealed the presence of tumour-associated immune cells, including CD8+ T cells, and expression of the immune checkpoint protein, PD-L1, in both patient samples. Molecular profiling provided the rationale for immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy, which resulted in a clinical and radiographic response. A dominant T cell receptor (TCR) clone specific for a brachyury peptide–MHC complex was identified from bulk RNA sequencing, suggesting that targeting of the brachyury tumour antigen by tumour-associated T cells may underlie this clinical response to ICI. Correlative analysis with rhabdoid tumours, another INI1-deficient paediatric malignancy, suggests that a subset of tumours may share common immune phenotypes, indicating the potential for a therapeutically targetable subgroup of challenging paediatric cancers.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: evasion; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
"Customizing skills for assistive robotic manipulators, an inverse reinforcement learning approach with error-related potentials",https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-021-02891-8,16 Dec 2021,"Robotic assistance via motorized robotic arm manipulators can be of valuable assistance to individuals with upper-limb motor disabilities. Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) offer an intuitive means to control such assistive robotic manipulators. However, BCI performance may vary due to the non-stationary nature of the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. It, hence, cannot be used safely for controlling tasks where errors may be detrimental to the user. Avoiding obstacles is one such task. As there exist many techniques to avoid obstacles in robotics, we propose to give the control to the robot to avoid obstacles and to leave to the user the choice of the robot behavior to do so a matter of personal preference as some users may be more daring while others more careful. We enable the users to train the robot controller to adapt its way to approach obstacles relying on BCI that detects error-related potentials (ErrP), indicative of the user’s error expectation of the robot’s current strategy to meet their preferences. Gaussian process-based inverse reinforcement learning, in combination with the ErrP-BCI, infers the user’s preference and updates the obstacle avoidance controller so as to generate personalized robot trajectories. We validate the approach in experiments with thirteen able-bodied subjects using a robotic arm that picks up, places and avoids real-life objects. Results show that the algorithm can learn user’s preference and adapt the robot behavior rapidly using less than five demonstrations not necessarily optimal.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Development and validation of a practical machine-learning triage algorithm for the detection of patients in need of critical care in the emergency department,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-03104-2,15 Dec 2021,"Identifying critically ill patients is a key challenge in emergency department (ED) triage. Mis-triage errors are still widespread in triage systems around the world. Here, we present a machine learning system (MLS) to assist ED triage officers better recognize critically ill patients and provide a text-based explanation of the MLS recommendation. To derive the MLS, an existing dataset of 22,272 patient encounters from 2012 to 2019 from our institution’s electronic emergency triage system (EETS) was used for algorithm training and validation. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.875 ± 0.006 (CI:95%) in retrospective dataset using fivefold cross validation, higher than that of reference model (0.843 ± 0.005 (CI:95%)). In the prospective cohort study, compared to the traditional triage system’s 1.2% mis-triage rate, the mis-triage rate in the MLS-assisted group was 0.9%. This MLS method with a real-time explanation for triage officers was able to lower the mis-triage rate of critically ill ED patients.","It is challenging to accurately differentiate critically ill from stable patients in the ED, which can lead to life-threatening cases of mis-triage. This study’s MLS was able to reduce the life-threatening mis-triage rate from 1.2 to 0.9% in the prospective arm. Compared to previous studies, our MLS approach also provided a detailed explanation of each patient’s risk of mis-triage, and caused nearly 25% more triage calls to supervising ED physicians. Although MLS protocols can lower mis-triage rates, future prospective studies may shed more light on potential reductions in patient morbidity and mortality.","Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Prediction across healthcare settings: a case study in predicting emergency department disposition,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-021-00537-x,15 Dec 2021,"Several approaches exist today for developing predictive models across multiple clinical sites, yet there is a lack of comparative data on their performance, especially within the context of EHR-based prediction models. We set out to provide a framework for prediction across healthcare settings. As a case study, we examined an ED disposition prediction model across three geographically and demographically diverse sites. We conducted a 1-year retrospective study, including all visits in which the outcome was either discharge-to-home or hospitalization. Four modeling approaches were compared: a ready-made model trained at one site and validated at other sites, a centralized uniform model incorporating data from all sites, multiple site-specific models, and a hybrid approach of a ready-made model re-calibrated using site-specific data. Predictions were performed using XGBoost. The study included 288,962 visits with an overall admission rate of 16.8% (7.9–26.9%). Some risk factors for admission were prominent across all sites (e.g., high-acuity triage emergency severity index score, high prior admissions rate), while others were prominent at only some sites (multiple lab tests ordered at the pediatric sites, early use of ECG at the adult site). The XGBoost model achieved its best performance using the uniform and site-specific approaches (AUC = 0.9–0.93), followed by the calibrated-model approach (AUC = 0.87–0.92), and the ready-made approach (AUC = 0.62–0.85).

This study performed a preliminary feasibility assessment of CDM-based vigilance. A cross-sectional study of target medical device data in EHR and CDM was conducted. A total of 155 medical devices were finally enrolled, with 58.7% of them having EDI codes. Femoral head prosthesis was selected as a focus group. It was registered in our institute with 11 EDI codes. However, only three EDI codes were converted to systematized nomenclature of medicine clinical terms concept. EDI code was matched in one-to-many (up to 104) with unique device identifier (UDI), including devices classified as different global medical device nomenclature. The use of UDI rather than EDI code as a medical device data source is recommended. We hope that this study will share the current state of medical device data recorded in the EHR and contribute to the introduction of CDM-based medical device vigilance by selecting appropriate medical device data sources.",Conclusions not available,Gen AI,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
The illusion of having a large virtual body biases action-specific perception in patients with mild cognitive impairment,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-03571-7,15 Dec 2021,"The illusion of having a large body makes us perceive objects as smaller than they really are. This action-specific perception effect occurs because we perceive the property of an object (i.e., size) differently according to our unique action capability (i.e., the affordance of body size). Although the body-ownership illusion contributing to this action-specific perception has been studied, its effects remain unclear in neurological patients. We examined the action-specific perception impairments of MCI patients by means of body-ownership illusion in a non-immersive virtual reality environment. Twenty healthy young adults, 21 healthy older adults, and 15 MCI patients were recruited. We assessed their “original-body action-specific perception” and “enlarged-body action-specific perception” using the original and enlarged sizes of their virtual bodies, respectively. The MCI patients’ original-body action-specific perception was no different than that of the healthy controls (p = 0.679). However, the enlarged-body action-specific perception of the MCI patients was significantly biased (p < 0.001). The inclusion of the enlarged-body action-specific perception provides additional discriminative power for early diagnosis of MCI (89.3% accuracy, 75.0% sensitivity, 100.0% specificity, and 87.5% balanced accuracy).",Conclusions not available,Gen AI,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Fusion of multi-scale bag of deep visual words features of chest X-ray images to detect COVID-19 infection,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-03287-8,13 Dec 2021,"Chest X-ray (CXR) images have been one of the important diagnosis tools used in the COVID-19 disease diagnosis. Deep learning (DL)-based methods have been used heavily to analyze these images. Compared to other DL-based methods, the bag of deep visual words-based method (BoDVW) proposed recently is shown to be a prominent representation of CXR images for their better discriminability. However, single-scale BoDVW features are insufficient to capture the detailed semantic information of the infected regions in the lungs as the resolution of such images varies in real application. In this paper, we propose a new multi-scale bag of deep visual words (MBoDVW) features, which exploits three different scales of the 4th pooling layer’s output feature map achieved from VGG-16 model. For MBoDVW-based features, we perform the Convolution with Max pooling operation over the 4th pooling layer using three different kernels: \(1 \times 1\), \(2 \times 2\), and \(3 \times 3\). We evaluate our proposed features with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification algorithm on four CXR public datasets (CD1, CD2, CD3, and CD4) with over 5000 CXR images.

The baseline data, LODS score, OASIS score, SAPS II score, and in-hospital prognosis of intensive care patients with STEMI were retrieved from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database. Propensity score matching analysis was performed to reduce bias. Receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) were drawn for the three scoring systems, and comparisons between the areas under the ROC curves (AUC) were conducted. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was performed to determine the net benefits of the three scoring systems. LODS and SAPS II were independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality. For the study cohort, the AUCs of LODS, OASIS, SAPS II were 0.867, 0.827, and 0.894; after PSM, the AUCs of LODS, OASIS, SAPS II were 0.877, 0.821, and 0.881.

The objective of our study was to determine whether novel artificially intelligent (AI) coaching interventions increase PA among overweight or obese, physically inactive cancer survivors compared to a control arm that receives health information. We conducted a single-center, three-arm randomized trial with equal allocation to (1) voice-assisted AI coaching delivered by smart speaker (MyCoach), (2) autonomous AI coaching delivered by text message (SmartText), and (3) control. Data collection was automated via sensors and voice technology, effectively masking outcome ascertainment. The primary outcome was change in mean steps per day from baseline to the end of follow-up at 4 weeks. Of the 42 randomized participants, 91% were female, and 36% were Black; mean age was 62.1 years, and mean BMI was 32.9 kg/m2. The majority were breast cancer survivors (85.7%). At the end of 4 weeks follow-up, steps increased in the MyCoach arm by an average of 3618.2 steps/day; the net gain in this arm was significantly greater [net difference = 3568.9 steps/day (95% CI: 1483–5655), P value <0.001] compared to control arm, and [net difference = 2160.6 steps/day (95% CI: 11–4310), P value 0.049] compared to SmartText. In conclusion, AI-based voice-assisted coaching shows promise as a practical method of delivering scalable, individualized coaching to increase physical activity in sedentary cancer survivors. Additional research is needed to replicate these findings in a broader population of cancer survivors and to investigate the effects of these interventions in the general population.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

A total of 149 patients (n = 30 with no heart disease, n = 30 with LVH, n = 61 with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and n = 28 with cardiac amyloidosis) undergoing a CMR scan were included in this study. We extracted a total of 850 radiomic features and explored their value in disease classification. We applied principal component analysis and unsupervised clustering in exploratory analysis, and then machine learning for feature selection of the best radiomic features that maximized the diagnostic value for cardiac disease classification. The first three principal components of the T1 radiomics were distinctively correlated with cardiac disease type. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the population by myocardial T1 radiomics was significantly associated with myocardial disease type (chi2 = 55.98, p < 0.0001). After feature selection, internal validation and external testing, a model of T1 radiomics had good diagnostic performance (AUC 0.753) for multinomial classification of disease phenotype (normal vs. LVH vs. HCM vs. cardiac amyloid). A subset of six radiomic features outperformed mean native T1 values for classification between myocardial health vs. disease and HCM phenocopies (AUC of T1 vs. radiomics model, for normal: 0.549 vs. 0.888; for LVH: 0.645 vs. 0.790; for HCM 0.541 vs. 0.638; and for cardiac amyloid 0.769 vs. 0.840). We show that myocardial texture assessed by native T1 maps is linked to features of cardiac disease. Myocardial radiomic phenotyping could enhance the diagnostic yield of T1 mapping for myocardial disease detection and classification.","In conclusion, we have presented a novel approach for myocardial texture phenotyping using T1 radiomics analysis. We demonstrated and validated by a machine learning approach that radiomic features provide added diagnostic value for distinction between healthy and diseased myocardium, as well as for differentiation between HCM and relevant phenocopies, such as amyloidosis, on top of native T1. The application of radiomics to standard native T1 mapping is a promising approach for the texture characterization of the human myocardium and for further enhancing the diagnostic value of CMR.","Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Predicting anesthetic infusion events using machine learning,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-03112-2,08 Dec 2021,"Recently, research has been conducted to automatically control anesthesia using machine learning, with the aim of alleviating the shortage of anesthesiologists. In this study, we address the problem of predicting decisions made by anesthesiologists during surgery using machine learning; specifically, we formulate a decision making problem by increasing the flow rate at each time point in the continuous administration of analgesic remifentanil as a supervised binary classification problem. The experiments were conducted to evaluate the prediction performance using six machine learning models: logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest, LightGBM, artificial neural network, and long short-term memory (LSTM), using 210 case data collected during actual surgeries. The results demonstrated that when predicting the future increase in flow rate of remifentanil after 1 min, the model using LSTM was able to predict with scores of 0.659 for sensitivity, 0.732 for specificity, and 0.753 for ROC-AUC; this demonstrates the potential to predict the decisions made by anesthesiologists using machine learning. Furthermore, we examined the importance and contribution of the features of each model using Shapley additive explanations—a method for interpreting predictions made by machine learning models. The trends indicated by the results were partially consistent with known clinical findings.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Intraoperative discrimination of native meningioma and dura mater by Raman spectroscopy,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-02977-7,08 Dec 2021,"Meningiomas are among the most frequent tumors of the central nervous system. For a total resection, shown to decrease recurrences, it is paramount to reliably discriminate tumor tissue from normal dura mater intraoperatively. Raman spectroscopy (RS) is a non-destructive, label-free method for vibrational analysis of biochemical molecules. On the microscopic level, RS was already used to differentiate meningioma from dura mater. In this study we test its suitability for intraoperative macroscopic meningioma diagnostics. RS is applied to surgical specimen of intracranial meningiomas. The main purpose is the differentiation of tumor from normal dura mater, in order to potentially accelerate the diagnostic workflow. The collected meningioma and dura mater samples (n = 223 tissue samples from a total of 59 patients) are analyzed under untreated conditions using a new partially robotized RS acquisition system. Spectra (n = 1273) are combined with the according histopathological analysis for each sample. Based on this, a classifier is trained via machine learning. Our trained classifier separates meningioma and dura mater with a sensitivity of 96.06 \(\pm \) 0.03% and a specificity of 95.44 \(\pm \) 0.02% for internal fivefold cross validation and 100% and 93.97% if validated with an external test set. RS is an efficient method to discriminate meningioma from healthy dura mater in fresh tissue samples without additional processing or histopathological imaging. It is a quick and reliable complementary diagnostic tool to the neuropathological workflow and has potential for guided surgery. RS offers a safe way to examine unfixed surgical specimens in a perioperative setting.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Multi-omic machine learning predictor of breast cancer therapy response,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04278-5,07 Dec 2021,"Breast cancers are complex ecosystems of malignant cells and the tumour microenvironment1. The composition of these tumour ecosystems and interactions within them contribute to responses to cytotoxic therapy2. Efforts to build response predictors have not incorporated this knowledge. We collected clinical, digital pathology, genomic and transcriptomic profiles of pre-treatment biopsies of breast tumours from 168 patients treated with chemotherapy with or without HER2 (encoded by ERBB2)-targeted therapy before surgery. Pathology end points (complete response or residual disease) at surgery3 were then correlated with multi-omic features in these diagnostic biopsies. Here we show that response to treatment is modulated by the pre-treated tumour ecosystem, and its multi-omics landscape can be integrated in predictive models using machine learning. The degree of residual disease following therapy is monotonically associated with pre-therapy features, including tumour mutational and copy number landscapes, tumour proliferation, immune infiltration and T cell dysfunction and exclusion. Combining these features into a multi-omic machine learning model predicted a pathological complete response in an external validation cohort (75 patients) with an area under the curve of 0.87. In conclusion, response to therapy is determined by the baseline characteristics of the totality of the tumour ecosystem captured through data integration and machine learning. This approach could be used to develop predictors for other cancers.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: evasion; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Quantum deep reinforcement learning for clinical decision support in oncology: application to adaptive radiotherapy,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-02910-y,07 Dec 2021,"Subtle differences in a patient’s genetics and physiology may alter radiotherapy (RT) treatment responses, motivating the need for a more personalized treatment plan. Accordingly, we have developed a novel quantum deep reinforcement learning (qDRL) framework for clinical decision support that can estimate an individual patient’s dose response mid-treatment and recommend an optimal dose adjustment. Our framework considers patients’ specific information including biological, physical, genetic, clinical, and dosimetric factors. Recognizing that physicians must make decisions amidst uncertainty in RT treatment outcomes, we employed indeterministic quantum states to represent human decision making in a real-life scenario. We paired quantum decision states with a model-based deep q-learning algorithm to optimize the clinical decision-making process in RT. We trained our proposed qDRL framework on an institutional dataset of 67 stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated on prospective adaptive protocols and independently validated our framework in an external multi-institutional dataset of 174 NSCLC patients. For a comprehensive evaluation, we compared three frameworks: DRL, qDRL trained in a Qiskit quantum computing simulator, and qDRL trained in an IBM quantum computer. Two metrics were considered to evaluate our framework: (1) similarity score, defined as the root mean square error between retrospective clinical decisions and the AI recommendations, and (2) self-evaluation scheme that compares retrospective clinical decisions and AI recommendations based on the improvement in the observed clinical outcomes. Our analysis shows that our framework, which takes into consideration individual patient dose response in its decision-making, can potentially improve clinical RT decision-making by at least about 10% compared to unaided clinical practice. Further validation of our novel quantitative approach in a prospective study will provide a necessary framework for improving the standard of care in personalized RT.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Personalized modulation of coagulation factors using a thrombin dynamics model to treat trauma-induced coagulopathy,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41540-021-00202-9,07 Dec 2021,"Current trauma-induced coagulopathy resuscitation protocols use slow laboratory measurements, rules-of-thumb, and clinician gestalt to administer large volumes of uncharacterized, non-tailored blood products. These one-size-fits-all treatment approaches have high mortality. Here, we provide significant evidence that trauma patient survival 24 h after hospital admission occurs if and only if blood protein coagulation factor concentrations equilibrate at a normal value, either from inadvertent plasma-based modulation or from innate compensation. This result motivates quantitatively guiding trauma patient coagulation factor levels while accounting for protein interactions. Toward such treatment, we develop a Goal-oriented Coagulation Management (GCM) algorithm, a personalized and automated ordered sequence of operations to compute and specify coagulation factor concentrations that rectify clotting. This novel GCM algorithm also integrates new control-oriented advancements that we make in this work: an improvement of a prior thrombin dynamics model that captures the coagulation process to control, a use of rapidly-measurable concentrations to help predict patient state, and an accounting of patient-specific effects and limitations when adding coagulation factors to remedy coagulopathy. Validation of the GCM algorithm’s guidance shows superior performance over clinical practice in attaining normal coagulation factor concentrations and normal clotting profiles simultaneously.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Rib fracture detection system based on deep learning,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-03002-7,06 Dec 2021,"Rib fracture detection is time-consuming and demanding work for radiologists. This study aimed to introduce a novel rib fracture detection system based on deep learning which can help radiologists to diagnose rib fractures in chest computer tomography (CT) images conveniently and accurately. A total of 1707 patients were included in this study from a single center. We developed a novel rib fracture detection system on chest CT using a three-step algorithm. According to the examination time, 1507, 100 and 100 patients were allocated to the training set, the validation set and the testing set, respectively. Free Response ROC analysis was performed to evaluate the sensitivity and false positivity of the deep learning algorithm. Precision, recall, F1-score, negative predictive value (NPV) and detection and diagnosis were selected as evaluation metrics to compare the diagnostic efficiency of this system with radiologists. The radiologist-only study was used as a benchmark and the radiologist-model collaboration study was evaluated to assess the model’s clinical applicability. A total of 50,170,399 blocks (fracture blocks, 91,574; normal blocks, 50,078,825) were labelled for training. The F1-score of the Rib Fracture Detection System was 0.890 and the precision, recall and NPV values were 0.869, 0.913 and 0.969, respectively. By interacting with this detection system, the F1-score of the junior and the experienced radiologists had improved from 0.796 to 0.925 and 0.889 to 0.970, respectively; the recall scores had increased from 0.693 to 0.920 and 0.853 to 0.972, respectively. On average, the diagnosis time of radiologist assisted with this detection system was reduced by 65.3 s. The constructed Rib Fracture Detection System has a comparable performance with the experienced radiologist and is readily available to automatically detect rib fracture in the clinical setting with high efficacy, which could reduce diagnosis time and radiologists’ workload in the clinical practice.","This study developed a Rib Fracture Detection System that achieved high performance in rib fracture detection on chest CT images based on the deep learning algorithm.

Pilot imaging study of o-BMVC foci for discrimination of indeterminate cytology in diagnosing fine-needle aspiration of thyroid nodules,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-02887-8,06 Dec 2021,"Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy of a fluorescence probe, 3,6-bis(1-methyl-2-vinylpyridinium) carbazole diiodide (o-BMVC), provides an objective method for preoperative diagnosis of fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of thyroid nodules. The key of this o-BMVC test of FNA smears is the measurement of the digital number of o-BMVC foci in the nucleus. Thus, there are three categories classified in the o-BMVC test, which are nondiagnostic for unsatisfactory samples, benign for less numbers of o-BMVC foci, and malignant for more numbers of o-BMVC foci. The discrimination of indeterminate (including atypia, follicular neoplasm, suspicious) cytology into benign or malignant cases can reduce diagnostic uncertainty and benefit clinical decision making. This pilot study strongly suggests that the o-BMVC test is an invaluable method for diagnosing FNA samples. Particularly, the combination of FNA cytology and the o-BMVC test holds great promise to improve the efficacy of diagnosis and reduce the healthcare costs.",Conclusions not available,,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Azvudine is a thymus-homing anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug effective in treating COVID-19 patients,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-021-00835-6,06 Dec 2021,"Azvudine (FNC) is a nucleoside analog that inhibits HIV-1 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Recently, we discovered FNC an agent against SARS-CoV-2, and have taken it into Phase III trial for COVID-19 patients. FNC monophosphate analog inhibited SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-OC43 coronavirus with an EC50 between 1.2 and 4.3 μM, depending on viruses or cells, and selective index (SI) in 15–83 range. Oral administration of FNC in rats revealed a substantial thymus-homing feature, with FNC triphosphate (the active form) concentrated in the thymus and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Treating SARS-CoV-2 infected rhesus macaques with FNC (0.07 mg/kg, qd, orally) reduced viral load, recuperated the thymus, improved lymphocyte profiles, alleviated inflammation and organ damage, and lessened ground-glass opacities in chest X-ray. Single-cell sequencing suggested the promotion of thymus function by FNC. A randomized, single-arm clinical trial of FNC on compassionate use (n = 31) showed that oral FNC (5 mg, qd) cured all COVID-19 patients, with 100% viral ribonucleic acid negative conversion in 3.29 ± 2.22 days (range: 1–9 days) and 100% hospital discharge rate in 9.00 ± 4.93 days (range: 2–25 days). The side-effect of FNC is minor and transient dizziness and nausea in 16.12% (5/31) patients. Thus, FNC might cure COVID-19 through its anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity concentrated in the thymus, followed by promoted immunity.",Conclusions not available,Gen AI,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Antimicrobial resistance in commensal opportunistic pathogens isolated from non-sterile sites can be an effective proxy for surveillance in bloodstream infections,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-02755-5,03 Dec 2021,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance in bloodstream infections (BSIs) is challenging in low/middle-income countries (LMICs) given limited laboratory capacity.

In 8102 E. coli BSIs, 322,087 E. coli urinary tract infections, 6952 S. aureus BSIs and 112,074 S. aureus non-sterile site cultures from Oxfordshire (1998–2018), and other (55,296 isolates) rarer commensal opportunistic pathogens, antibiotic resistance trends over time in blood were strongly associated with those in other specimens (maximum cross-correlation per drug 0.51–0.99). Resistance prevalence was congruent across drug-years for each species (276/312 (88%) species-drug-years with prevalence within ± 10% between blood/other isolates). Results were similar across multiple countries in high/middle/low income-settings in the independent ATLAS dataset (103,559 isolates, 2004–2017) and three further LMIC hospitals/programmes (6154 isolates, 2008–2019). AMR in commensal opportunistic pathogens cultured from BSIs is strongly associated with AMR in commensal opportunistic pathogens cultured from non-sterile sites over calendar time, suggesting the latter could be used as an effective proxy for AMR surveillance in BSIs.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Earlier in the pandemic, the absence of sufficient training data prevented effective deep learning (DL) solutions for the diagnosis of COVID-19 based on X-Ray data. Here, addressing the lacunae in existing literature and algorithms with the paucity of initial training data; we describe CovBaseAI, an explainable tool using an ensemble of three DL models and an expert decision system (EDS) for COVID-Pneumonia diagnosis, trained entirely on pre-COVID-19 datasets. The performance and explainability of CovBaseAI was primarily validated on two independent datasets. Firstly, 1401 randomly selected CxR from an Indian quarantine center to assess effectiveness in excluding radiological COVID-Pneumonia requiring higher care. Second, curated dataset; 434 RT-PCR positive cases and 471 non-COVID/Normal historical scans, to assess performance in advanced medical settings. CovBaseAI had an accuracy of 87% with a negative predictive value of 98% in the quarantine-center data. However, sensitivity was 0.66–0.90 taking RT-PCR/radiologist opinion as ground truth. This work provides new insights on the usage of EDS with DL methods and the ability of algorithms to confidently predict COVID-Pneumonia while reinforcing the established learning; that benchmarking based on RT-PCR may not serve as reliable ground truth in radiological diagnosis.

Our objective is to prioritize repurposable drugs using a pipeline that systematically integrates the interaction between COVID-19 and drugs, deep graph neural networks, and in vitro/population-based validations. We first collected all available drugs (n = 3635) related to COVID-19 patient treatment through CTDbase. We built a COVID-19 knowledge graph based on the interactions among virus baits, host genes, pathways, drugs, and phenotypes. A deep graph neural network approach was used to derive the candidate drug’s representation based on the biological interactions. We prioritized the candidate drugs using clinical trial history, and then validated them with their genetic profiles, in vitro experimental efficacy, and population-based treatment effect. We highlight the top 22 drugs including Azithromycin, Atorvastatin, Aspirin, Acetaminophen, and Albuterol. We further pinpointed drug combinations that may synergistically target COVID-19. In summary, we demonstrated that the integration of extensive interactions, deep neural networks, and multiple evidence can facilitate the rapid identification of candidate drugs for COVID-19 treatment.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Using suitable keywords, three major databases including Web of Science, PubMed and Scopus, were searched. The results for prosodic features such as mean pitch, pitch range and variability, speech rate, intensity and voice duration were extracted from eligible studies. The pooled standard mean difference between ASD and control groups was extracted or calculated. Using I2 statistic and Cochrane Q-test, between-study heterogeneity was evaluated. Furthermore, publication bias was assessed using funnel plot and its significance was evaluated using Egger’s and Begg’s tests. Thirty-nine eligible studies were retrieved (including 910 and 850 participants for ASD and control groups, respectively). This systematic review and meta-analysis showed that ASD group members had a significantly larger mean pitch (SMD =  − 0.4, 95% CI [− 0.70, − 0.10]), larger pitch range (SMD =  − 0.78, 95% CI [− 1.34, − 0.21]), longer voice duration (SMD =  − 0.43, 95% CI [− 0.72, − 0.15]), and larger pitch variability (SMD = − 0.46, 95% CI [− 0.84, − 0.08]), compared with typically developing control group. However, no significant differences in pitch standard deviation, voice intensity and speech rate were found between groups. Chronological age of participants and voice elicitation tasks were two sources of between-study heterogeneity. Furthermore, no publication bias was observed during analyses (p > 0.05).

Combining machine learning and conventional statistical approaches for risk factor discovery in a large cohort study,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-02476-9,26 Nov 2021,"We present a simple and efficient hypothesis-free machine learning pipeline for risk factor discovery that accounts for non-linearity and interaction in large biomedical databases with minimal variable pre-processing. In this study, mortality models were built using gradient boosting decision trees (GBDT) and important predictors were identified using a Shapley values-based feature attribution method, SHAP values. Cox models controlled for false discovery rate were used for confounder adjustment, interpretability, and further validation. The pipeline was tested using information from 502,506 UK Biobank participants, aged 37–73 years at recruitment and followed over seven years for mortality registrations. From the 11,639 predictors included in GBDT, 193 potential risk factors had SHAP values ≥ 0.05, passed the correlation test, and were selected for further modelling. Of the total variable importance summed up, 60% was directly health related, and baseline characteristics, sociodemographics, and lifestyle factors each contributed about 10%. Cox models adjusted for baseline characteristics, showed evidence for an association with mortality for 166 out of the 193 predictors. These included mostly well-known risk factors (e.g., age, sex, ethnicity, education, material deprivation, smoking, physical activity, self-rated health, BMI, and many disease outcomes). For 19 predictors we saw evidence for an association in the unadjusted but not adjusted analyses, suggesting bias by confounding. Our GBDT-SHAP pipeline was able to identify relevant predictors ‘hidden’ within thousands of variables, providing an efficient and pragmatic solution for the first stage of hypothesis free risk factor identification.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Direct pixel to pixel principal strain mapping from tagging MRI using end to end deep convolutional neural network (DeepStrain),https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-02279-y,26 Nov 2021,"Regional soft tissue mechanical strain offers crucial insights into tissue's mechanical function and vital indicators for different related disorders. Tagging magnetic resonance imaging (tMRI) has been the standard method for assessing the mechanical characteristics of organs such as the heart, the liver, and the brain. However, constructing accurate artifact-free pixelwise strain maps at the native resolution of the tagged images has for decades been a challenging unsolved task. In this work, we developed an end-to-end deep-learning framework for pixel-to-pixel mapping of the two-dimensional Eulerian principal strains \(\varvec{{\varepsilon }}_{\boldsymbol{p1}}\) and \(\varvec{{\varepsilon }}_{\boldsymbol{p2}}\) directly from 1-1 spatial modulation of magnetization (SPAMM) tMRI at native image resolution using convolutional neural network (CNN). Four different deep learning conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) approaches were examined. Validations were performed using Monte Carlo computational model simulations, and in-vivo datasets, and compared to the harmonic phase (HARP) method, a conventional and validated method for tMRI analysis, with six different filter settings. Principal strain maps of Monte Carlo tMRI simulations with various anatomical, functional, and imaging parameters demonstrate artifact-free solid agreements with the corresponding ground-truth maps. Correlations with the ground-truth strain maps were R = 0.90 and 0.92 for the best-proposed cGAN approach compared to R = 0.12 and 0.73 for the best HARP method for \(\varvec{{\varepsilon }}_{\boldsymbol{p1}}\) and \(\varvec{{\varepsilon }}_{\boldsymbol{p2}}\), respectively. The proposed cGAN approach's error was substantially lower than the error in the best HARP method at all strain ranges. In-vivo results are presented for both healthy subjects and patients with cardiac conditions (Pulmonary Hypertension). Strain maps, obtained directly from their corresponding tagged MR images, depict for the first time anatomical, functional, and temporal details at pixelwise native high resolution with unprecedented clarity.

An ensemble-based approach for estimating personalized intraocular lens power,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-02288-x,25 Nov 2021,"The fundamental difference between modern formulae for intraocular lens (IOL) power calculation lies on the single ad hoc regression model they use to estimate the effective lens position (ELP). The ELP is very difficult to predict and its estimation is considered critical for an accurate prediction of the required IOL power of the lens to be implanted during cataract surgery. Hence, more advanced prediction techniques, which improve the prediction accuracy of the ELP, could play a decisive role in improving patient refractive outcomes. This study introduced a new approach for the calculation of personalized IOL power, which used an ensemble of regression models to devise a more accurate and robust prediction of the ELP. The concept of cross-validation was used to rigorously assess the performance of the devised formula against the most commonly used and published formulae. The results from this study show that overall, the proposed approach outperforms the most commonly used modern formulae (namely, Haigis, Holladay I, Hoffer Q and SRK/T) in terms of mean absolute prediction errors and prediction accuracy i.e., the percentage of eyes within ± 0.5D and ± 1 D ranges of prediction, for various ranges of axial lengths of the eyes. The new formula proposed in this study exhibited some promising features in terms of robustness. This enables the new formula to cope with variations in the axial length, the pre-operative anterior chamber depth and the keratometry readings of the corneal power; hence mitigating the impact of their measurement accuracy. Furthermore, the new formula performed well for both monofocal and multifocal lenses.",Conclusions not available,Traditional ML,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
COVID-19 assessment in family practice—A clinical decision rule based on self-rated symptoms and contact history,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41533-021-00258-4,25 Nov 2021,"The study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of contact history and clinical symptoms and to develop decision rules for ruling-in and ruling-out SARS-CoV-2 infection in family practice. We performed a prospective diagnostic study. Consecutive inclusion of patients coming for COVID-PCR testing to 19 general practices. Contact history and self-reported symptoms served as index test. PCR testing of nasopharyngeal swabs served as reference standard. Complete data were available from 1141 patients, 605 (53.0%) female, average age 42.2 years, 182 (16.0%) COVID-PCR positive. Multivariable logistic regression showed highest odds ratios (ORs) for “contact with infected person” (OR 9.22, 95% CI 5.61–15.41), anosmia/ageusia (8.79, 4.89–15.95), fever (4.25, 2.56–7.09), and “sudden disease onset” (2.52, 1.55–4.14). Patients with “contact with infected person” or “anosmia/ageusia” with or without self-reported “fever” had a high probability of COVID infection up to 84.8%. Negative response to the four items “contact with infected person, anosmia/ageusia, fever, sudden disease onset” showed a negative predictive value (NPV) of 0.98 (95% CI 0.96–0.99). This was present in 446 (39.1%) patients. NPV of “completely asymptomatic,” “no contact,” “no risk area” was 1.0 (0.96–1.0). This was present in 84 (7.4%) patients. To conclude, the combination of four key items allowed exclusion of SARS-CoV-2 infection with high certainty.

Nasopharyngeal microbiota in hospitalized children with Bordetella pertussis and Rhinovirus infection,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-02322-y,24 Nov 2021,"Despite great advances in describing Bordetella pertussis infection, the role of the host microbiota in pertussis pathogenesis remains unexplored. Indeed, the microbiota plays important role in defending against bacterial and viral respiratory infections. We investigated the nasopharyngeal microbiota in infants infected by B. pertussis (Bp), Rhinovirus (Rv) and simultaneously by both infectious agents (Bp + Rv). We demonstrated a specific nasopharyngeal microbiome profiles for Bp group, compared to Rv and Bp + Rv groups, and a reduction of microbial richness during coinfection compared to the single infections. The comparison amongst the three groups showed the increase of Alcaligenaceae and Achromobacter in Bp and Moraxellaceae and Moraxella in Rv group. Furthermore, correlation analysis between patients’ features and nasopharyngeal microbiota profile highlighted a link between delivery and feeding modality, antibiotic administration and B. pertussis infection. A model classification demonstrated a microbiota fingerprinting specific of Bp and Rv infections. In conclusion, external factors since the first moments of life contribute to the alteration of nasopharyngeal microbiota, indeed increasing the susceptibility of the host to the pathogens' infections. When the infection is triggered, the presence of infectious agents modifies the microbiota favoring the overgrowth of commensal bacteria that turn in pathobionts, hence contributing to the disease severity.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Feasibility study of portable multi-energy computed tomography with photon-counting detector for preclinical and clinical applications,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-02210-5,23 Nov 2021,"In this study, preclinical experiments were performed with an in-house developed prototypal photon-counting detector computed tomography (PCD CT) system. The performance of the system was compared with the conventional energy-integrating detector (EID)-based CT, concerning the basic image quality biomarkers and the respective capacities for material separation. The pre- and the post-contrast axial images of a canine brain captured by the PCD CT and EID CT systems were found to be visually similar. Multi-energy images were acquired using the PCD CT system, and machine learning-based material decomposition was performed to segment the white and gray matters for the first time in soft tissue segmentation. Furthermore, to accommodate clinical applications that require high resolution acquisitions, a small, native, high-resolution (HR) detector was implemented on the PCD CT system, and its performance was evaluated based on animal experiments. The HR acquisition mode improved the spatial resolution and delineation of the fine structures in the canine’s nasal turbinates compared to the standard mode. Clinical applications that rely on high-spatial resolution expectedly will also benefit from this resolution-enhancing function. The results demonstrate the potential impact on the brain tissue segmentation, improved detection of the liver tumors, and capacity to reconstruct high-resolution images both preclinically and clinically.","In this study, preclinical experiments were performed using a prototypal PCD CT system developed in-house to compare its image quality and assess its material separation capability and high-resolution characteristics.

Machine learning approach for the prediction of postpartum hemorrhage in vaginal birth,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-02198-y,19 Nov 2021,"Postpartum hemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal morbidity. Clinical prediction of postpartum hemorrhage remains challenging, particularly in the case of a vaginal birth. We studied machine learning models to predict postpartum hemorrhage. Women who underwent vaginal birth at the Tokyo Women Medical University East Center between 1995 and 2020 were included. We used 11 clinical variables to predict a postpartum hemorrhage defined as a blood loss of > 1000 mL. We constructed five machine learning models and a deep learning model consisting of neural networks with two layers after applying the ensemble learning of five machine learning classifiers, namely, logistic regression, a support vector machine, random forest, boosting trees, and decision tree. For an evaluation of the performance, we applied the area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic (AUC), the accuracy, false positive rate (FPR) and false negative rate (FNR). The importance of each variable was evaluated through a comparison of the feature importance calculated using a Boosted tree. A total of 9,894 patients who underwent vaginal birth were enrolled in the study, including 188 cases (1.9%) with blood loss of > 1000 mL. The best learning model predicted postpartum hemorrhage with an AUC of 0.708, an accuracy of 0.686, FPR of 0.312, and FNR of 0.398. The analysis of the importance of the variables showed that pregnant gestation of labor, the maternal weight upon admission of labor, and the maternal weight before pregnancy were considered to be weighted factors. Machine learning model can predict postpartum hemorrhage during vaginal delivery. Further research should be conducted to analyze appropriate variables and prepare big data, such as hundreds of thousands of cases.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
A weighted patient network-based framework for predicting chronic diseases using graph neural networks,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-01964-2,19 Nov 2021,"Chronic disease prediction is a critical task in healthcare. Existing studies fulfil this requirement by employing machine learning techniques based on patient features, but they suffer from high dimensional data problems and a high level of bias. We propose a framework for predicting chronic disease based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to address these issues. We begin by projecting a patient-disease bipartite graph to create a weighted patient network (WPN) that extracts the latent relationship among patients. We then use GNN-based techniques to build prediction models. These models use features extracted from WPN to create robust patient representations for chronic disease prediction. We compare the output of GNN-based models to machine learning methods by using cardiovascular disease and chronic pulmonary disease. The results show that our framework enhances the accuracy of chronic disease prediction. The model with attention mechanisms achieves an accuracy of 93.49% for cardiovascular disease prediction and 89.15% for chronic pulmonary disease prediction. Furthermore, the visualisation of the last hidden layers of GNN-based models shows the pattern for the two cohorts, demonstrating the discriminative strength of the framework. The proposed framework can help stakeholders improve health management systems for patients at risk of developing chronic diseases and conditions.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Remote diagnosis of surgical-site infection using a mobile digital intervention: a randomised controlled trial in emergency surgery patients,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-021-00526-0,18 Nov 2021,"Surgical site infections (SSI) cause substantial morbidity and pose a burden to acute healthcare services after surgery. We aimed to investigate whether a smartphone-delivered wound assessment tool can expedite diagnosis and treatment of SSI after emergency abdominal surgery. This single-blinded randomised control trial (NCT02704897) enroled adult emergency abdominal surgery patients in two tertiary care hospitals. Patients were randomised (1:1) to routine postoperative care or additional access to a smartphone-delivered wound assessment tool for 30-days postoperatively. Patient-reported SSI symptoms and wound photographs were requested on postoperative days 3, 7, and 15. The primary outcome was time-to-diagnosis of SSI (Centers for Disease Control definition). 492 patients were randomised (smartphone intervention: 223; routine care: 269). There was no significant difference in the 30-day SSI rate between trial arms: 21 (9.4%) in smartphone vs 20 (7.4%, p = 0.513) in routine care. Among the smartphone group, 32.3% (n = 72) did not utilise the tool. There was no significant difference in time-to-diagnosis of SSI for patients receiving the intervention (−2.5 days, 95% CI: −6.6−1.6, p = 0.225). However, patients in the smartphone group had 3.7-times higher odds of diagnosis within 7 postoperative days (95% CI: 1.02−13.51, p = 0.043). The smartphone group had significantly reduced community care attendance (OR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.34−0.94, p = 0.030), similar hospital attendance (OR: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.28−1.96, p = 0.577), and significantly better experiences in accessing care (OR: 2.02, 95% CI: 1.17−3.53, p = 0.013).

Identifying subtypes of depression in clinician-annotated text: a retrospective cohort study,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-01954-4,17 Nov 2021,"Current criteria for depression are imprecise and do not accurately characterize its distinct clinical presentations. As a result, its diagnosis lacks clinical utility in both treatment and research settings. Data-driven efforts to refine criteria have typically focused on a limited set of symptoms that do not reflect the disorder’s heterogeneity. By contrast, clinicians often write about patients in depth, creating descriptions that may better characterize depression. However, clinical text is not commonly used to this end. Here we show that clinically relevant depressive subtypes can be derived from unstructured electronic health records. Five subtypes were identified amongst 18,314 patients with depression treated at a large mental healthcare provider by using unsupervised machine learning: severe-typical, psychotic, mild-typical, agitated, and anergic-apathetic. Subtypes were used to place patients in groups for validation; groups were found to be associated with future outcomes and characteristics that were consistent with the subtypes. These associations suggest that these categorizations are actionable due to their validity with respect to disease prognosis. Moreover, they were derived with automated techniques that might theoretically be widely implemented, allowing for future analyses in more varied populations and settings. Additional research, especially with respect to treatment response, may prove useful in further evaluation.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

This research aimed to create and evaluate a machine learning (ML) model enabling discrimination between cancer patients and healthy controls based on 5-min-ECG recordings. We selected 12 HRV features based on previous research and compared the results between cancer patients and healthy individuals using Wilcoxon sum-rank test. Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) identified the top five features, averaged over 5 min and employed them as input to three different ML. Next, we created an ensemble model based on a stacking method that aggregated the predictions from all three base classifiers. All HRV features were significantly different between the two groups. SDNN, RMSSD, pNN50%, HRV triangular index, and SD1 were selected by RFE and used as an input to three different ML. All three base-classifiers performed above chance level, RF being the most efficient with a testing accuracy of 83%. The ensemble model showed a classification accuracy of 86% and an AUC of 0.95. The results obtained by ML algorithms suggest HRV parameters could be a reliable input for differentiating between cancer patients and healthy controls.

Artificial intelligence model comparison for risk factor analysis of patent ductus arteriosus in nationwide very low birth weight infants cohort,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-01640-5,16 Nov 2021,"Despite the many comorbidities and high mortality rate in preterm infants with patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), therapeutic strategies vary depending on the clinical setting, and most studies of the related risk factors are based on small sample populations. We aimed to compare the performance of artificial intelligence (AI) analysis with that of conventional analysis to identify risk factors associated with symptomatic PDA (sPDA) in very low birth weight infants. This nationwide cohort study included 8369 very low birth weight (VLBW) infants. The participants were divided into an sPDA group and an asymptomatic PDA or spontaneously close PDA (nPDA) group. The sPDA group was further divided into treated and untreated subgroups. A total of 47 perinatal risk factors were collected and analyzed. Multiple logistic regression was used as a standard analytic tool, and five AI algorithms were used to identify the factors associated with sPDA. Combining a large database of risk factors from nationwide registries and AI techniques achieved higher accuracy and better performance of the PDA prediction tasks, and the ensemble methods showed the best performances.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
The Framing of machine learning risk prediction models illustrated by evaluation of sepsis in general wards,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-021-00529-x,15 Nov 2021,"Problem framing is critical to developing risk prediction models because all subsequent development work and evaluation takes place within the context of how a problem has been framed and explicit documentation of framing choices makes it easier to compare evaluation metrics between published studies. In this work, we introduce the basic concepts of framing, including prediction windows, observation windows, window shifts and event-triggers for a prediction that strongly affects the risk of clinician fatigue caused by false positives. Building on this, we apply four different framing structures to the same generic dataset, using a sepsis risk prediction model as an example, and evaluate how framing affects model performance and learning. Our results show that an apparently good model with strong evaluation results in both discrimination and calibration is not necessarily clinically usable. Therefore, it is important to assess the results of objective evaluations within the context of more subjective evaluations of how a model is framed.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Predicting 1p/19q co-deletion status from magnetic resonance imaging using deep learning in adult-type diffuse lower-grade gliomas: a discovery and validation study,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41374-021-00692-5,15 Nov 2021,"Determination of 1p/19q co-deletion status is important for the classification, prognostication, and personalized therapy in diffuse lower-grade gliomas (LGG). We developed and validated a deep learning imaging signature (DLIS) from preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for predicting the 1p/19q status in patients with LGG. The DLIS was constructed on a training dataset (n = 330) and validated on both an internal validation dataset (n = 123) and a public TCIA dataset (n = 102). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and precision recall curves (PRC) were used to measure the classification performance. The area under ROC curves (AUC) of the DLIS was 0.999 for training dataset, 0.986 for validation dataset, and 0.983 for testing dataset. The F1-score of the prediction model was 0.992 for training dataset, 0.940 for validation dataset, and 0.925 for testing dataset. Our data suggests that DLIS could be used to predict the 1p/19q status from preoperative imaging in patients with LGG.

Quantitative imaging of apoptosis following oncolytic virotherapy by magnetic resonance fingerprinting aided by deep learning,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-021-00809-7,11 Nov 2021,"Non-invasive imaging methods for detecting intratumoural viral spread and host responses to oncolytic virotherapy are either slow, lack specificity or require the use of radioactive or metal-based contrast agents. Here we show that in mice with glioblastoma multiforme, the early apoptotic responses to oncolytic virotherapy (characterized by decreased cytosolic pH and reduced protein synthesis) can be rapidly detected via chemical-exchange-saturation-transfer magnetic resonance fingerprinting (CEST-MRF) aided by deep learning. By leveraging a deep neural network trained with simulated magnetic resonance fingerprints, CEST-MRF can generate quantitative maps of intratumoural pH and of protein and lipid concentrations by selectively labelling the exchangeable amide protons of endogenous proteins and the exchangeable macromolecule protons of lipids, without requiring exogenous contrast agents. We also show that in a healthy volunteer, CEST-MRF yielded molecular parameters that are in good agreement with values from the literature. Deep-learning-aided CEST-MRF may also be amenable to the characterization of host responses to other cancer therapies and to the detection of cardiac and neurological pathologies.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

The combination with video recordings and signal analysis based on time-frequency decomposition, clustering, and machine learning algorithms provided non-invasive access to previously overlooked behavioral components. The detection of shaking/shivering provided an original readout of fear, distinct from but complementary to behavioral freezing.

Network analysis reveals rare disease signatures across multiple levels of biological organization,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-26674-1,09 Nov 2021,"Rare genetic diseases are typically caused by a single gene defect. Despite this clear causal relationship between genotype and phenotype, identifying the pathobiological mechanisms at various levels of biological organization remains a practical and conceptual challenge. Here, we introduce a network approach for evaluating the impact of rare gene defects across biological scales. We construct a multiplex network consisting of over 20 million gene relationships that are organized into 46 network layers spanning six major biological scales between genotype and phenotype. A comprehensive analysis of 3,771 rare diseases reveals distinct phenotypic modules within individual layers. These modules can be exploited to mechanistically dissect the impact of gene defects and accurately predict rare disease gene candidates. Our results show that the disease module formalism can be applied to rare diseases and generalized beyond physical interaction networks. These findings open up new venues to apply network-based tools for cross-scale data integration.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Volumetric X-ray scanning is emerging as a powerful ex vivo specimen imaging technique for analyzing resection margins, but X-rays lack contrast between non-malignant and malignant fibrous tissues. In this study, combined micro-CT and wide-field optical image radiomics were developed to classify malignancy of breast cancer tissues, demonstrating that X-ray/optical radiomics improve malignancy classification. Ninety-two standardized features were extracted from co-registered micro-CT and optical spatial frequency domain imaging samples extracted from 54 breast tumors exhibiting seven tissue subtypes confirmed by microscopic histological analysis. Multimodal feature sets improved classification performance versus micro-CT alone when adipose samples were included (AUC = 0.88 vs. 0.90; p-value = 3.65e−11) and excluded, focusing the classification task on exclusively non-malignant fibrous versus malignant tissues (AUC = 0.78 vs. 0.85; p-value = 9.33e−14).

A method to estimate probability of disease and vaccine efficacy from clinical trial immunogenicity data,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41541-021-00377-6,04 Nov 2021,"Vaccine efficacy is often assessed by counting disease cases in a clinical trial. A new quantitative framework proposed here (“PoDBAY,” Probability of Disease Bayesian Analysis), estimates vaccine efficacy (and confidence interval) using immune response biomarker data collected shortly after vaccination. Given a biomarker associated with protection, PoDBAY describes the relationship between biomarker and probability of disease as a sigmoid probability of disease (“PoD”) curve. The PoDBAY framework is illustrated using clinical trial simulations and with data for influenza, zoster, and dengue virus vaccines. The simulations demonstrate that PoDBAY efficacy estimation (which integrates the PoD and biomarker data), can be accurate and more precise than the standard (case-count) estimation, contributing to more sensitive and specific decisions than threshold-based correlate of protection or case-count-based methods. For all three vaccine examples, the PoD fit indicates a substantial association between the biomarkers and protection, and efficacy estimated by PoDBAY from relatively little immunogenicity data is predictive of the standard estimate of efficacy, demonstrating how PoDBAY can provide early assessments of vaccine efficacy. Methods like PoDBAY can help accelerate and economize vaccine development using an immunological predictor of protection. For example, in the current effort against the COVID-19 pandemic it might provide information to help prioritize (rank) candidates both earlier in a trial and earlier in development.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

The spatial coherence of the ESRF-EBS combined with our beamline equipment, sample preparation and scanning developments enabled us to perform non-destructive, three-dimensional (3D) scans with hierarchically increasing resolution at any location in whole human organs. We applied HiP-CT to image five intact human organ types: brain, lung, heart, kidney and spleen. HiP-CT provided a structural overview of each whole organ followed by multiple higher-resolution volumes of interest, capturing organotypic functional units and certain individual specialized cells within intact human organs. We demonstrate the potential applications of HiP-CT through quantification and morphometry of glomeruli in an intact human kidney and identification of regional changes in the tissue architecture in a lung from a deceased donor with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: data reconstruction; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Multiplexed immunofluorescence identifies high stromal CD68+PD-L1+ macrophages as a predictor of improved survival in triple negative breast cancer,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-01116-6,03 Nov 2021,"Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) comprises 10–15% of all breast cancers and has a poor prognosis with a high risk of recurrence within 5 years. PD-L1 is an important biomarker for patient selection for immunotherapy but its cellular expression and co-localization within the tumour immune microenvironment and associated prognostic value is not well defined. We aimed to characterise the phenotypes of immune cells expressing PD-L1 and determine their association with overall survival (OS) and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS). Using tissue microarrays from a retrospective cohort of TNBC patients from St George Hospital, Sydney (n = 244), multiplexed immunofluorescence (mIF) was used to assess staining for CD3, CD8, CD20, CD68, PD-1, PD-L1, FOXP3 and pan-cytokeratin on the Vectra Polaris™ platform and analysed using QuPath. Cox multivariate analyses showed high CD68+PD-L1+ stromal cell counts were associated with improved prognosis for OS (HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.33–0.95, p = 0.030) and BCSS (HR 0.47, 95% CI 0.25–0.88, p = 0.018) in the whole cohort and in patients receiving chemotherapy, improving incrementally upon the predictive value of PD-L1+ alone for BCSS. These data suggest that CD68+PD-L1+ status can provide clinically useful prognostic information to identify sub-groups of patients with good or poor prognosis and guide treatment decisions in TNBC.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: evasion; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Impact of GAN-based lesion-focused medical image super-resolution on the robustness of radiomic features,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-00898-z,01 Nov 2021,"Robust machine learning models based on radiomic features might allow for accurate diagnosis, prognosis, and medical decision-making. Unfortunately, the lack of standardized radiomic feature extraction has hampered their clinical use. Since the radiomic features tend to be affected by low voxel statistics in regions of interest, increasing the sample size would improve their robustness in clinical studies. Therefore, we propose a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based lesion-focused framework for Computed Tomography (CT) image Super-Resolution (SR); for the lesion (i.e., cancer) patch-focused training, we incorporate Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) into GAN-Constrained by the Identical, Residual, and Cycle Learning Ensemble (GAN-CIRCLE). At \(2\times \) SR, the proposed model achieved better perceptual quality with less blurring than the other considered state-of-the-art SR methods, while producing comparable results at \(4\times \) SR. We also evaluated the robustness of our model’s radiomic feature in terms of quantization on a different lung cancer CT dataset using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Intriguingly, the most important radiomic features in our PCA-based analysis were the most robust features extracted on the GAN-super-resolved images. These achievements pave the way for the application of GAN-based image Super-Resolution techniques for studies of radiomics for robust biomarker discovery.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Deep learning-based thin-section MRI reconstruction improves tumour detection and delineation in pre- and post-treatment pituitary adenoma,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-00558-2,29 Oct 2021,"Even a tiny functioning pituitary adenoma could cause symptoms; hence, accurate diagnosis and treatment are crucial for management. However, it is difficult to diagnose a small pituitary adenoma using conventional MR sequence. Deep learning-based reconstruction (DLR) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enables high-resolution thin-section imaging with noise reduction. In the present single-institution retrospective study of 201 patients, conducted between August 2019 and October 2020, we compared the performance of 1 mm DLR MRI with that of 3 mm routine MRI, using a combined imaging protocol to detect and delineate pituitary adenoma. Four readers assessed the adenomas in a pairwise fashion, and diagnostic performance and image preferences were compared between inexperienced and experienced readers. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was quantitatively assessed. New detection of adenoma, achieved using 1 mm DLR MRI, was not visualised using 3 mm routine MRI (overall: 6.5% [13/201]). There was no significant difference depending on the experience of the readers in new detections. Readers preferred 1 mm DLR MRI over 3 mm routine MRI (overall superiority 56%) to delineate normal pituitary stalk and gland, with inexperienced readers more preferred 1 mm DLR MRI than experienced readers. The SNR of 1 mm DLR MRI was 1.25-fold higher than that of the 3 mm routine MRI. In conclusion, the 1 mm DLR MRI achieved higher sensitivity in the detection of pituitary adenoma and provided better delineation of normal pituitary gland than 3 mm routine MRI.",Conclusions not available,DNN,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Disease variant prediction with deep generative models of evolutionary data,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04043-8,27 Oct 2021,"Quantifying the pathogenicity of protein variants in human disease-related genes would have a marked effect on clinical decisions, yet the overwhelming majority (over 98%) of these variants still have unknown consequences1,2,3. In principle, computational methods could support the large-scale interpretation of genetic variants. However, state-of-the-art methods4,5,6,7,8,9,10 have relied on training machine learning models on known disease labels. As these labels are sparse, biased and of variable quality, the resulting models have been considered insufficiently reliable11. Here we propose an approach that leverages deep generative models to predict variant pathogenicity without relying on labels. By modelling the distribution of sequence variation across organisms, we implicitly capture constraints on the protein sequences that maintain fitness. Our model EVE (evolutionary model of variant effect) not only outperforms computational approaches that rely on labelled data but also performs on par with, if not better than, predictions from high-throughput experiments, which are increasingly used as evidence for variant classification12,13,14,15,16. We predict the pathogenicity of more than 36 million variants across 3,219 disease genes and provide evidence for the classification of more than 256,000 variants of unknown significance. Our work suggests that models of evolutionary information can provide valuable independent evidence for variant interpretation that will be widely useful in research and clinical settings.",Conclusions not available,Gen AI,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Clinical knowledge extraction via sparse embedding regression (KESER) with multi-center large scale electronic health record data,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-021-00519-z,27 Oct 2021,"The increasing availability of electronic health record (EHR) systems has created enormous potential for translational research. However, it is difficult to know all the relevant codes related to a phenotype due to the large number of codes available. Traditional data mining approaches often require the use of patient-level data, which hinders the ability to share data across institutions. In this project, we demonstrate that multi-center large-scale code embeddings can be used to efficiently identify relevant features related to a disease of interest. We constructed large-scale code embeddings for a wide range of codified concepts from EHRs from two large medical centers. We developed knowledge extraction via sparse embedding regression (KESER) for feature selection and integrative network analysis. We evaluated the quality of the code embeddings and assessed the performance of KESER in feature selection for eight diseases. Besides, we developed an integrated clinical knowledge map combining embedding data from both institutions. The features selected by KESER were comprehensive compared to lists of codified data generated by domain experts. Features identified via KESER resulted in comparable performance to those built upon features selected manually or with patient-level data. The knowledge map created using an integrative analysis identified disease-disease and disease-drug pairs more accurately compared to those identified using single institution data. Analysis of code embeddings via KESER can effectively reveal clinical knowledge and infer relatedness among codified concepts. KESER bypasses the need for patient-level data in individual analyses providing a significant advance in enabling multi-center studies using EHR data.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

The impact of recency and adequacy of historical information on sepsis predictions using machine learning,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-00220-x,21 Oct 2021,"Sepsis is a major public and global health concern. Every hour of delay in detecting sepsis significantly increases the risk of death, highlighting the importance of accurately predicting sepsis in a timely manner. A growing body of literature has examined developing new or improving the existing machine learning (ML) approaches for timely and accurate predictions of sepsis. This study contributes to this literature by providing clear insights regarding the role of the recency and adequacy of historical information in predicting sepsis using ML. To this end, we implemented a deep learning model using a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) algorithm and compared it with six other ML algorithms based on numerous combinations of the prediction horizons (to capture information recency) and observation windows (to capture information adequacy) using different measures of predictive performance. Our results indicated that the BiLSTM algorithm outperforms all other ML algorithms and provides a great separability of the predicted risk of sepsis among septic versus non-septic patients. Moreover, decreasing the prediction horizon (in favor of information recency) always boosts the predictive performance; however, the impact of expanding the observation window (in favor of information adequacy) depends on the prediction horizon and the purpose of prediction. More specifically, when the prediction is responsive to the positive label (i.e., Sepsis), increasing historical data improves the predictive performance when the prediction horizon is short-moderate.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
A Poisson binomial-based statistical testing framework for comorbidity discovery across electronic health record datasets,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43588-021-00141-9,21 Oct 2021,"Discovering the concomitant occurrence of distinct medical conditions in a patient, also known as comorbidities, is a prerequisite for creating patient outcome prediction tools. Current comorbidity discovery applications are designed for small datasets and use stratification to control for confounding variables such as age, sex or ancestry. Stratification lowers false positive rates, but reduces power, as the size of the study cohort is decreased. Here we describe a Poisson binomial-based approach to comorbidity discovery (PBC) designed for big-data applications that circumvents the need for stratification. PBC adjusts for confounding demographic variables on a per-patient basis and models temporal relationships. We benchmark PBC using two datasets to compute comorbidity statistics on 4,623,841 pairs of potentially comorbid medical terms. The results of this computation are provided as a searchable web resource. Compared with current methods, the PBC approach reduces false positive associations while retaining statistical power to discover true comorbidities.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Uncovering of intraspecies macular heterogeneity in cynomolgus monkeys using hybrid machine learning optical coherence tomography image segmentation,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-99704-z,19 Oct 2021,"The fovea is a depression in the center of the macula and is the site of the highest visual acuity. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has contributed considerably in elucidating the pathologic changes in the fovea and is now being considered as an accompanying imaging method in drug development, such as antivascular endothelial growth factor and its safety profiling. Because animal numbers are limited in preclinical studies and automatized image evaluation tools have not yet been routinely employed, essential reference data describing the morphologic variations in macular thickness in laboratory cynomolgus monkeys are sparse to nonexistent. A hybrid machine learning algorithm was applied for automated OCT image processing and measurements of central retina thickness and surface area values. Morphological variations and the effects of sex and geographical origin were determined. Based on our findings, the fovea parameters are specific to the geographic origin. Despite morphological similarities among cynomolgus monkeys, considerable variations in the foveolar contour, even within the same species but from different geographic origins, were found. The results of the reference database show that not only the entire retinal thickness, but also the macular subfields, should be considered when designing preclinical studies and in the interpretation of foveal data.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: ; Attacker Capability: 
H3K23/H3K36 hypoacetylation and HDAC1 up-regulation are associated with adverse consequences in obstructive sleep apnea patients,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-00052-9,19 Oct 2021,"The aim of this study is to determine the roles of global histone acetylation (Ac)/methylation (me), their modifying enzymes, and gene-specific histone enrichment in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Global histone modifications, and their modifying enzyme expressions were assessed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 56 patients with OSA and 16 matched subjects with primary snoring (PS). HIF-1α gene promoter-specific H3K36Ac enrichment was assessed in another cohort (28 OSA, 8 PS). Both global histone H3K23Ac and H3K36Ac expressions were decreased in OSA patients versus PS subjects. H3K23Ac expressions were further decreased in OSA patients with prevalent hypertension. HDAC1 expressions were higher in OSA patients, especially in those with excessive daytime sleepiness, and reduced after more than 6 months of continuous positive airway pressure treatment. H3K79me3 expression was increased in those with high C-reactive protein levels. Decreased KDM6B protein expressions were noted in those with a high hypoxic load, and associated with a higher risk for incident cardiovascular events or hypertension. HIF-1α gene promoter-specific H3K36Ac enrichment was decreased in OSA patients versus PS subjects. In vitro intermittent hypoxia with re-oxygenation stimuli resulted in HDAC1 over-expression and HIF-1α gene promoter-specific H3K36Ac under-expression, while HDAC1 inhibitor, SAHA, reversed oxidative stress through inhibiting NOX1. In conclusions, H3K23/H3K36 hypoacetylation is associated with the development of hypertension and disease severity in sleep-disordered breathing patients, probably through up-regulation of HDAC1, while H3K79 hypermethylation is associated with higher risk of cardiovascular diseases, probably through down-regulation of KDM6B.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
"Exome sequencing and analysis of 454,787 UK Biobank participants",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04103-z,18 Oct 2021,"A major goal in human genetics is to use natural variation to understand the phenotypic consequences of altering each protein-coding gene in the genome. Here we used exome sequencing1 to explore protein-altering variants and their consequences in 454,787 participants in the UK Biobank study2. We identified 12 million coding variants, including around 1 million loss-of-function and around 1.8 million deleterious missense variants. When these were tested for association with 3,994 health-related traits, we found 564 genes with trait associations at P ≤ 2.18 × 10−11. Rare variant associations were enriched in loci from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), but most (91%) were independent of common variant signals. We discovered several risk-increasing associations with traits related to liver disease, eye disease and cancer, among others, as well as risk-lowering associations for hypertension (SLC9A3R2), diabetes (MAP3K15, FAM234A) and asthma (SLC27A3). Six genes were associated with brain imaging phenotypes, including two involved in neural development (GBE1, PLD1). Of the signals available and powered for replication in an independent cohort, 81% were confirmed; furthermore, association signals were generally consistent across individuals of European, Asian and African ancestry. We illustrate the ability of exome sequencing to identify gene–trait associations, elucidate gene function and pinpoint effector genes that underlie GWAS signals at scale.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

We hypothesized that prehospital diagnostic algorithms for strokes and their subcategories using machine learning could have high predictive value. Consecutive adult patients with suspected stroke as per emergency medical service personnel were enrolled in a prospective multicenter observational study in 12 hospitals in Japan. Five diagnostic algorithms using machine learning, including logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine, and eXtreme Gradient Boosting, were evaluated for stroke and subcategories including acute ischemic stroke with/without large vessel occlusions, intracranial hemorrhage, and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Of the 1446 patients in the analysis, 1156 (80%) were randomly included in the training (derivation) cohort and cohorts, and 290 (20%) were included in the test (validation) cohort. In the diagnostic algorithms for strokes using eXtreme Gradient Boosting had the highest diagnostic value (test data, area under the receiver operating curve 0.980). In the diagnostic algorithms for the subcategories using eXtreme Gradient Boosting had a high predictive value (test data, area under the receiver operating curve, acute ischemic stroke with/without large vessel occlusions 0.898/0.882, intracranial hemorrhage 0.866, subarachnoid hemorrhage 0.926).

Estimation of current and post-treatment retinal function in chronic central serous chorioretinopathy using artificial intelligence,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-99977-4,14 Oct 2021,"Refined understanding of the association of retinal microstructure with current and future (post-treatment) function in chronic central serous chorioretinopathy (cCSC) may help to identify patients that would benefit most from treatment. In this post-hoc analysis of data from the prospective, randomized PLACE trial (NCT01797861), we aimed to determine the accuracy of AI-based inference of retinal function from retinal morphology in cCSC. Longitudinal spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) data from 57 eyes of 57 patients from baseline, week 6–8 and month 7–8 post-treatment were segmented using deep-learning software. Fundus-controlled perimetry data were aligned to the SD-OCT data to extract layer thickness and reflectivity values for each test point. Point-wise retinal sensitivity could be inferred with a (leave-one-out) cross-validated mean absolute error (MAE) [95% CI] of 2.93 dB [2.40–3.46] (scenario 1) using random forest regression. With addition of patient-specific baseline data (scenario 2), retinal sensitivity at remaining follow-up visits was estimated even more accurately with a MAE of 1.07 dB [1.06–1.08]. In scenario 3, month 7–8 post-treatment retinal sensitivity was predicted from baseline SD-OCT data with a MAE of 3.38 dB [2.82–3.94]. Our study shows that localized retinal sensitivity can be inferred from retinal structure in cCSC using machine-learning. Especially, prediction of month 7–8 post-treatment sensitivity with consideration of the treatment as explanatory variable constitutes an important step toward personalized treatment decisions in cCSC.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Automatic identification of triple negative breast cancer in ultrasonography using a deep convolutional neural network,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-00018-x,14 Oct 2021,"Triple negative (TN) breast cancer is a subtype of breast cancer which is difficult for early detection and the prognosis is poor.

The results showed that the averaged area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of discriminating malignant from benign ones were 0.9789 (benign vs. TN), 0.9689 (benign vs. NTN). To discriminate TN from NTN breast cancer, the AUC was 0.9000, the accuracy was 88.89%, the sensitivity was 87.5%, and the specificity was 90.00%.

Effects of government policies on the spread of COVID-19 worldwide,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-99368-9,14 Oct 2021,"The outbreak of novel COVID-19 disease elicited a wide range of anti-contagion and economic policies like school closure, income support, contact tracing, and so forth, in the mitigation and suppression of the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, a systematic evaluation of these policies has not been made. Here, 17 implemented policies from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker dataset employed in 90 countries from December 31, 2019, to August 31, 2020, were analyzed. A Poisson regression model was applied to analyze the relationship between policies and daily confirmed cases using a generalized estimating equations approach. A lag is a fixed time displacement in time series data. With that, lagging (0, 3, 7, 10, and 14 days) was also considered during the analysis since the effects of policies implemented on a given day may affect the number of confirmed cases several days after implementation. The countries were divided into three groups depending on the number of waves of the pandemic observed in each country. Through subgroup analysis, we showed that with and without lagging, contact tracing and containment policies were significant for countries with two waves, while closing, economic, and health policies were significant for countries with three waves. Wave-specific analysis for each wave showed that significant health, economic, and containment policies varied across waves of the pandemic. Emergency investment in healthcare was consistently significant among the three groups of countries, while the Stringency index was significant among all waves of the pandemic. These findings may help in making informed decisions regarding whether, which, or when these policies should be intensified or lifted.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: ; Attacker Capability: 
Opposite response of blood vessels in the retina to 6° head-down tilt and long-duration microgravity,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41526-021-00165-5,14 Oct 2021,"The Spaceflight Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS), associated with the headward fluid shifts incurred in microgravity during long-duration missions, remains a high-priority health and performance risk for human space exploration. To help characterize the pathophysiology of SANS, NASA’s VESsel GENeration Analysis (VESGEN) software was used to map and quantify vascular adaptations in the retina before and after 70 days of bed rest at 6-degree Head-Down Tilt (HDT), a well-studied microgravity analog. Results were compared to the retinal vascular response of astronauts following 6-month missions to the International Space Station (ISS). By mixed effects modeling, the trends of vascular response were opposite. Vascular density decreased significantly in the 16 retinas of eight astronauts and in contrast, increased slightly in the ten retinas of five subjects after HDT (although with limited significance). The one astronaut retina diagnosed with SANS displayed the greatest vascular loss. Results suggest that microgravity is a major variable in the retinal mediation of fluid shifts that is not reproduced in this HDT bed rest model.",Conclusions not available,Gen AI,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Machine learning identification of specific changes in myeloid cell phenotype during bloodstream infections,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-99628-8,13 Oct 2021,"The early identification of bacteremia is critical for ensuring appropriate treatment of nosocomial infections in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. The aim of this study was to use flow cytometric data of myeloid cells as a biomarker of bloodstream infection (BSI). An eight-color antibody panel was used to identify seven monocyte and two dendritic cell subsets. In the learning cohort, immunophenotyping was applied to (1) control subjects, (2) postoperative heart surgery patients, as a model of noninfectious inflammatory responses, and (3) blood culture-positive patients. Of the complex changes in the myeloid cell phenotype, a decrease in myeloid and plasmacytoid dendritic cell numbers, increase in CD14+CD16+ inflammatory monocyte numbers, and upregulation of neutrophils CD64 and CD123 expression were prominent in BSI patients. An extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm called the “infection detection and ranging score” (iDAR), ranging from 0 to 100, was developed to identify infection-specific changes in 101 phenotypic variables related to neutrophils, monocytes and dendritic cells. The tenfold cross-validation achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of 0.988 (95% CI 0.985–1) for the detection of bacteremic patients. In an out-of-sample, in-house validation, iDAR achieved an AUROC of 0.85 (95% CI 0.71–0.98) in differentiating localized from bloodstream infection and 0.95 (95% CI 0.89–1) in discriminating infected from noninfected ICU patients. In conclusion, a machine learning approach was used to translate the changes in myeloid cell phenotype in response to infection into a score that could identify bacteremia with high specificity in ICU patients.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Machine learning for early discrimination between transient and persistent acute kidney injury in critically ill patients with sepsis,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-99840-6,12 Oct 2021,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is commonly present in critically ill patients with sepsis. Early prediction of short-term reversibility of AKI is beneficial to risk stratification and clinical treatment decision. The study sought to use machine learning methods to discriminate between transient and persistent sepsis-associated AKI. Septic patients who developed AKI within the first 48 h after ICU admission were identified from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III database. AKI was classified as transient or persistent according to the Acute Disease Quality Initiative workgroup consensus. Five prediction models using logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine, artificial neural network and extreme gradient boosting were constructed, and their performance was evaluated by out-of-sample testing. A simplified risk prediction model was also derived based on logistic regression and features selected by machine learning algorithms. A total of 5984 septic patients with AKI were included, 3805 (63.6%) of whom developed persistent AKI. The artificial neural network and logistic regression models achieved the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) among the five machine learning models (0.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.74–0.78). The simplified 14-variable model showed adequate discrimination, with the AUC being 0.76 (95% CI 0.73–0.78). At the optimal cutoff of 0.63, the sensitivity and specificity of the simplified model were 63% and 76% respectively. In conclusion, a machine learning-based simplified prediction model including routine clinical variables could be used to differentiate between transient and persistent AKI in critically ill septic patients. An easy-to-use risk calculator can promote its widespread application in daily clinical practice.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Over a year into the pandemic, we lack conclusive evidence on its effectiveness. To address this gap, we used a unique real world contact data set, collected during the rollout of the first Norwegian contact tracing app in the Spring of 2020. Our dataset involves millions of contacts between 12.5% of the adult population, which enabled us to measure the real-world app performance. The technological tracing efficacy was measured at 80%, and we estimated that at least 11.0% of the discovered close contacts could not have been identified by manual contact tracing. Our results also indicated that digital contact tracing can flag individuals with excessive contacts, which can help contain superspreading related outbreaks. The overall effectiveness of digital tracing depends strongly on app uptake, but significant impact can be achieved for moderate uptake numbers. Used as a supplement to manual tracing and other measures, digital tracing can be instrumental in controlling the pandemic.

Powered hip exoskeleton improves walking economy in individuals with above-knee amputation,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01515-2,11 Oct 2021,"Above-knee amputation severely reduces the mobility and quality of life of millions of individuals. Walking with available leg prostheses is highly inefficient, and poor walking economy is a major problem limiting mobility. Here we show that an autonomous powered hip exoskeleton assisting the residual limb significantly improves metabolic walking economy by 15.6 ± 2.9% (mean ± s.e.m.; two-tailed paired t-test, P = 0.002) in six individuals with above-knee amputation walking on a treadmill. The observed metabolic cost improvement is equivalent to removing a 12-kg backpack from a nonamputee individual. All participants were able to walk overground with the exoskeleton, including starting and stopping, without notable changes in gait balance or stability. This study shows that assistance of the user’s residual limb with a powered hip exoskeleton is a viable solution for improving amputee walking economy.

We present an international, prospective evaluation of our models’ performance across all states and counties in the USA and prefectures in Japan. Nationally, incident mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for predicting COVID-19 associated deaths during prospective deployment remained consistently <8% (US) and <29% (Japan), while cumulative MAPE remained <2% (US) and <10% (Japan). We show that our models perform well even during periods of considerable change in population behavior, and are robust to demographic differences across different geographic locations. We further demonstrate that our framework provides meaningful explanatory insights with the models accurately adapting to local and national policy interventions. Our framework enables counterfactual simulations, which indicate continuing Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions alongside vaccinations is essential for faster recovery from the pandemic, delaying the application of interventions has a detrimental effect, and allow exploration of the consequences of different vaccination strategies.

Of these, 504 patients had osteoporosis (T-score ≤ − 2.5), and 497 patients did not have osteoporosis. The 1001 images were randomly divided into three sets: 800 images for the training, 100 images for the validation, and 101 images for the test. Based on VGG16 equipped with nonlocal neural network, we developed a deep neural network (DNN) model. We calculated the confusion matrix and evaluated the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). We drew the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. A gradient-based class activation map (Grad-CAM) overlapping the original image was also used to visualize the model performance. Additionally, we performed external validation using 117 datasets. Our final DNN model showed an overall accuracy of 81.2%, sensitivity of 91.1%, and specificity of 68.9%. The PPV was 78.5%, and the NPV was 86.1%. The area under the ROC curve value was 0.867, indicating a reasonable performance for screening osteoporosis by simple hip radiography. The external validation set confirmed a model performance with an overall accuracy of 71.8% and an AUC value of 0.700. All Grad-CAM results from both internal and external validation sets appropriately matched the proximal femur cortex and trabecular patterns of the radiographs.

"Effect of an anti-adhesion agent on vision-based assessment of cervical adhesions after thyroid surgery: randomized, placebo-controlled trial",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-97919-8,07 Oct 2021,"Many patients experience cervical adhesions after thyroid surgery. To date, however, no studies have objectively measured the effects of anti-adhesion agents on cervical adhesion symptoms. This study evaluated the effects of an anti-adhesion agent on cervical adhesions after thyroid surgery, as determined using a system that measures the extent of marker movement objectively. One hundred patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to undergo thyroid surgery with or without the anti-adhesion agent Collabarrier. Using specially manufactured recording equipment, the position of the marker on neck skin was measured before surgery, and 2 weeks, 3 months, and 9 months after surgery. Relative change in marker distance, calculated by subtracting the marker position before surgery from the marker positions 2 weeks, 3 months, and 9 months after surgery, differed significantly in the groups of patients who underwent thyroid surgery with and without the anti-adhesion agent (P < 0.05). A novel measuring system can objectively evaluate the effectiveness of a thyroid anti-adhesion agent. The anti-adhesion agent used significantly reduced adhesions compared with the control group. The trial is registered at www.cris.nih.go.kr (KCT0005745; date of registration, 08/01/2021).",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
ATR-FTIR spectrum analysis of saliva samples from COVID-19 positive patients,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-99529-w,07 Oct 2021,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the latest biological hazard for the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Even though numerous diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2 have been proposed, new diagnosis strategies are being developed, looking for less expensive methods to be used as screening. This study aimed to establish salivary vibrational modes analyzed by attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy to detect COVID-19 biological fingerprints that allow the discrimination between COVID-19 and healthy patients. Clinical dates, laboratories, and saliva samples of COVID-19 patients (N = 255) and healthy persons (N = 1209) were obtained and analyzed through ATR-FTIR spectroscopy. Then, a multivariate linear regression model (MLRM) was developed. The COVID-19 patients showed low SaO2, cough, dyspnea, headache, and fever principally. C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, fibrinogen, d-dimer, and ferritin were the most important altered laboratory blood tests, which were increased. In addition, changes in amide I and immunoglobulin regions were evidenced in the FTIR spectra analysis, and the MLRM showed clear discrimination between both groups. Specific salivary vibrational modes employing ATR-FTIR spectroscopy were established; moreover, the COVID-19 biological fingerprint in saliva was characterized, allowing the COVID-19 detection using an MLRM, which could be helpful for the development of new diagnostic devices.","The present research established specific salivary vibrational modes employing ATR-FTIR spectroscopy and characterizing the COVID-19 biological fingerprint. These specific spectra can be used to detect possible carriers of the virus or patients who have presented the disease and retain some immunological respect. In any case, it is necessary to analyze and continue investigating the spectra in their different regions to determine their meaning with greater precision.In addition, these spectra have allowed us to identify a suitable region for COVID-19 detection. By performing the MLRM, the number of variables decreased considerably, which would help us think about viable techniques or devices for diagnosing diseases faster and cheaper.","Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Machine learning identifies the independent role of dysplasia in the prediction of response to chemotherapy in AML,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41375-021-01435-7,06 Oct 2021,"The independent prognostic impact of specific dysplastic features in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains controversial and may vary between genomic subtypes. We apply a machine learning framework to dissect the relative contribution of centrally reviewed dysplastic features and oncogenetics in 190 patients with de novo AML treated in ALFA clinical trials. One hundred and thirty-five (71%) patients achieved complete response after the first induction course (CR). Dysgranulopoiesis, dyserythropoiesis and dysmegakaryopoiesis were assessable in 84%, 83% and 63% patients, respectively. Multi-lineage dysplasia was present in 27% of assessable patients. Micromegakaryocytes (q = 0.01), hypolobulated megakaryocytes (q = 0.08) and hyposegmented granulocytes (q = 0.08) were associated with higher ELN-2017 risk. Using a supervised learning algorithm, the relative importance of morphological variables (34%) for the prediction of CR was higher than demographic (5%), clinical (2%), cytogenetic (25%), molecular (29%), and treatment (5%) variables. Though dysplasias had limited predictive impact on survival, a multivariate logistic regression identified the presence of hypolobulated megakaryocytes (p = 0.014) and micromegakaryocytes (p = 0.035) as predicting lower CR rates, independently of monosomy 7 (p = 0.013), TP53 (p = 0.004), and NPM1 mutations (p = 0.025).

Data were retrieved from the fourth Korea National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (2009), with information concerning 4744 participants’ TMDs, demographic factors, socioeconomic status, working conditions, and health-related determinants. Based on variable importance observed from the random forest, the top 20 determinants of self-reported TMDs were body mass index (BMI), household income (monthly), sleep (daily), obesity (subjective), health (subjective), working conditions (control, hygiene, respect, risks, and workload), occupation, education, region (metropolitan), residence type (apartment), stress, smoking status, marital status, and sex. The top 20 determinants of temporomandibular disorders determined via a doctor’s diagnosis were BMI, age, household income (monthly), sleep (daily), obesity (subjective), working conditions (control, hygiene, risks, and workload), household income (subjective), subjective health, education, smoking status, residence type (apartment), region (metropolitan), sex, marital status, and allergic rhinitis. This study supports the hypothesis, highlighting the importance of obesity, general health, stress, socioeconomic status, and working conditions in the management of TMDs.","Artificial intelligence provides a decision-support system to predict TMDs and to analyze their determinants.

Right frontal anxiolytic-sensitive EEG ‘theta’ rhythm in the stop-signal task is a theory-based anxiety disorder biomarker,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-99374-x,05 Oct 2021,"Psychiatric diagnoses currently rely on a patient’s presenting symptoms or signs, lacking much-needed theory-based biomarkers. Our neuropsychological theory of anxiety, recently supported by human imaging, is founded on a longstanding, reliable, rodent ‘theta’ brain rhythm model of human clinical anxiolytic drug action. We have now developed a human scalp EEG homolog—goal-conflict-specific rhythmicity (GCSR), i.e., EEG rhythmicity specific to a balanced conflict between goals (e.g., approach-avoidance). Critically, GCSR is consistently reduced by different classes of anxiolytic drug and correlates with clinically-relevant trait anxiety scores (STAI-T). Here we show elevated GCSR in student volunteers divided, after testing, on their STAI-T scores into low, medium, and high (typical of clinical anxiety) groups. We then tested anxiety disorder patients (meeting diagnostic criteria) and similar controls recruited separately from the community. The patient group had higher average GCSR than their controls—with a mixture of high and low GCSR that varied with, but cut across, conventional disorder diagnosis. Consequently, GCSR scores should provide the first theoretically-based biomarker that could help diagnose, and so redefine, a psychiatric disorder.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Understanding the effectiveness of government interventions against the resurgence of COVID-19 in Europe,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-26013-4,05 Oct 2021,"European governments use non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to control resurging waves of COVID-19. However, they only have outdated estimates for how effective individual NPIs were in the first wave. We estimate the effectiveness of 17 NPIs in Europe’s second wave from subnational case and death data by introducing a flexible hierarchical Bayesian transmission model and collecting the largest dataset of NPI implementation dates across Europe. Business closures, educational institution closures, and gathering bans reduced transmission, but reduced it less than they did in the first wave. This difference is likely due to organisational safety measures and individual protective behaviours—such as distancing—which made various areas of public life safer and thereby reduced the effect of closing them. Specifically, we find smaller effects for closing educational institutions, suggesting that stringent safety measures made schools safer compared to the first wave. Second-wave estimates outperform previous estimates at predicting transmission in Europe’s third wave.",Conclusions not available,Gen AI,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Clusters of science and health related Twitter users become more isolated during the COVID-19 pandemic,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-99301-0,04 Oct 2021,"COVID-19 represents the most severe global crisis to date whose public conversation can be studied in real time. To do so, we use a data set of over 350 million tweets and retweets posted by over 26 million English speaking Twitter users from January 13 to June 7, 2020. We characterize the retweet network to identify spontaneous clustering of users and the evolution of their interaction over time in relation to the pandemic’s emergence. We identify several stable clusters (super-communities), and are able to link them to international groups mainly involved in science and health topics, national elites, and political actors. The science- and health-related super-community received disproportionate attention early on during the pandemic, and was leading the discussion at the time. However, as the pandemic unfolded, the attention shifted towards both national elites and political actors, paralleled by the introduction of country-specific containment measures and the growing politicization of the debate. Scientific super-community remained present in the discussion, but experienced less reach and became more isolated within the network. Overall, the emerging network communities are characterized by an increased self-amplification and polarization. This makes it generally harder for information from international health organizations or scientific authorities to directly reach a broad audience through Twitter for prolonged time. These results may have implications for information dissemination along the unfolding of long-term events like epidemic diseases on a world-wide scale.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: ; Attacker Capability: 
VNIR–NIR hyperspectral imaging fusion targeting intraoperative brain cancer detection,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-99220-0,04 Oct 2021,"Currently, intraoperative guidance tools used for brain tumor resection assistance during surgery have several limitations. Hyperspectral (HS) imaging is arising as a novel imaging technique that could offer new capabilities to delineate brain tumor tissue in surgical-time. However, the HS acquisition systems have some limitations regarding spatial and spectral resolution depending on the spectral range to be captured. Image fusion techniques combine information from different sensors to obtain an HS cube with improved spatial and spectral resolution. This paper describes the contributions to HS image fusion using two push-broom HS cameras, covering the visual and near-infrared (VNIR) [400–1000 nm] and near-infrared (NIR) [900–1700 nm] spectral ranges, which are integrated into an intraoperative HS acquisition system developed to delineate brain tumor tissue during neurosurgical procedures. Both HS images were registered using intensity-based and feature-based techniques with different geometric transformations to perform the HS image fusion, obtaining an HS cube with wide spectral range [435–1638 nm]. Four HS datasets were captured to verify the image registration and the fusion process. Moreover, segmentation and classification methods were evaluated to compare the performance results between the use of the VNIR and NIR data, independently, with respect to the fused data. The results reveal that the proposed methodology for fusing VNIR–NIR data improves the classification results up to 21% of accuracy with respect to the use of each data modality independently, depending on the targeted classification problem.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Budget constrained machine learning for early prediction of adverse outcomes for COVID-19 patients,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-98071-z,01 Oct 2021,"The combination of machine learning (ML) and electronic health records (EHR) data may be able to improve outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 patients through improved risk stratification and patient outcome prediction. However, in resource constrained environments the clinical utility of such data-driven predictive tools may be limited by the cost or unavailability of certain laboratory tests. We leveraged EHR data to develop an ML-based tool for predicting adverse outcomes that optimizes clinical utility under a given cost structure. We further gained insights into the decision-making process of the ML models through an explainable AI tool. This cohort study was performed using deidentified EHR data from COVID-19 patients from ProMedica Health System in northwest Ohio and southeastern Michigan. We tested the performance of various ML approaches for predicting either increasing ventilatory support or mortality. We performed post hoc analysis to obtain optimal feature sets under various budget constraints. We demonstrate that it is possible to achieve a significant reduction in cost at the expense of a small reduction in predictive performance. For example, when predicting ventilation, it is possible to achieve a 43% reduction in cost with only a 3% reduction in performance. Similarly, when predicting mortality, it is possible to achieve a 50% reduction in cost with only a 1% reduction in performance. This study presents a quick, accurate, and cost-effective method to evaluate risk of deterioration for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection at the time of clinical evaluation.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Statistical uncertainty quantification to augment clinical decision support: a first implementation in sleep medicine,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-021-00515-3,30 Sept 2021,"Machine learning has the potential to change the practice of medicine, particularly in areas that require pattern recognition (e.g. radiology). Although automated classification is unlikely to be perfect, few modern machine learning tools have the ability to assess their own classification confidence to recognize uncertainty that might need human review. Using automated single-channel sleep staging as a first implementation, we demonstrated that uncertainty information (as quantified using Shannon entropy) can be utilized in a “human in the loop” methodology to promote targeted review of uncertain sleep stage classifications on an epoch-by-epoch basis. Across 20 sleep studies, this feedback methodology proved capable of improving scoring agreement with the gold standard over automated scoring alone (average improvement in Cohen’s Kappa of 0.28), in a fraction of the scoring time compared to full manual review (60% reduction). In summary, our uncertainty-based clinician-in-the-loop framework promotes the improvement of medical classification accuracy/confidence in a cost-effective and economically resourceful manner.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Evaluation of JATSdecoder as an automated text extraction tool for statistical results in scientific reports,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-98782-3,30 Sept 2021,"The extraction of statistical results in scientific reports is beneficial for checking studies on plausibility and reliability. The R package JATSdecoder supports the application of text mining approaches to scientific reports. Its function get.stats() extracts all reported statistical results from text and recomputes p values for most standard test results. The output can be reduced to results with checkable or computable p values only. In this article, get.stats()’s ability to extract, recompute and check statistical results is compared to that of statcheck, which is an already established tool. A manually coded data set, containing the number of statistically significant results in 49 articles, serves as an initial indicator for get.stats()’s and statcheck’s differing detection rates for statistical results. Further 13,531 PDF files by 10 mayor psychological journals, 18,744 XML documents by Frontiers of Psychology and 23,730 articles related to psychological research and published by PLoS One are scanned for statistical results with both algorithms. get.stats() almost replicates the manually extracted number of significant results in 49 PDF articles. get.stats() outperforms the statcheck functions in identifying statistical results in every included journal and input format. Furthermore, the raw results extracted by get.stats() increase statcheck’s detection rate. JATSdecoder’s function get.stats() is a highly general and reliable tool to extract statistical results from text. It copes with a wide range of textual representations of statistical standard results and recomputes p values for two- and one-sided tests. It facilitates manual and automated checks on consistency and completeness of the reported results within a manuscript.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: ; Attacker Capability:

In the present study, we attempted to investigate the presence of subclinical voice feature alteration in COVID-19 patients after the recent resolution of disease using deep learning. The study was a prospective study of 76 post COVID-19 patients and 40 healthy individuals. The diagnoses of post COVID-19 patients were based on more than the eighth week after onset of symptoms. Voice samples of an ‘ah’ sound, coughing sound and a polysyllabic sentence were collected and preprocessed to log-mel spectrogram. Transfer learning using the VGG19 pre-trained convolutional neural network was performed with all voice samples. The performance of the model using the polysyllabic sentence yielded the highest classification performance of all models. The coughing sound produced the lowest classification performance while the ability of the monosyllabic ‘ah’ sound to predict the recent COVID-19 fell between the other two vocalizations. The model using the polysyllabic sentence achieved 85% accuracy, 89% sensitivity, and 77% specificity. In conclusion, deep learning is able to detect the subtle change in voice features of COVID-19 patients after recent resolution of the disease.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Artificial intelligence-based image analysis can predict outcome in high-grade serous carcinoma via histology alone,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-98480-0,27 Sept 2021,"High-grade extrauterine serous carcinoma (HGSC) is an aggressive tumor with high rates of recurrence, frequent chemotherapy resistance, and overall 5-year survival of less than 50%. Beyond determining and confirming the diagnosis itself, pathologist review of histologic slides provides no prognostic or predictive information, which is in sharp contrast to almost all other carcinoma types. Deep-learning based image analysis has recently been able to predict outcome and/or identify morphology-based representations of underlying molecular alterations in other tumor types, such as colorectal carcinoma, lung carcinoma, breast carcinoma, and melanoma. Using a carefully stratified HGSC patient cohort consisting of women (n = 30) with similar presentations who experienced very different treatment responses (platinum free intervals of either ≤ 6 months or ≥ 18 months), we used whole slide images (WSI, n = 205) to train a convolutional neural network. The neural network was trained, in three steps, to identify morphologic regions (digital biomarkers) that are highly associating with one or the other treatment response group. We tested the classifier using a separate 22 slide test set, and 18/22 slides were correctly classified. We show that a neural network based approach can discriminate extremes in patient response to primary platinum-based chemotherapy with high sensitivity (73%) and specificity (91%). These proof-of-concept results are novel, because for the first time, prospective prognostic information is identified specifically within HGSC tumor morphology.",Conclusions not available,DNN,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Overcoming barriers to data sharing with medical image generation: a comprehensive evaluation,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-021-00507-3,24 Sept 2021,"Privacy concerns around sharing personally identifiable information are a major barrier to data sharing in medical research. In many cases, researchers have no interest in a particular individual’s information but rather aim to derive insights at the level of cohorts. Here, we utilise generative adversarial networks (GANs) to create medical imaging datasets consisting entirely of synthetic patient data. The synthetic images ideally have, in aggregate, similar statistical properties to those of a source dataset but do not contain sensitive personal information. We assess the quality of synthetic data generated by two GAN models for chest radiographs with 14 radiology findings and brain computed tomography (CT) scans with six types of intracranial haemorrhages. We measure the synthetic image quality by the performance difference of predictive models trained on either the synthetic or the real dataset. We find that synthetic data performance disproportionately benefits from a reduced number of classes. Our benchmark also indicates that at low numbers of samples per class, label overfitting effects start to dominate GAN training. We conducted a reader study in which trained radiologists discriminate between synthetic and real images. In accordance with our benchmark results, the classification accuracy of radiologists improves with an increasing resolution. Our study offers valuable guidelines and outlines practical conditions under which insights derived from synthetic images are similar to those that would have been derived from real data. Our results indicate that synthetic data sharing may be an attractive alternative to sharing real patient-level data in the right setting.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

In this study, we sought to characterize the clinical, morphologic, genetic, and epigenetic features of five uterine sarcomas that display histologic features of LGESS, HGESS, and PEComa. All tumors demonstrated epithelioid cells often associated with a low-grade spindled component resembling LGESS, with both regions expressing CD10, ER, PR, variable HMB45, and Melan-A immunoreactivity, and strong cathepsin K and pS6 expression. Targeted massively parallel sequencing analysis revealed the presence of somatic TSC2 mutations in all five cases, of which four harbored concurrent or consecutive JAZF1-SUZ12 gene fusions. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis of methylation profiles of TSC2-mutant uterine sarcomas (n = 4), LGESS (n = 10), and HGESS (n = 12) demonstrated two clusters consisting of (1) all LGESS and TSC2-mutant uterine sarcomas and (2) all HGESS. KEGG pathway analysis detected methylation differences in genes involved in PI3K/AKT, calcium, and Rap1 signaling. TSC2-mutant uterine sarcomas were responsive to hormone suppression, and mTOR inhibition demonstrated clinical benefit in four patients with these neoplasms.

Diagnosis is commonly performed with magnetic resonance imaging. Survival biomarkers are challenging to identify due to the relatively low numbers of individual tumor types. 69 children with biopsy-confirmed brain tumors were recruited into this study. All participants had perfusion and diffusion weighted imaging performed at diagnosis. Imaging data were processed using conventional methods, and a Bayesian survival analysis performed. Unsupervised and supervised machine learning were performed with the survival features, to determine novel sub-groups related to survival. Sub-group analysis was undertaken to understand differences in imaging features. Survival analysis showed that a combination of diffusion and perfusion imaging were able to determine two novel sub-groups of brain tumors with different survival characteristics (p < 0.01), which were subsequently classified with high accuracy (98%) by a neural network. Analysis of high-grade tumors showed a marked difference in survival (p = 0.029) between the two clusters with high risk and low risk imaging features.

Risk prediction of clinical adverse outcomes with machine learning in a cohort of critically ill patients with atrial fibrillation,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-97218-2,23 Sept 2021,"Critically ill patients affected by atrial fibrillation are at high risk of adverse events: however, the actual risk stratification models for haemorrhagic and thrombotic events are not validated in a critical care setting. With this paper we aimed to identify, adopting topological data analysis, the risk factors for therapeutic failure (in-hospital death or intensive care unit transfer), the in-hospital occurrence of stroke/TIA and major bleeding in a cohort of critically ill patients with pre-existing atrial fibrillation admitted to a stepdown unit; to engineer newer prediction models based on machine learning in the same cohort. We selected all medical patients admitted for critical illness and a history of pre-existing atrial fibrillation in the timeframe 01/01/2002–03/08/2007. All data regarding patients’ medical history, comorbidities, drugs adopted, vital parameters and outcomes (therapeutic failure, stroke/TIA and major bleeding) were acquired from electronic medical records. Risk factors for each outcome were analyzed adopting topological data analysis. Machine learning was used to generate three different predictive models. We were able to identify specific risk factors and to engineer dedicated clinical prediction models for therapeutic failure (AUC: 0.974, 95%CI: 0.934–0.975), stroke/TIA (AUC: 0.931, 95%CI: 0.896–0.940; Brier score: 0.13) and major bleeding (AUC: 0.930:0.911–0.939; Brier score: 0.09) in critically-ill patients, which were able to predict accurately their respective clinical outcomes. Topological data analysis and machine learning techniques represent a concrete viewpoint for the physician to predict the risk at the patients’ level, aiding the selection of the best therapeutic strategy in critically ill patients affected by pre-existing atrial fibrillation.","In critically ill patients with pre-existing AF, the classical risk scores adopted to predict stroke/TIA and MB are not effective and should not be used to guide the therapeutic approach during a hospitalization into such a high level of clinical complexity. Big data analysis with TDA allowed us to identify specific risk factors associated with stroke/TIA and MB in this clinical setting. ML techniques were able to outperform classical risk scores. Moreover, in this paper we have also challenged tools to debug the ML models and understand the classification outputs. We believe this is a seminal step toward the instrumentation of a ML framework compliant with the GDPR-22nd article “right to be informed”.","Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Differences are not explained by parental anthropometry or comorbidities, polygenic risk score, breastfeeding, or illnesses.

Vaginal microbiome as a tool for prediction of chorioamnionitis in preterm labor: a pilot study,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-98587-4,23 Sept 2021,"Intra-amniotic infection (IAI) is a major cause of preterm birth with a poor perinatal prognosis. We aimed to determine whether analyzing vaginal microbiota can evaluate the risk of chorioamnionitis (CAM) in preterm labor cases. Vaginal discharge samples were collected from 83 pregnant women admitted for preterm labor. Based on Blanc’s classification, the participants were divided into CAM (stage ≥ II; n = 46) and non-CAM (stage ≤ I; n = 37) groups. The 16S rDNA amplicons (V1–V2) from vaginal samples were sequenced and analyzed. Using a random forest algorithm, the bacterial species associated with CAM were identified, and a predictive CAM (PCAM) scoring method was developed. The α diversity was significantly higher in the CAM than in the non-CAM group (P < 0.001). The area under the curve was 0.849 (95% confidence interval 0.765–0.934) using the PCAM score. Among patients at < 35 weeks of gestation, the PCAM group (n = 22) had a significantly shorter extended gestational period than the non-PCAM group (n = 25; P = 0.022). Multivariate analysis revealed a significant difference in the frequency of developmental disorders in 3-year-old infants (PCAM, 28%, non-PCAM, 4%; P = 0.022). Analyzing vaginal microbiota can evaluate the risk of IAI. Future studies should establish appropriate interventions for IAI high-risk patients to improve perinatal prognosis.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Deep learning-based prediction of early cerebrovascular events after transcatheter aortic valve replacement,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-98265-5,21 Sept 2021,"Cerebrovascular events (CVE) are among the most feared complications of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). CVE appear difficult to predict due to their multifactorial origin incompletely explained by clinical predictors. We aimed to build a deep learning-based predictive tool for TAVR-related CVE. Integrated clinical and imaging characteristics from consecutive patients enrolled into a prospective TAVR registry were analysed. CVE comprised any strokes and transient ischemic attacks. Predictive variables were selected by recursive feature reduction to train an autoencoder predictive model. Area under the curve (AUC) represented the model’s performance to predict 30-day CVE. Among 2279 patients included between 2007 and 2019, both clinical and imaging data were available in 1492 patients. Median age was 83 years and STS score was 4.6%. Acute (< 24 h) and subacute (day 2–30) CVE occurred in 19 (1.3%) and 36 (2.4%) patients, respectively. The occurrence of CVE was associated with an increased risk of death (HR [95% CI] 2.62 [1.82–3.78]). The constructed predictive model uses less than 107 clinical and imaging variables and has an AUC of 0.79 (0.65–0.93). TAVR-related CVE can be predicted using a deep learning-based predictive algorithm. The model is implemented online for broad usage.","Despite their complex pathophysiology and rarity, TAVR-related CVE can be predicted by using artificial neural networks. The model is implemented online for broad usage (https://www.welcome.alviss.ai/#/cvecalculator). The proposed approach illustrates the potential of artificial intelligence in developing prediction models for multifactorial adverse events such as CVE.","Traditional ML, DNN",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Heart failure clinical care analysis uncovers risk reduction opportunities for preserved ejection fraction subtype,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-97831-1,20 Sept 2021,"Heart failure (HF) has no cure and, for HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), no life-extending treatments. Defining the clinical epidemiology of HF could facilitate earlier identification of high-risk individuals. We define the clinical epidemiology of HF subtypes (HFpEF and HF with reduced ejection fraction [HFrEF]), identified among 2.7 million individuals receiving routine clinical care. Differences in patterns and rates of accumulation of comorbidities, frequency of hospitalization, use of specialty care, were defined for each HF subtype. Among 28,156 HF cases, 8322 (30%) were HFpEF and 11,677 (42%) were HFrEF. HFpEF was the more prevalent subtype among older women. 177 Phenotypes differentially associated with HFpEF versus HFrEF. HFrEF was more frequently associated with diagnoses related to ischemic cardiac injury while HFpEF was associated more with non-cardiac comorbidities and HF symptoms. These comorbidity patterns were frequently present 3 years prior to a HFpEF diagnosis. HF subtypes demonstrated distinct patterns of clinical co-morbidities and disease progression. For HFpEF, these comorbidities were often non-cardiac and manifested prior to the onset of a HF diagnosis. Recognizing these comorbidity patterns, along the care continuum, may present a window of opportunity to identify individuals at risk for developing incident HFpEF.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Multimetric feature selection for analyzing multicategory outcomes of colorectal cancer: random forest and multinomial logistic regression models,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41374-021-00662-x,18 Sept 2021,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide, and a leading cause of cancer deaths. Better classifying multicategory outcomes of CRC with clinical and omic data may help adjust treatment regimens based on individual’s risk. Here, we selected the features that were useful for classifying four-category survival outcome of CRC using the clinical and transcriptomic data, or clinical, transcriptomic, microsatellite instability and selected oncogenic-driver data (all data) of TCGA. We also optimized multimetric feature selection to develop the best multinomial logistic regression (MLR) and random forest (RF) models that had the highest accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score, respectively. We identified 2073 differentially expressed genes of the TCGA RNASeq dataset. MLR overall outperformed RF in the multimetric feature selection. In both RF and MLR models, precision, recall and F1 score increased as the feature number increased and peaked at the feature number of 600–1000, while the models’ accuracy remained stable. The best model was the MLR one with 825 features based on sum of squared coefficients using all data, and attained the best accuracy of 0.855, F1 of 0.738 and precision of 0.832, which were higher than those using clinical and transcriptomic data. The top-ranked features in the MLR model of the best performance using clinical and transcriptomic data were different from those using all data. However, pathologic staging, HBS1L, TSPYL4, and TP53TG3B were the overlapping top-20 ranked features in the best models using clinical and transcriptomic, or all data. Thus, we developed a multimetric feature-selection based MLR model that outperformed RF models in classifying four-category outcome of CRC patients. Interestingly, adding microsatellite instability and oncogenic-driver data to clinical and transcriptomic data improved models’ performances. Precision and recall of tuned algorithms may change significantly as the feature number changes, but accuracy appears not sensitive to these changes.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
A deep learning approach for successful big-bubble formation prediction in deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-98157-8,17 Sept 2021,"The efficacy of deep learning in predicting successful big-bubble (SBB) formation during deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) was evaluated. Medical records of patients undergoing DALK at the University of Cologne, Germany between March 2013 and July 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into two groups: (1) SBB or (2) failed big-bubble (FBB). Preoperative images of anterior segment optical coherence tomography and corneal biometric values (corneal thickness, corneal curvature, and densitometry) were evaluated. A deep neural network model, Visual Geometry Group-16, was selected to test the validation data, evaluate the model, create a heat map image, and calculate the area under the curve (AUC). This pilot study included 46 patients overall (11 women, 35 men). SBBs were more common in keratoconus eyes (KC eyes) than in corneal opacifications of other etiologies (non KC eyes) (p = 0.006). The AUC was 0.746 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.603–0.889). The determination success rate was 78.3% (18/23 eyes) (95% CI 56.3–92.5%) for SBB and 69.6% (16/23 eyes) (95% CI 47.1–86.8%) for FBB. This automated system demonstrates the potential of SBB prediction in DALK.

Optimization of psoriasis assessment system based on patch images,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-97211-9,13 Sept 2021,"Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that occurs in various forms throughout the body and is associated with certain conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, and depression. The psoriasis area severity index (PASI) score, a tool used to evaluate the severity of psoriasis, is currently used in clinical trials and clinical research. The determination of severity is based on the subjective judgment of the clinician. Thus, the disease evaluation deviations are induced. Therefore, we propose optimal algorithms that can effectively segment the lesion area and classify the severity. In addition, a new dataset on psoriasis was built, including patch images of erythema and scaling. We performed psoriasis lesion segmentation and classified the disease severity. In addition, we evaluated the best-performing segmentation method and classifier and analyzed features that are highly related to the severity of psoriasis. In conclusion, we presented the optimal techniques for evaluating the severity of psoriasis. Our newly constructed dataset improved the generalization performance of psoriasis diagnosis and evaluation. It proposed an optimal system for specific evaluation indicators of the disease and a quantitative PASI scoring method. The proposed system can help to evaluate the severity of localized psoriasis more accurately.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Utilizing machine learning to improve clinical trial design for acute respiratory distress syndrome,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-021-00505-5,09 Sept 2021,"Heterogeneous patient populations, complex pharmacology and low recruitment rates in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) have led to the failure of many clinical trials. Recently, machine learning (ML) emerged as a new technology to process and identify big data relationships, enabling a new era in clinical trial design. In this study, we designed a ML model for predictively stratifying acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients, ultimately reducing the required number of patients by increasing statistical power through cohort homogeneity. From the Philips eICU Research Institute (eRI) database, no less than 51,555 ARDS patients were extracted. We defined three subpopulations by outcome: (1) rapid death, (2) spontaneous recovery, and (3) long-stay patients. A retrospective univariate analysis identified highly predictive variables for each outcome. All 220 variables were used to determine the most accurate and generalizable model to predict long-stay patients. Multiclass gradient boosting was identified as the best-performing ML model. Whereas alterations in pH, bicarbonate or lactate proved to be strong predictors for rapid death in the univariate analysis, only the multivariate ML model was able to reliably differentiate the disease course of the long-stay outcome population (AUC of 0.77). We demonstrate the feasibility of prospective patient stratification using ML algorithms in the by far largest ARDS cohort reported to date. Our algorithm can identify patients with sufficiently long ARDS episodes to allow time for patients to respond to therapy, increasing statistical power. Further, early enrollment alerts may increase recruitment rate.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Assessing outcomes of ear molding therapy by health care providers and convolutional neural network,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-97310-7,09 Sept 2021,"Ear molding therapy is a nonsurgical technique to correct certain congenital auricular deformities. While the advantages of nonsurgical treatments over otoplasty are well-described, few studies have assessed aesthetic outcomes. In this study, we compared assessments of outcomes of ear molding therapy for 283 ears by experienced healthcare providers and a previously developed deep learning CNN model. 2D photographs of ears were obtained as a standard of care in our onsite photography studio. Physician assistants (PAs) rated the photographs using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1(poor) to 5(excellent) and the CNN assessment was categorical, classifying each photo as either “normal” or “deformed”. On average, the PAs classified 75.6% of photographs as good to excellent outcomes (scores 4 and 5). Similarly, the CNN classified 75.3% of the photographs as normal. The inter-rater agreement between the PAs ranged between 72 and 81%, while there was a 69.6% agreement between the machine model and the inter-rater majority agreement between at least two PAs (i.e., when at least two PAs gave a simultaneous score < 4 or ≥ 4). This study shows that noninvasive ear molding therapy has excellent outcomes in general. In addition, it indicates that with further training and validation, machine learning techniques, like CNN, have the capability to accurately mimic provider assessment while removing the subjectivity of human evaluation making it a robust tool for ear deformity identification and outcome evaluation.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Early identification of sepsis is important as it allows timely administration of potentially life-saving resuscitation and antimicrobial therapy. We present COMPOSER (COnformal Multidimensional Prediction Of SEpsis Risk), a deep learning model for the early prediction of sepsis, specifically designed to reduce false alarms by detecting unfamiliar patients/situations arising from erroneous data, missingness, distributional shift and data drifts. COMPOSER flags these unfamiliar cases as indeterminate rather than making spurious predictions. Six patient cohorts (515,720 patients) curated from two healthcare systems in the United States across intensive care units (ICU) and emergency departments (ED) were used to train and externally and temporally validate this model. In a sequential prediction setting, COMPOSER achieved a consistently high area under the curve (AUC) (ICU: 0.925–0.953; ED: 0.938–0.945). Out of over 6 million prediction windows roughly 20% and 8% were identified as indeterminate amongst non-septic and septic patients, respectively. COMPOSER provided early warning within a clinically actionable timeframe (ICU: 12.2 [3.2 22.8] and ED: 2.1 [0.8 4.5] hours prior to first antibiotics order) across all six cohorts, thus allowing for identification and prioritization of patients at high risk for sepsis.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Recent advances in federated learning enable building complex machine-learned models that are trained in a distributed fashion. These techniques facilitate the calculation of research study endpoints such that private data never leaves a given device or healthcare system. We show—on a diverse set of single and multi-site health studies—that federated models can achieve similar accuracy, precision, and generalizability, and lead to the same interpretation as standard centralized statistical models while achieving considerably stronger privacy protections and without significantly raising computational costs. This work is the first to apply modern and general federated learning methods that explicitly incorporate differential privacy to clinical and epidemiological research—across a spectrum of units of federation, model architectures, complexity of learning tasks and diseases. As a result, it enables health research participants to remain in control of their data and still contribute to advancing science—aspects that used to be at odds with each other.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Development of an exosomal gene signature to detect residual disease in dogs with osteosarcoma using a novel xenograft platform and machine learning,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41374-021-00655-w,06 Sept 2021,"Osteosarcoma has a guarded prognosis. A major hurdle in developing more effective osteosarcoma therapies is the lack of disease-specific biomarkers to predict risk, prognosis, or therapeutic response. Exosomes are secreted extracellular microvesicles emerging as powerful diagnostic tools. However, their clinical application is precluded by challenges in identifying disease-associated cargo from the vastly larger background of normal exosome cargo. We developed a method using canine osteosarcoma in mouse xenografts to distinguish tumor-derived from host-response exosomal messenger RNAs (mRNAs). The model allows for the identification of canine osteosarcoma-specific gene signatures by RNA sequencing and a species-differentiating bioinformatics pipeline. An osteosarcoma-associated signature consisting of five gene transcripts (SKA2, NEU1, PAF1, PSMG2, and NOB1) was validated in dogs with spontaneous osteosarcoma by real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR), while a machine learning model assigned dogs into healthy or disease groups. Serum/plasma exosomes were isolated from 53 dogs in distinct clinical groups (“healthy”, “osteosarcoma”, “other bone tumor”, or “non-neoplastic disease”). Pre-treatment samples from osteosarcoma cases were used as the training set, and a validation set from post-treatment samples was used for testing, classifying as “osteosarcoma detected” or “osteosarcoma-NOT detected”. Dogs in a validation set whose post-treatment samples were classified as “osteosarcoma-NOT detected” had longer remissions, up to 15 months after treatment. In conclusion, we identified a gene signature predictive of molecular remissions with potential applications in the early detection and minimal residual disease settings. These results provide proof of concept for our discovery platform and its utilization in future studies to inform cancer risk, diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic response.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Comparison of the antiremodeling effects of losartan and mirabegron in a rat model of uremic cardiomyopathy,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-96815-5,01 Sept 2021,"Uremic cardiomyopathy is characterized by diastolic dysfunction (DD), left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), and fibrosis. Angiotensin-II plays a major role in the development of uremic cardiomyopathy via nitro-oxidative and inflammatory mechanisms. In heart failure, the beta-3 adrenergic receptor (β3-AR) is up-regulated and coupled to endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)-mediated pathways, exerting antiremodeling effects. We aimed to compare the antiremodeling effects of the angiotensin-II receptor blocker losartan and the β3-AR agonist mirabegron in uremic cardiomyopathy. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) was induced by 5/6th nephrectomy in male Wistar rats. Five weeks later, rats were randomized into four groups: (1) sham-operated, (2) CKD, (3) losartan-treated (10 mg/kg/day) CKD, and (4) mirabegron-treated (10 mg/kg/day) CKD groups. At week 13, echocardiographic, histologic, laboratory, qRT-PCR, and Western blot measurements proved the development of uremic cardiomyopathy with DD, LVH, fibrosis, inflammation, and reduced eNOS levels, which were significantly ameliorated by losartan. However, mirabegron showed a tendency to decrease DD and fibrosis; but eNOS expression remained reduced. In uremic cardiomyopathy, β3-AR, sarcoplasmic reticulum ATPase (SERCA), and phospholamban levels did not change irrespective of treatments. Mirabegron reduced the angiotensin-II receptor 1 expression in uremic cardiomyopathy that might explain its mild antiremodeling effects despite the unchanged expression of the β3-AR.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

T1-weighted and resting-state functional magnetic resonance images of 112 patients with BD were obtained, and patients were segregated according to diagnostic subtype (i.e., types I and II) and clinical patterns, including the number of episodes and hospitalizations and history of suicide and psychosis. For each clinical pattern, fewer and more occurrences subgroups and types I and II were classified through nested cross-validation for robust performance, with minimum redundancy and maximum relevance, in feature selection. To assess the proportion of variance in cognitive performance explained by the neurobiological markers, multiple linear regression between verbal memory and the selected features was conducted. Satisfactory performance (mean accuracy, 73.60%) in classifying patients with a high or low number of episodes was attained through functional connectivity, mostly from default-mode and motor networks. Moreover, these neurobiological markers explained 62% of the variance in verbal memory. The number of episodes is a potentially critical aspect of the neuropathology of BD. Neurobiological markers can help identify BD neuroprogression.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Identification of markers that distinguish adipose tissue and glucose and insulin metabolism using a multi-modal machine learning approach,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-95688-y,23 Aug 2021,"The study of metabolomics has improved our knowledge of the biology behind type 2 diabetes and its related metabolic physiology. We aimed to investigate markers of adipose tissue morphology, as well as insulin and glucose metabolism in 53 non-obese male individuals. The participants underwent extensive clinical, biochemical and magnetic resonance imaging phenotyping, and we also investigated non-targeted serum metabolites. We used a multi-modal machine learning approach to evaluate which serum metabolomic compounds predicted markers of glucose and insulin metabolism, adipose tissue morphology and distribution. Fasting glucose was associated with metabolites of intracellular insulin action and beta-cell dysfunction, namely cysteine-s-sulphate and n-acetylgarginine, whereas fasting insulin was predicted by myristoleoylcarnitine, propionylcarnitine and other metabolites of beta-oxidation of fatty acids. OGTT-glucose levels at 30 min were predicted by 7-Hoca, a microbiota derived metabolite, as well as eugenol, a fatty acid. Both insulin clamp and HOMA-IR were predicted by metabolites involved in beta-oxidation of fatty acids and biodegradation of triacylglycerol, namely tartrate and 3-phosphoglycerate, as well as pyruvate, xanthine and liver fat. OGTT glucose area under curve (AUC) and OGTT insulin AUC, was associated with bile acid metabolites, subcutaneous adipocyte cell size, liver fat and fatty chain acids and derivates, such as isovalerylcarnitine. Finally, subcutaneous adipocyte size was associated with long chain fatty acids, markers of sphingolipid metabolism, increasing liver fat and dopamine-sulfate 1. Ectopic liver fat was predicted by methylmalonate, adipocyte cell size, glutathione derived metabolites and fatty chain acids. Ectopic heart fat was predicted visceral fat, gamma-glutamyl tyrosine and 2-acetamidophenol sulfate. Adipocyte cell size, age, alpha-tocopherol and blood pressure were associated with visceral fat. We identified several biomarkers associated with adipose tissue pathophysiology and insulin and glucose metabolism using a multi-modal machine learning approach. Our approach demonstrated the relative importance of serum metabolites and they outperformed traditional clinical and biochemical variables for most endpoints.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: ; Attacker Capability: 
Personalized lab test models to quantify disease potentials in healthy individuals,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01468-6,23 Aug 2021,"Standardized lab tests are central for patient evaluation, differential diagnosis and treatment. Interpretation of these data is nevertheless lacking quantitative and personalized metrics. Here we report on the modeling of 2.1 billion lab measurements of 92 different lab tests from 2.8 million adults over a span of 18 years. Following unsupervised filtering of 131 chronic conditions and 5,223 drug–test pairs we performed a virtual survey of lab tests distributions in healthy individuals. Age and sex alone explain less than 10% of the within-normal test variance in 89 out of 92 tests. Personalized models based on patients’ history explain 60% of the variance for 17 tests and over 36% for half of the tests. This allows for systematic stratification of the risk for future abnormal test levels and subsequent emerging disease. Multivariate modeling of within-normal lab tests can be readily implemented as a basis for quantitative patient evaluation.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Distribution of diabetic retinopathy in diabetes mellitus patients and its association rules with other eye diseases,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-96438-w,20 Aug 2021,"The study aims to explore the distribution characteristics and influencing factors of diabetic retinopathy (DR) in diabetes mellitus (DM) patients and association rules of eye diseases in these patients. Data were obtained from 1284 DM patients at Henan Provincial People’s Hospital. Association rules were employed to calculate the probability of the common occurrence of eye-related diseases in DM patients. A web visualization network diagram was used to display the association rules of the eye-related diseases in DM patients. DR prevalence in people aged < 40 years (≥ 58.5%) was higher than that in those aged 50–60 years (≤ 43.7%). Patients with DM in rural areas were more likely to have DR than those in urban areas (56.2% vs. 35.6%, P < 0.001). DR prevalence in Pingdingshan City (68.4%) was significantly higher than in other cities. The prevalence of DR in patients who had DM for ≥ 5 years was higher than in other groups (P < 0.001). About 33.07% of DM patients had both diabetic maculopathy and DR, and 36.02% had both diabetic maculopathy and cataracts. The number of strong rules in patients ≥ 60 years old was more than those in people under 60 in age, and those in rural areas had more strong rules than those in urban areas. DM patients with one or more eye diseases are at higher risks of other eye diseases than general DM patients. These association rules are affected by factors such as age, region, disease duration, and DR severity.",Conclusions not available,Gen AI,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

This research aims to develop and validate prediction models, using the UK Biobank, to estimate COVID-19 mortality risk in confirmed cases. From the 11,245 participants testing positive for COVID-19, we develop a data-driven random forest classification model with excellent performance (AUC: 0.91), using baseline characteristics, pre-existing conditions, symptoms, and vital signs, such that the score could dynamically assess mortality risk with disease deterioration. We also identify several significant novel predictors of COVID-19 mortality with equivalent or greater predictive value than established high-risk comorbidities, such as detailed anthropometrics and prior acute kidney failure, urinary tract infection, and pneumonias. The model design and feature selection enables utility in outpatient settings. Possible applications include supporting individual-level risk profiling and monitoring disease progression across patients with COVID-19 at-scale, especially in hospital-at-home settings.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
A national assessment of elective cesarean sections in Bangladesh and the need for health literacy and accessibility,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-96337-0,19 Aug 2021,"There has been a gradual rise in the number of cesarean sections (CSs) in Bangladesh. The present study identified the cohort of women, who were more likely to opt for an elective CS based on their sociodemographic characteristics, pre-delivery care history, and media exposure, using the Bangladesh Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey-2019. The survey stratification adjusted logistic regression model and interpretable machine learning method of building classification trees were utilized to analyze a sample of 9202 women, alongside district-wise heat maps. One-in-five births (20%) were elective CSs in the 2 years prior to the survey. Women residing in affluent households with educated house-heads, who accessed antenatal care prior to delivery (AOR 4.12; 95% CI 3.06, 5.54) with regular access to media (AOR 1.31; 95% CI 1.10, 1.56) and who owned a mobile phone (AOR 1.25; 95% CI 1.04, 1.50) were more likely to opt for elective CSs, which suggests that health access and health literacy were crucial factors in women’s mode of delivery. Spatial analyses revealed that women living in larger cities had more elective CS deliveries, pointing towards the availability of better health and access to multiple safe delivery options in peripheral areas.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Effects of a large-scale social media advertising campaign on holiday travel and COVID-19 infections: a cluster randomized controlled trial,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01487-3,19 Aug 2021,"During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic, many health professionals used social media to promote preventative health behaviors. We conducted a randomized controlled trial of the effect of a Facebook advertising campaign consisting of short videos recorded by doctors and nurses to encourage users to stay at home for the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays (NCT04644328 and AEARCTR-0006821). We randomly assigned counties to high intensity (n = 410 (386) at Thanksgiving (Christmas)) or low intensity (n = 410 (381)). The intervention was delivered to a large fraction of Facebook subscribers in 75% and 25% of randomly assigned zip codes in high- and low-intensity counties, respectively. In total, 6,998 (6,716) zip codes were included, and 11,954,109 (23,302,290) users were reached at Thanksgiving (Christmas). The first two primary outcomes were holiday travel and fraction leaving home, both measured using mobile phone location data of Facebook users. Average distance traveled in high-intensity counties decreased by −0.993 percentage points (95% confidence interval (CI): –1.616, −0.371; P = 0.002) for the 3 days before each holiday compared to low-intensity counties. The fraction of people who left home on the holiday was not significantly affected (adjusted difference: 0.030; 95% CI: −0.361, 0.420; P = 0.881). The third primary outcome was COVID-19 infections recorded at the zip code level in the 2-week period starting 5 days after the holiday. Infections declined by 3.5% (adjusted 95% CI: −6.2%, −0.7%; P = 0.013) in intervention compared to control zip codes. Social media messages recorded by health professionals before the winter holidays in the United States led to a significant reduction in holiday travel and subsequent COVID-19 infections.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: ; Attacker Capability: 
Cancer-associated fibroblasts are associated with poor prognosis in solid type of lung adenocarcinoma in a machine learning analysis,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-96344-1,18 Aug 2021,"Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) participate in critical processes in the tumor microenvironment, such as extracellular matrix remodeling, reciprocal signaling interactions with cancer cells and crosstalk with infiltrating inflammatory cells. However, the relationships between CAFs and survival are not well known in lung cancer. The aim of this study was to reveal the correlations of CAFs with survival rates, genetic alterations and immune activities. This study reviewed the histological features of 517 patients with lung adenocarcinoma from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. We performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), network-based analysis and survival analysis based on CAFs in four histological types of lung adenocarcinoma: acinar, papillary, micropapillary and solid. We found four hallmark gene sets, the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis, hypoxia, and inflammatory response gene sets, that were associated with the presence of CAFs. CAFs were associated with tumor proliferation, elevated memory CD4+T cells and high CD274 (encoding PD-L1) expression. In the pathway analyses, CAFs were related to blood vessel remodeling, matrix organization, negative regulation of apoptosis and transforming growth factor-β signaling. In the survival analysis of each histological type, CAFs were associated with poor prognosis in the solid type. These results may contribute to the development of therapeutic strategies against lung adenocarcinoma cases in which CAFs are present.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
A simple and fast spectroscopy-based technique for Covid-19 diagnosis,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-95568-5,18 Aug 2021,"The coronavirus pandemic, which appeared in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, rapidly spread all over the world in only a few weeks. Faster testing techniques requiring less resources are key in managing the pandemic, either to enable larger scale testing or even just provide developing countries with limited resources, particularly in Africa, means to perform tests to manage the crisis. Here, we report an unprecedented, rapid, reagent-free and easy-to-use screening spectroscopic method for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 on RNA extracts. This method, validated on clinical samples collected from 280 patients with quantitative predictive scores on both positive and negative samples, is based on a multivariate analysis of FTIR spectra of RNA extracts. This technique, in agreement with RT-PCR, achieves 97.8% accuracy, 97% sensitivity and 98.3% specificity while reducing the testing time post RNA extraction from hours to minutes. Furthermore, this technique can be used in several laboratories with limited resources.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Evaluation of focus and deep learning methods for automated image grading and factors influencing image quality in adaptive optics ophthalmoscopy,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-96068-2,17 Aug 2021,"Adaptive optics flood illumination ophthalmoscopy (AO-FIO) is an established imaging tool in the investigation of retinal diseases. However, the clinical interpretation of AO-FIO images can be challenging due to varied image quality. Therefore, image quality assessment is essential before interpretation. An image assessment tool will also assist further work on improving the image quality, either during acquisition or post processing. In this paper, we describe, validate and compare two automated image quality assessment methods; the energy of Laplacian focus operator (LAPE; not commonly used but easily implemented) and convolutional neural network (CNN; effective but more complex approach). We also evaluate the effects of subject age, axial length, refractive error, fixation stability, disease status and retinal location on AO-FIO image quality. Based on analysis of 10,250 images of 50 × 50 μm size, at 41 retinal locations, from 50 subjects we demonstrate that CNN slightly outperforms LAPE in image quality assessment. CNN achieves accuracy of 89%, whereas LAPE metric achieves 73% and 80% (for a linear regression and random forest multiclass classifier methods, respectively) compared to ground truth. Furthermore, the retinal location, age and disease are factors that can influence the likelihood of poor image quality.","The development of automated grading systems for AO-FIO image quality are needed to facilitate accurate large volume image-grading of AO-FIO images. The result in this report is based on a robust ground truth grading method as demonstrated by the substantial inter-grader agreement in our simple 3-category manual grading system.CNN performed well when compared with manual grading results, achieving an overall classification accuracy of 89% when tested on a dataset of 5,535 images. Previously published reports on using CNN for classification of normal or mild vs moderate or severe diabetic retinopathy have achieved accuracies in the range of 90%, using large data sets of 80,000 to 120,000 images26, 27. Lam et al. introduced an automatic diabetic retinopathy grading system capable of classifying images based on disease pathologies from four severity levels. Their algorithm achieved 95% evaluation accuracy using 35,000 images with 5 class labels (normal, mild, moderate, severe, end stage)9. The performance of deep learning methods, like the one used in this study, is known to improve with increasing number of images. Therefore, the performance of the proposed CNN can be improved further with increasing the size of AO-FIO datasets.We could not find any report that describes the use of the focus operator (LAPE) as an automated method for image grading. Our results showed that the focus operator applied to 5,535 images obtained a classification performance of 73% (linear regression classification model) and 80% (random forest classifier), which indicates that precision of performance can be improved with the choice of a more complex algorithm to solve the classification problem. However, in both cases obtained results are less accurate than the CNN.The cause of poor image quality in AO-FIO images is mostly associated with the presence of retinal disease, retinal location and age. The quality of AO-FIO images can be degraded by defocus. Further degradation of image quality can occur in diseased eye when defocused light is reflected back from cellular debris or other cells types (e.g. retinal pigment epithelial cells) in the outer retinal layers, thus reducing signal to noise ratio. It is also the case that although photoreceptor cells may appear structurally intact, a loss of function of these cells may impair its wave-guiding properties and this can have a deleterious impact on image sharpness28. Other factors thought to influence the reflectivity of the photoreceptor outer segments include time of day, natural physiological variation within cells, photocurrent dynamics inducing refractive index changes, and the coherence properties of the projected light29,30,31. Additionally, rapid eye movement and wavefront aberrations that have been unaccounted for in the device may also contribute to reductions in image quality, hence presenting significant challenges to the clinical interpretation of AO-FIO images32, 33. For example, Chew et al. have reported exclusion of approximately 40% of images due to image quality in their analyzed data set16. Debellemaniere et al. had to exclude at least one eye from 46.9% of subjects due to poor AO image quality in their study of patients taking hydroxychloroquine without any evidence of maculopathy34. Furthermore, Feng et al. reported that in their study of AO-FIO images of healthy subjects aged 14 to 69, the images from 52.7% were excluded due to image quality35. We showed a similar frequency of images belonging to categories 2 (unacceptable for evaluation), being 50–60% at retinal loci spanning 2° to 6° from the foveal center. Image rejection rate was even higher for retinal loci at 7° and 8° (75%), 9° (95%) from the foveal center (Fig. 3). Further investigation will be required into the robustness of the methods with regard to the number of valid images required in order to make a valid classification.There are a number of limitations in our study. Images taken for the analysis had only a narrow range of retinal disease diagnoses and the imaging was performed by clinicians with varying levels of experience in operating the AO-FIO instrument. Therefore, further evaluation is required in a larger and more diverse cohort of patients. We didn’t measure the intra-individual variation of our manual grading and we didn’t investigate its impact on the quantitative AO-FIO measurements and their repeatability.The proposed AO-FIO image automated grading system could be incorporated into AO-FIO image acquisition software to determine image quality and inform users when acquisition should be repeated or the image interpreted with caution. Similar solutions have already been applied in commercial optical coherence tomography/angiography devices and have been well received.The current limitation of the proposed grading system is its inability to categorize causes of impaired cone visualization; it is unknown whether the poor image quality is due to retinal disease, imaging artifact, or perhaps a combination of both. Retinal pathology is an unlikely explanation in our cohort since patients in both DSM and HCQ groups had only mild structural damage and complete loss of cone photoreceptor cells was not expected. However, further studies are required to distinguish between cone loss due to retinal pathology and inability to resolve cones due to poor image quality. This might increase the applicability of the modality to the evaluation of a range of retinal pathologies. Nevertheless, our proposed methodology at least allows us to reduce the number of images that should be revised by a clinician or researcher to decide if one should proceed with qualitative or quantitative analysis. Following Gale et al.’s recommendation we also suggest correlation between AO-FIO images and other retinal imaging modalities, including optical coherence tomography and fundus autofluorescence, to increase confidence in the AO-FIO results.3,4 AO-FIO is a powerful imaging modality, which also presents its own challenges in data interpretation. Further improvement in automatic image grading methods has the potential to increase the utility of this imaging modality in clinical practice.In summary, we have demonstrated that our CNN classifier outperforms a defocus measurement classifier using the LAPE values (random forest multiclass classifier method and a linear regression) in AO-FIO image quality assessment (accuracy: 89% vs 84% vs 73%). However, further improvement of the algorithm and/or increase in size of the training dataset should be undertaken to achieve a better performance to match results obtained by expert level grader (accuracy: 97%). Retinal location and age are the only parameters that impact on the frequency of poor-quality images. We recommend limiting the collection of AO-FIO images to retinal loci between 2° and 6° from the foveal center to maximize the frequency of obtaining analyzable images.","Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
A particle swarm optimization approach for predicting the number of COVID-19 deaths,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-96057-5,16 Aug 2021,"The rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has raised huge concerns about the prospect of a major health disaster that would result in a huge number of deaths. This anxiety was largely fueled by the fact that the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), responsible for the disease, was so far unknown, and therefore an accurate prediction of the number of deaths was particularly difficult. However, this prediction is of the utmost importance for public health authorities to make the most reliable decisions and establish the necessary precautions to protect people’s lives. In this paper, we present an approach for predicting the number of deaths from COVID-19. This approach requires modeling the number of infected cases using a generalized logistic function and using this function for inferring the number of deaths. An estimate of the parameters of the proposed model is obtained using a Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (PSO) that requires iteratively solving a quadratic programming problem. In addition to the total number of deaths and number of infected cases, the model enables the estimation of the infection fatality rate (IFR). Furthermore, using some mild assumptions, we derive estimates of the number of active cases. The proposed approach was empirically assessed on official data provided by the State of Qatar. The results of our computational study show a good accuracy of the predicted number of deaths.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Radiomic feature extraction from the whole lung (whole-lung radiomics analysis) and imaging- and dosimetric-based segmentation (multi-region radiomics analysis) were performed. Patients with RP grade ≥ 2 or < 2 were classified. Predictors were selected with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator logistic regression and the model was built with neural network classifiers. A total of 49,383 radiomics features per patient image were extracted from the radiotherapy planning computed tomography. We identified 4 features and 13 radiomics features in the whole-lung and multi-region radiomics analysis for classification, respectively. The accuracy and area under the curve (AUC) without the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) were 60.8%, and 0.62 for whole-lung and 80.1%, and 0.84 for multi-region radiomics analysis. These were improved 1.7% for whole-lung and 2.1% for multi-region radiomics analysis with the SMOTE. The developed multi-region radiomics analysis can help predict grade ≥ 2 RP. The radiomics features in the median- and high-dose regions, and the local intensity roughness and variation were important factors in predicting grade ≥ 2 RP.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Pathogenic nsSNPs that increase the risks of cancers among the Orang Asli and Malays,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-95618-y,09 Aug 2021,"Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most common genetic variations for various complex human diseases, including cancers. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous SNPs that increase cancer risks, such as breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and leukemia. These SNPs were cataloged for scientific use. However, GWAS are often conducted on certain populations in which the Orang Asli and Malays were not included. Therefore, we have developed a bioinformatic pipeline to mine the whole-genome sequence databases of the Orang Asli and Malays to determine the presence of pathogenic SNPs that might increase the risks of cancers among them. Five different in silico tools, SIFT, PROVEAN, Poly-Phen-2, Condel, and PANTHER, were used to predict and assess the functional impacts of the SNPs. Out of the 80 cancer-related nsSNPs from the GWAS dataset, 52 nsSNPs were found among the Orang Asli and Malays. They were further analyzed using the bioinformatic pipeline to identify the pathogenic variants. Three nsSNPs; rs1126809 (TYR), rs10936600 (LRRC34), and rs757978 (FARP2), were found as the most damaging cancer pathogenic variants. These mutations alter the protein interface and change the allosteric sites of the respective proteins. As TYR, LRRC34, and FARP2 genes play important roles in numerous cellular processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, growth, and cell survival; therefore, any impairment on the protein function could be involved in the development of cancer. rs1126809, rs10936600, and rs757978 are the important pathogenic variants that increase the risks of cancers among the Orang Asli and Malays. The roles and impacts of these variants in cancers will require further investigations using in vitro cancer models.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Cluster stability was assessed with the Jaccard similarity index. We have observed 4 clusters with a very high stability (ranging between 92 and 100%). Based on distinctive features that deviate from the overall population distribution, we have labeled Cluster 1 (N = 729, 53.76%) as “Healthy”, Cluster 2 (N = 508, 37.46%) as “Family history—Overweight—High Cholesterol “, Cluster 3 (N = 91, 6.71%) as “Severe Obesity—Prediabetes—Inflammation” and Cluster 4 (N = 28, 2.06%) as “Diabetes—Hypertension—Poor CV Health”. Our work provides an in-depth characterization and thus, a better understanding of cardiometabolic health in the general population. Our data suggest that such a clustering approach could now be used to define more targeted and tailored strategies for the prevention of cardiometabolic diseases at a population level. This study provides a first step towards precision cardiometabolic prevention and should be externally validated in other contexts.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Whole blood gene expression within days after total-body irradiation predicts long term survival in Gottingen minipigs,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-95120-5,05 Aug 2021,"Gottingen minipigs mirror the physiological radiation response observed in humans and hence make an ideal candidate model for studying radiation biodosimetry for both limited-sized and mass casualty incidents. We examined the whole blood gene expression profiles starting one day after total-body irradiation with increasing doses of gamma-rays. The minipigs were monitored for up to 45 days or time to euthanasia necessitated by radiation effects. We successfully identified dose- and time-agnostic (over a 1–7 day period after radiation), survival-predictive gene expression signatures derived using machine-learning algorithms with high sensitivity and specificity. These survival-predictive signatures fare better than an optimally performing dose-differentiating signature or blood cellular profiles. These findings suggest that prediction of survival is a much more useful parameter for making triage, resource-utilization and treatment decisions in a resource-constrained environment compared to predictions of total dose received. It should hopefully be possible to build such classifiers for humans in the future.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Automated tumor proportion score analysis for PD-L1 (22C3) expression in lung squamous cell carcinoma,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-95372-1,05 Aug 2021,"Programmed cell death ligend-1 (PD-L1) expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays is a predictive marker of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy response. With the popularity of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor drugs, quantitative assessment of PD-L1 expression becomes a new labor for pathologists. Manually counting the PD-L1 positive stained tumor cells is an obviously subjective and time-consuming process. In this paper, we developed a new computer aided Automated Tumor Proportion Scoring System (ATPSS) to determine the comparability of image analysis with pathologist scores. A three-stage process was performed using both image processing and deep learning techniques to mimic the actual diagnostic flow of the pathologists. We conducted a multi-reader multi-case study to evaluate the agreement between pathologists and ATPSS. Fifty-one surgically resected lung squamous cell carcinoma were prepared and stained using the Dako PD-L1 (22C3) assay, and six pathologists with different experience levels were involved in this study. The TPS predicted by the proposed model had high and statistically significant correlation with sub-specialty pathologists’ scores with Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 8.65 (95% confidence interval (CI): 6.42–10.90) and Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) of 0.9436 (\(p < 0.001\)), and the performance on PD-L1 positive cases achieved by our method surpassed that of non-subspecialty and trainee pathologists. Those experimental results indicate that the proposed automated system can be a powerful tool to improve the PD-L1 TPS assessment of pathologists.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Deep learning for pulmonary embolism detection on computed tomography pulmonary angiogram: a systematic review and meta-analysis,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-95249-3,04 Aug 2021,"Computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is the gold standard for pulmonary embolism (PE) diagnosis. However, this diagnosis is susceptible to misdiagnosis. In this study, we aimed to perform a systematic review of current literature applying deep learning for the diagnosis of PE on CTPA. MEDLINE/PUBMED were searched for studies that reported on the accuracy of deep learning algorithms for PE on CTPA. The risk of bias was evaluated using the QUADAS-2 tool. Pooled sensitivity and specificity were calculated. Summary receiver operating characteristic curves were plotted. Seven studies met our inclusion criteria. A total of 36,847 CTPA studies were analyzed. All studies were retrospective. Five studies provided enough data to calculate summary estimates. The pooled sensitivity and specificity for PE detection were 0.88 (95% CI 0.803–0.927) and 0.86 (95% CI 0.756–0.924), respectively. Most studies had a high risk of bias. Our study suggests that deep learning models can detect PE on CTPA with satisfactory sensitivity and an acceptable number of false positive cases. Yet, these are only preliminary retrospective works, indicating the need for future research to determine the clinical impact of automated PE detection on patient care. Deep learning models are gradually being implemented in hospital systems, and it is important to understand the strengths and limitations of these algorithms.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

The best model achieved a sensitivity of 76.3%, specificity of 83.4%, and an area under curve of 0.878 (95% confidence interval, 0.855–0.899). We demonstrated that multi-dimensional deep features covering depression, anxiety, resilience, self-esteem, and clinico-demographic information contribute to the prediction of suicidal ideation.

Imputation of the continuous arterial line blood pressure waveform from non-invasive measurements using deep learning,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-94913-y,03 Aug 2021,"In two-thirds of intensive care unit (ICU) patients and 90% of surgical patients, arterial blood pressure (ABP) is monitored non-invasively but intermittently using a blood pressure cuff. Since even a few minutes of hypotension increases the risk of mortality and morbidity, for the remaining (high-risk) patients ABP is measured continuously using invasive devices, and derived values are extracted from the recorded waveforms. However, since invasive monitoring is associated with major complications (infection, bleeding, thrombosis), the ideal ABP monitor should be both non-invasive and continuous. With large volumes of high-fidelity physiological waveforms, it may be possible today to impute a physiological waveform from other available signals. Currently, the state-of-the-art approaches for ABP imputation only aim at intermittent systolic and diastolic blood pressure imputation, and there is no method that imputes the continuous ABP waveform. Here, we developed a novel approach to impute the continuous ABP waveform non-invasively using two continuously-monitored waveforms that are currently part of the standard-of-care, the electrocardiogram (ECG) and photo-plethysmogram (PPG), by adapting a deep learning architecture designed for image segmentation. Using over 150,000 min of data collected at two separate health systems from 463 patients, we demonstrate that our model provides a highly accurate prediction of the continuous ABP waveform (root mean square error 5.823 (95% CI 5.806–5.840) mmHg), as well as the derived systolic (mean difference 2.398 ± 5.623 mmHg) and diastolic blood pressure (mean difference − 2.497 ± 3.785 mmHg) compared to arterial line measurements. Our approach can potentially be used to measure blood pressure continuously and non-invasively for all patients in the acute care setting, without the need for any additional instrumentation beyond the current standard-of-care.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Automated detection of retinal exudates and drusen in ultra-widefield fundus images based on deep learning,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41433-021-01715-7,03 Aug 2021,"Retinal exudates and/or drusen (RED) can be signs of many fundus diseases that can lead to irreversible vision loss. Early detection and treatment of these diseases are critical for improving vision prognosis. However, manual RED screening on a large scale is time-consuming and labour-intensive. Here, we aim to develop and assess a deep learning system for automated detection of RED using ultra-widefield fundus (UWF) images.","We have developed and evaluated a deep learning system capable of detecting RED using UWF images obtained from multiple clinical settings. This system achieves high sensitivity and specificity, comparable to those of an experienced retina specialist. Our system has great potential to provide a timely referral for positive cases, promoting the early detection and treatment of RED-related fundus diseases. Prospective multicentre validation is expected to obtain high-level evidence for real-world application in subsequent studies.Summary
What was known before


Retinal exudates and drusen (RED) are signs of many ocular fundus diseases (e.g., uveoencephalitis, referable diabetic retinopathy [DR], and age-related macular degeneration [AMD]) that can result in irreversible vision loss. Early detection and treatment of these RED-related diseases can help reduce retinal damage and improve vision prognosis. Manual screening for RED is time-consuming and labor-intensive, and automated diagnosis systems based on traditional fundus images (30- to 60-degree visible scope of the retina) often miss RED located in the peripheral retina.


What this study adds


We developed a deep learning system to detect the RED of a variety of ocular fundus diseases from ultra-widefield fundus images (200-degree) that can provide information of almost the entire retina. This system achieves high sensitivity and specificity, comparable to an experienced retinal specialist. Due to the automation characteristics and reliable performance, our deep learning-based system has the high potential to be applied to screen for RED from UWF images as a part of ophthalmic health evaluations in physical examination centres or be applied in undeveloped areas that lack retinal specialists to provide timely referrals for cases with RED-related ocular fundus diseases, such as uveoencephalitis, referable DR, and AMD.","Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Eye tracking based dyslexia detection using a holistic approach,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-95275-1,03 Aug 2021,"A new detection method for cognitive impairments is presented utilizing an eye tracking signals in a text reading test. This research enhances published articles that extract combination of various features. It does so by processing entire eye-tracking records either in time or frequency whereas applying only basic signal pre-processing. Such signals were classified as a whole by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) that hierarchically extract substantial features scatter either in time or frequency and nonlinearly binds them using machine learning to minimize a detection error. In the experiments we used a 100 fold cross validation and a dataset containing signals of 185 subjects (88 subjects with low risk and 97 subjects with high risk of dyslexia). In a series of experiments it was found that magnitude spectrum based representation of time interpolated eye-tracking signals recorded the best results, i.e. an average accuracy of 96.6% was reached in comparison to 95.6% that is the best published result on the same database. These findings suggest that a holistic approach involving small but complex enough CNNs applied to properly pre-process and expressed signals provides even better results than a combination of meticulously selected well-known features.","We have designed, presented and analysed a novel holistic method for dyslexia detection in a text reading scenario. Unlike competing methods our system process entire signals with only minor pre-processing and two representations. This removes additional errors introduced by the feature detection-extraction methods. Furthermore, we let the machine learning represented by a CNN to learn implicit features and classify them at the same time. This is important as the usually extracted well-known features are not proven to be optimal for the detection process.In comparison to the best scoring reference method SVM-RFE16 utilizing meticulously selected combination of global features we were able on average to improve the detection process from 95.6 to 96.6% by applying a holistic approach This was achieved by a rather simple signal pre-processing, representation (magnitude spectrum) and a suitable classification model (CNN).Furthermore, our approach is between the 3 best scoring methods in terms of TPR, e.g. 97.8% compared to 97.88% as provided by SVM-RBR and SVM-linear methods. This can play a role in cases where TPR is more important than the overall performance. It is usually the case in medical diagnostics, where the misclassification of healthy patients would be less dangerous than not providing the treatment to seriously ill subjects. False negativity in this case can make it more difficult for a child to receive further education, as it will not be adequately adapted to his/her reading disorder30.The reading time is predominant and provides by itself a high accuracy, i.e. 95.67%. This was also observed in other experiments i.e. the time domain zero padded signals (have implicit reading time information, i.e. number of padded zeros) reached a high accuracy of 95.6%, whereas for the time domain interpolated signals that are stripped off any time related information the detection accuracy dropped significantly to 73.5%.As it was already mentioned, in the vast majority of cases, children with dyslexia read significantly slower than the healthy ones. However, there are still healthy children who naturally read slowly. The proposed method that uses the magnitude spectrum representation of time domain interpolated signals recorded the best accuracy, and it is obvious the time interpolation eliminates the effect of time. Thus this successful method is rather independent of the predominant reading time parameter that is observed in the dyslexia detection.Another advantage of our system is that the input to a classifier is a vector of coordinates (x-axis) and thus there is no needed for other classification/detection of events that express different eye movement types and parameters e.g. number of fixations, length of fixations or length of saccades; moreover, there is no subsequent selection and combination of such features e.g. by recursive feature elimination. It should be noted that the detection of saccades and fixations is not errorless and may introduce additional noise that can affect the accuracy.Observing the performance of our approach in relation to the complexity of CNN structures it is clear that relatively a simple structure (3–4 layers) can extract relevant information vital to classify dyslectic subjects in the text reading—eye tracking scenario.The combination of eye-tracking and text reading task proves to be very powerful for the detection of dyslexia and other disorders. Thus it would be interesting to test if this or similar holistic approach would be as successful as it is in this task. For example, applying this approach for the detection of subjects with an increased risk of developing dementia based on eye-movements during a reading activity test18. Such test could complement some comprehensive assessment of mild cognitive impairment, such as Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)31.","Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Metabolomics-based discrimination of patients with remitted depression from healthy controls using 1H-NMR spectroscopy,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-95221-1,02 Aug 2021,"The aim of the study was to investigate differences in metabolic profiles between patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) with full remission (FR) and healthy controls (HCs). A total of 119 age-matched MDD patients with FR (n = 47) and HCs (n = 72) were enrolled and randomly split into training and testing sets. A 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy-based metabolomics approach was used to identify differences in expressions of plasma metabolite biomarkers. Eight metabolites, including histidine, succinic acid, proline, acetic acid, creatine, glutamine, glycine, and pyruvic acid, were significantly differentially-expressed in the MDD patients with FR in comparison with the HCs. Metabolic pathway analysis revealed that pyruvate metabolism via the tricarboxylic acid cycle linked to amino acid metabolism was significantly associated with the MDD patients with FR. An algorithm based on these metabolites employing a linear support vector machine differentiated the MDD patients with FR from the HCs with a predictive accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of nearly 0.85. A metabolomics-based approach could effectively differentiate MDD patients with FR from HCs. Metabolomic signatures might exist long-term in MDD patients, with metabolic impacts on physical health even in patients with FR.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
A neural pathomics framework for classifying colorectal cancer histopathology images based on wavelet multi-scale texture analysis,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-94781-6,30 Jul 2021,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) constitutes the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in males and the second in females. Precise histopathological classification of CRC tissue pathology is the cornerstone not only for diagnosis but also for patients’ management decision making. An automated system able to accurately classify different CRC tissue regions may increase diagnostic precision and alleviate clinical workload. However, tissue classification is a challenging task due to the variability in morphological and textural characteristics present in histopathology images. In this study, an artificial neural network was trained to classify between eight classes of CRC tissue image patches derived from a public dataset with 5000 CRC histopathology image tiles. A total of 532 multi-level pathomics features examined at different scales were extracted by visual descriptors such as local binary patterns, wavelet transforms and Gabor filters. An exhaustive evaluation involving a variety of wavelet families and parameters was performed in order to shed light on the impact of scale on pathomics based CRC tissue differentiation. Our model achieved a performance accuracy of 95.3% with tenfold cross validation demonstrating superior performance compared to 87.4% reported in recent studies. Furthermore, we experimentally showed that the first and the second levels of the wavelet approximations can be used without compromising classification performance.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

We analysed 1.145 dietary recalls, identifying five main components that explained 81% of the dietary pattern of the sample. Dietary patterns found were: Obesogenic, represented by ultra-processed foods, processed foods, and food groups rich in carbohydrates, fats and sugars; Traditional, most influenced by natural, minimally processed foods, groups of animal proteins and beans; Intermediate was similar to the obesogenic, although there were lower loads; Vegetarian, which was the only good representation of fruits, vegetables and dairy products; and Protein, which best represented the groups of proteins (animal and vegetable). The obesogenic and intermediate patterns represented over 37% of the variation in food consumption highlighting the opportunity to improve maternal health especially for women at first mothering.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: ; Attacker Capability: 
Sociodemographic characteristics of missing data in digital phenotyping,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-94516-7,29 Jul 2021,"The ubiquity of smartphones, with their increasingly sophisticated array of sensors, presents an unprecedented opportunity for researchers to collect longitudinal, diverse, temporally-dense data about human behavior while minimizing participant burden. Researchers increasingly make use of smartphones for “digital phenotyping,” the collection and analysis of raw phone sensor and log data to study the lived experiences of subjects in their natural environments using their own devices. While digital phenotyping has shown promise in fields such as psychiatry and neuroscience, there are fundamental gaps in our knowledge about data collection and non-collection (i.e., missing data) in smartphone-based digital phenotyping. In this meta-study using individual-level data from six different studies, we examined accelerometer and GPS sensor data of 211 participants, amounting to 29,500 person-days of observation, using Bayesian hierarchical negative binomial regression with study- and user-level random intercepts. Sensitivity analyses including alternative model specification and stratified models were conducted. We found that iOS users had lower GPS non-collection than Android users. For GPS data, rates of non-collection did not differ by race/ethnicity, education, age, or gender. For accelerometer data, Black participants had higher rates of non-collection, but rates did not differ by sex, education, or age. For both sensors, non-collection increased by 0.5% to 0.9% per week. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using smartphone-based digital phenotyping across diverse populations, for extended periods of time, and within diverse cohorts.

The mean Dice similarity coefficient, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and relative area difference for the segmented lesion, measuring the similarity of clinician assessment and that of a deep neural network, were 0.97, 99.84, 96.89, 99.92, and 0.07, respectively, for the supraspinatus fossa and 0.94, 99.89, 93.34, 99.95, and 2.03, respectively, for the supraspinatus muscle. The fatty infiltration measure using the Otsu thresholding method significantly differed among the Goutallier grades (Grade 0; 0.06, Grade 1; 4.68, Grade 2; 20.10, Grade 3; 42.86, Grade 4; 55.79, p < 0.0001). The occupation ratio and fatty infiltration using Otsu thresholding demonstrated a moderate negative correlation (ρ = − 0.75, p < 0.0001). This study included 240 randomly selected patients who underwent shoulder magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) from January 2015 to December 2016.  We used a fully convolutional deep-learning algorithm to quantitatively detect the fossa and muscle regions by measuring the occupation ratio of the supraspinatus muscle. Fatty infiltration was objectively evaluated using the Otsu thresholding method. The proposed convolutional neural network exhibited fast and accurate segmentation of the supraspinatus muscle and fossa from shoulder MRI, allowing automatic calculation of the occupation ratio. Quantitative evaluation using a modified Otsu thresholding method can be used to calculate the proportion of fatty infiltration in the supraspinatus muscle. We expect that this will improve the efficiency and objectivity of diagnoses by quantifying the index used for shoulder MRI.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Using 2D video-based pose estimation for automated prediction of autism spectrum disorders in young children,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-94378-z,23 Jul 2021,"Clinical research in autism has recently witnessed promising digital phenotyping results, mainly focused on single feature extraction, such as gaze, head turn on name-calling or visual tracking of the moving object. The main drawback of these studies is the focus on relatively isolated behaviors elicited by largely controlled prompts. We recognize that while the diagnosis process understands the indexing of the specific behaviors, ASD also comes with broad impairments that often transcend single behavioral acts. For instance, the atypical nonverbal behaviors manifest through global patterns of atypical postures and movements, fewer gestures used and often decoupled from visual contact, facial affect, speech. Here, we tested the hypothesis that a deep neural network trained on the non-verbal aspects of social interaction can effectively differentiate between children with ASD and their typically developing peers. Our model achieves an accuracy of 80.9% (F1 score: 0.818; precision: 0.784; recall: 0.854) with the prediction probability positively correlated to the overall level of symptoms of autism in social affect and repetitive and restricted behaviors domain.

Predicted success rate of sleep surgery from machine learning models based on sleep parameters and endoscopic findings of upper airway demonstrated higher accuracy than subjective predicted value of sleep surgeon. The gradient boosting model showed the best performance to predict the surgical success that is evaluated by pre- and post-operative polysomnography or home sleep apnea testing among the logistic regression and three machine learning models, and the accuracy of gradient boosting model (0.708) was significantly higher than logistic regression model (0.542).

The impact of site-specific digital histology signatures on deep learning model accuracy and bias,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-24698-1,20 Jul 2021,"The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) is one of the largest biorepositories of digital histology. Deep learning (DL) models have been trained on TCGA to predict numerous features directly from histology, including survival, gene expression patterns, and driver mutations. However, we demonstrate that these features vary substantially across tissue submitting sites in TCGA for over 3,000 patients with six cancer subtypes. Additionally, we show that histologic image differences between submitting sites can easily be identified with DL. Site detection remains possible despite commonly used color normalization and augmentation methods, and we quantify the image characteristics constituting this site-specific digital histology signature. We demonstrate that these site-specific signatures lead to biased accuracy for prediction of features including survival, genomic mutations, and tumor stage. Furthermore, ethnicity can also be inferred from site-specific signatures, which must be accounted for to ensure equitable application of DL. These site-specific signatures can lead to overoptimistic estimates of model performance, and we propose a quadratic programming method that abrogates this bias by ensuring models are not trained and validated on samples from the same site.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

"Associations between dimensions of behaviour, personality traits, and mental-health during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-24365-5,16 Jul 2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic (including lockdown) is likely to have had profound but diverse implications for mental health and well-being, yet little is known about individual experiences of the pandemic (positive and negative) and how this relates to mental health and well-being, as well as other important contextual variables. Here, we analyse data sampled in a large-scale manner from 379,875 people in the United Kingdom (UK) during 2020 to identify population variables associated with mood and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to investigate self-perceived pandemic impact in relation to those variables. We report that while there are relatively small population-level differences in mood assessment scores pre- to peak-UK lockdown, the size of the differences is larger for people from specific groups, e.g. older adults and people with lower incomes. Multiple dimensions underlie peoples’ perceptions, both positive and negative, of the pandemic’s impact on daily life. These dimensions explain variance in mental health and can be statistically predicted from age, demographics, home and work circumstances, pre-existing conditions, maladaptive technology use and personality traits (e.g., compulsivity). We conclude that a holistic view, incorporating the broad range of relevant population factors, can better characterise people whose mental health is most at risk during the COVID-19 pandemic.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
A hybrid computational framework for intelligent inter-continent SARS-CoV-2 sub-strains characterization and prediction,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-93757-w,15 Jul 2021,"Whereas accelerated attention beclouded early stages of the coronavirus spread, knowledge of actual pathogenicity and origin of possible sub-strains remained unclear. By harvesting the Global initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database (https://www.gisaid.org/), between December 2019 and January 15, 2021, a total of 8864 human SARS-CoV-2 complete genome sequences processed by gender, across 6 continents (88 countries) of the world, Antarctica exempt, were analyzed. We hypothesized that data speak for itself and can discern true and explainable patterns of the disease. Identical genome diversity and pattern correlates analysis performed using a hybrid of biotechnology and machine learning methods corroborate the emergence of inter- and intra- SARS-CoV-2 sub-strains transmission and sustain an increase in sub-strains within the various continents, with nucleotide mutations dynamically varying between individuals in close association with the virus as it adapts to its host/environment. Interestingly, some viral sub-strain patterns progressively transformed into new sub-strain clusters indicating varying amino acid, and strong nucleotide association derived from same lineage. A novel cognitive approach to knowledge mining helped the discovery of transmission routes and seamless contact tracing protocol. Our classification results were better than state-of-the-art methods, indicating a more robust system for predicting emerging or new viral sub-strain(s). The results therefore offer explanations for the growing concerns about the virus and its next wave(s). A future direction of this work is a defuzzification of confusable pattern clusters for precise intra-country SARS-CoV-2 sub-strains analytics.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Sensing leg movement enhances wearable monitoring of energy expenditure,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-24173-x,13 Jul 2021,"Physical inactivity is the fourth leading cause of global mortality. Health organizations have requested a tool to objectively measure physical activity. Respirometry and doubly labeled water accurately estimate energy expenditure, but are infeasible for everyday use. Smartwatches are portable, but have significant errors. Existing wearable methods poorly estimate time-varying activity, which comprises 40% of daily steps. Here, we present a Wearable System that estimates metabolic energy expenditure in real-time during common steady-state and time-varying activities with substantially lower error than state-of-the-art methods. We perform experiments to select sensors, collect training data, and validate the Wearable System with new subjects and new conditions for walking, running, stair climbing, and biking. The Wearable System uses inertial measurement units worn on the shank and thigh as they distinguish lower-limb activity better than wrist or trunk kinematics and converge more quickly than physiological signals. When evaluated with a diverse group of new subjects, the Wearable System has a cumulative error of 13% across common activities, significantly less than 42% for a smartwatch and 44% for an activity-specific smartwatch. This approach enables accurate physical activity monitoring which could enable new energy balance systems for weight management or large-scale activity monitoring.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: ; Attacker Capability: 
Deep learning identifies antigenic determinants of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection within T-cell repertoires,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-93608-8,12 Jul 2021,"SARS-CoV-2 infection is characterized by a highly variable clinical course with patients experiencing asymptomatic infection all the way to requiring critical care support. This variation in clinical course has led physicians and scientists to study factors that may predispose certain individuals to more severe clinical presentations in hopes of either identifying these individuals early in their illness or improving their medical management. We sought to understand immunogenomic differences that may result in varied clinical outcomes through analysis of T-cell receptor sequencing (TCR-Seq) data in the open access ImmuneCODE database. We identified two cohorts within the database that had clinical outcomes data reflecting severity of illness and utilized DeepTCR, a multiple-instance deep learning repertoire classifier, to predict patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection from their repertoire sequencing. We demonstrate that patients with severe infection have repertoires with higher T-cell responses associated with SARS-CoV-2 epitopes and identify the epitopes that result in these responses. Our results provide evidence that the highly variable clinical course seen in SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated to certain antigen-specific responses.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Impact of rescanning and repositioning on radiomic features employing a multi-object phantom in magnetic resonance imaging,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-93756-x,09 Jul 2021,"Our purpose was to analyze the robustness and reproducibility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) radiomic features. We constructed a multi-object fruit phantom to perform MRI acquisition as scan-rescan using a 3 Tesla MRI scanner. We applied T2-weighted (T2w) half-Fourier acquisition single-shot turbo spin-echo (HASTE), T2w turbo spin-echo (TSE), T2w fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), T2 map and T1-weighted (T1w) TSE. Images were resampled to isotropic voxels. Fruits were segmented. The workflow was repeated by a second reader and the first reader after a pause of one month. We applied PyRadiomics to extract 107 radiomic features per fruit and sequence from seven feature classes. We calculated concordance correlation coefficients (CCC) and dynamic range (DR) to obtain measurements of feature robustness. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated to assess intra- and inter-observer reproducibility. We calculated Gini scores to test the pairwise discriminative power specific for the features and MRI sequences. We depict Bland Altmann plots of features with top discriminative power (Mann–Whitney U test). Shape features were the most robust feature class. T2 map was the most robust imaging technique (robust features (rf), n = 84). HASTE sequence led to the least amount of rf (n = 20). Intra-observer ICC was excellent (≥ 0.75) for nearly all features (max–min; 99.1–97.2%). Deterioration of ICC values was seen in the inter-observer analyses (max–min; 88.7–81.1%). Complete robustness across all sequences was found for 8 features. Shape features and T2 map yielded the highest pairwise discriminative performance. Radiomics validity depends on the MRI sequence and feature class. T2 map seems to be the most promising imaging technique with the highest feature robustness, high intra-/inter-observer reproducibility and most promising discriminative power.",Conclusions not available,Gen AI,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: ; Attacker Capability: 
"Transforming obstetric ultrasound into data science using eye tracking, voice recording, transducer motion and ultrasound video",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-92829-1,08 Jul 2021,"Ultrasound is the primary modality for obstetric imaging and is highly sonographer dependent. Long training period, insufficient recruitment and poor retention of sonographers are among the global challenges in the expansion of ultrasound use. For the past several decades, technical advancements in clinical obstetric ultrasound scanning have largely concerned improving image quality and processing speed. By contrast, sonographers have been acquiring ultrasound images in a similar fashion for several decades. The PULSE (Perception Ultrasound by Learning Sonographer Experience) project is an interdisciplinary multi-modal imaging study aiming to offer clinical sonography insights and transform the process of obstetric ultrasound acquisition and image analysis by applying deep learning to large-scale multi-modal clinical data. A key novelty of the study is that we record full-length ultrasound video with concurrent tracking of the sonographer’s eyes, voice and the transducer while performing routine obstetric scans on pregnant women. We provide a detailed description of the novel acquisition system and illustrate how our data can be used to describe clinical ultrasound. Being able to measure different sonographer actions or model tasks will lead to a better understanding of several topics including how to effectively train new sonographers, monitor the learning progress, and enhance the scanning workflow of experts.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Fuzzy rank-based fusion of CNN models using Gompertz function for screening COVID-19 CT-scans,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-93658-y,08 Jul 2021,"COVID-19 has crippled the world’s healthcare systems, setting back the economy and taking the lives of several people. Although potential vaccines are being tested and supplied around the world, it will take a long time to reach every human being, more so with new variants of the virus emerging, enforcing a lockdown-like situation on parts of the world. Thus, there is a dire need for early and accurate detection of COVID-19 to prevent the spread of the disease, even more. The current gold-standard RT-PCR test is only 71% sensitive and is a laborious test to perform, leading to the incapability of conducting the population-wide screening. To this end, in this paper, we propose an automated COVID-19 detection system that uses CT-scan images of the lungs for classifying the same into COVID and Non-COVID cases. The proposed method applies an ensemble strategy that generates fuzzy ranks of the base classification models using the Gompertz function and fuses the decision scores of the base models adaptively to make the final predictions on the test cases. Three transfer learning-based convolutional neural network models are used, namely VGG-11, Wide ResNet-50-2, and Inception v3, to generate the decision scores to be fused by the proposed ensemble model. The framework has been evaluated on two publicly available chest CT scan datasets achieving state-of-the-art performance, justifying the reliability of the model.

"A comparison of time to event analysis methods, using weight status and breast cancer as a case study",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-92944-z,07 Jul 2021,"Survival analysis with cohort study data has been traditionally performed using Cox proportional hazards models. Random survival forests (RSFs), a machine learning method, now present an alternative method. Using the UK Women’s Cohort Study (n = 34,493) we evaluate two methods: a Cox model and an RSF, to investigate the association between Body Mass Index and time to breast cancer incidence. Robustness of the models were assessed by cross validation and bootstraping. Histograms of bootstrap coefficients are reported. C-Indices and Integrated Brier Scores are reported for all models. In post-menopausal women, the Cox model Hazard Ratios (HR) for Overweight (OW) and Obese (O) were 1.25 (1.04, 1.51) and 1.28 (0.98, 1.68) respectively and the RSF Odds Ratios (OR) with partial dependence on menopause for OW and O were 1.34 (1.31, 1.70) and 1.45 (1.42, 1.48). HR are non-significant results. Only the RSF appears confident about the effect of weight status on time to event. Bootstrapping demonstrated Cox model coefficients can vary significantly, weakening interpretation potential. An RSF was used to produce partial dependence plots (PDPs) showing OW and O weight status increase the probability of breast cancer incidence in post-menopausal women. All models have relatively low C-Index and high Integrated Brier Score. The RSF overfits the data. In our study, RSF can identify complex non-proportional hazard type patterns in the data, and allow more complicated relationships to be investigated using PDPs, but it overfits limiting extrapolation of results to new instances. Moreover, it is less easily interpreted than Cox models. The value of survival analysis remains paramount and therefore machine learning techniques like RSF should be considered as another method for analysis.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Clinical characterization of dysautonomia in long COVID-19 patients,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-93546-5,07 Jul 2021,"Increasing numbers of COVID-19 patients, continue to experience symptoms months after recovering from mild cases of COVID-19. Amongst these symptoms, several are related to neurological manifestations, including fatigue, anosmia, hypogeusia, headaches and hypoxia. However, the involvement of the autonomic nervous system, expressed by a dysautonomia, which can aggregate all these neurological symptoms has not been prominently reported. Here, we hypothesize that dysautonomia, could occur in secondary COVID-19 infection, also referred to as “long COVID” infection. 39 participants were included from December 2020 to January 2021 for assessment by the Department of physical medicine to enhance their physical capabilities: 12 participants with COVID-19 diagnosis and fatigue, 15 participants with COVID-19 diagnosis without fatigue and 12 control participants without COVID-19 diagnosis and without fatigue. Heart rate variability (HRV) during a change in position is commonly measured to diagnose autonomic dysregulation. In this cohort, to reflect HRV, parasympathetic/sympathetic balance was estimated using the NOL index, a multiparameter artificial intelligence-driven index calculated from extracted physiological signals by the PMD-200 pain monitoring system. Repeated-measures mixed-models testing group effect were performed to analyze NOL index changes over time between groups. A significant NOL index dissociation over time between long COVID-19 participants with fatigue and control participants was observed (p = 0.046). A trend towards significant NOL index dissociation over time was observed between long COVID-19 participants without fatigue and control participants (p = 0.109). No difference over time was observed between the two groups of long COVID-19 participants (p = 0.904). Long COVID-19 participants with fatigue may exhibit a dysautonomia characterized by dysregulation of the HRV, that is reflected by the NOL index measurements, compared to control participants. Dysautonomia may explain the persistent symptoms observed in long COVID-19 patients, such as fatigue and hypoxia.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Impact of surgical resection of butterfly glioblastoma on survival: a meta-analysis based on comparative studies,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-93441-z,06 Jul 2021,"Butterfly glioblastoma (bGBM) is a rare brain tumor that invades both hemispheres by crossing the corpus callosum. bGBM is associated with a dismal prognosis with a median survival time of a few months. Surgical resection is a rare treatment option due to the unfavorable location and assumed poor risk-to-benefit ratio. Therefore, a biopsy-alone approach is considered the main treatment option. This meta-analysis aimed to systematically evaluate whether resection of bGBM is associated with improved overall survival compared with biopsy alone. We searched three databases to find studies that compare resection with biopsy in 6-, 12- and 18-months overall survival in patients with bGBM. We calculated the pooled relative risk (RR) of mortality using a random-effects model. Five studies with 194 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Mortality was decreased for resection compared with biopsy at 6-months (RR 0.63 [95% CI 0.44–0.91]). No significant differences in overall survival were found at 12 (RR 0.76 [95% CI 0.50–1.14]) and 18-months (RR 0.84 [95% CI 0.56–1.26]). Surgical resection of bGBM is associated with an improved 6-months overall survival compared with biopsy alone. We have not found strong evidence supporting the superiority of resection over biopsy alone in overall survival at 12 and 18-months.","Our findings suggest that surgical resection is associated with an improved 6-months survival rate in patients diagnosed with bGBM, as compared with biopsy alone. We have not found significant differences in survival rate at 12 and 18-months between resection and biopsy. In every case, an individual approach assessing the risk-to-benefit ratio of resection is necessary. There is also a need to develop new treatment strategies that will prolong survival in patients diagnosed with bGBM. Results of this meta-analysis should be interpreted with caution due to the retrospective nature of included studies. In the future, a more precise machine-learning model can be constructed to predict the impact of surgical resection of butterfly glioblastoma on survival when evaluating additional genomic and clinical information, including immune environment, genomic mutations, RNA, and protein modifications, and family history38,39.",Traditional ML,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

The consequent misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis can be fatal for patients. In this study, we trained and evaluated the performance of a vertebral body segmentation model and a vertebral compression measurement model based on convolutional neural networks. For vertebral body segmentation, we used a recurrent residual U-Net model, with an average sensitivity of 0.934 (± 0.086), an average specificity of 0.997 (± 0.002), an average accuracy of 0.987 (± 0.005), and an average dice similarity coefficient of 0.923 (± 0.073). We then generated 1134 data points on the images of three vertebral bodies by labeling each segment of the segmented vertebral body. These were used in the vertebral compression measurement model based on linear regression and multi-scale residual dilated blocks. The model yielded an average mean absolute error of 2.637 (± 1.872) (%), an average mean square error of 13.985 (± 24.107) (%), and an average root mean square error of 3.739 (± 2.187) (%) in fractured vertebral body data.

Radiomics models based on enhanced computed tomography to distinguish clear cell from non-clear cell renal cell carcinomas,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-93069-z,02 Jul 2021,"This study was to assess the effect of the predictive model for distinguishing clear cell RCC (ccRCC) from non-clear cell RCC (non-ccRCC) by establishing predictive radiomic models based on enhanced-computed tomography (CT) images of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). A total of 190 cases with RCC confirmed by pathology were retrospectively analyzed, with the patients being randomly divided into two groups, including the training set and testing set according to the ratio of 7:3. A total of 396 radiomic features were computationally obtained and analyzed with the Correlation between features, Univariate Logistics and Multivariate Logistics. Finally, 4 features were selected, and three machine models (Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression (LR)) were established to discriminate RCC subtypes. The radiomics performance was compared with that of radiologist diagnosis. In the testing set, the RF model had an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.909, a sensitivity of 0.956, and a specificity of 0.538. The SVM model had an AUC value of 0.841, a sensitivity of 1.0, and a specificity of 0.231, in the testing set. The LR model had an AUC value of 0.906, a sensitivity of 0.956, and a specificity of 0.692, in the testing set. The sensitivity and specificity of radiologist diagnosis to differentiate ccRCC from non-ccRCC were 0.850 and 0.581, respectively, with the AUC value of the radiologist diagnosis as 0.69. In conclusion, radiomics models based on CT imaging data show promise for augmenting radiological diagnosis in renal cancer, especially for differentiating ccRCC from non-ccRCC.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Cellphone enabled point-of-care assessment of breast tumor cytology and molecular HER2 expression from fine-needle aspirates,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41523-021-00290-0,02 Jul 2021,"Management of breast cancer in limited-resource settings is hindered by a lack of low-cost, logistically sustainable approaches toward molecular and cellular diagnostic pathology services that are needed to guide therapy. To address these limitations, we have developed a multimodal cellphone-based platform—the EpiView-D4—that can evaluate both cellular morphology and molecular expression of clinically relevant biomarkers directly from fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of breast tissue specimens within 1 h. The EpiView-D4 is comprised of two components: (1) an immunodiagnostic chip built upon a “non-fouling” polymer brush-coating (the “D4”) which quantifies expression of protein biomarkers directly from crude cell lysates, and (2) a custom cellphone-based optical microscope (“EpiView”) designed for imaging cytology preparations and D4 assay readout. As a proof-of-concept, we used the EpiView-D4 for assessment of human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) expression and validated the performance using cancer cell lines, animal models, and human tissue specimens. We found that FNA cytology specimens (prepared in less than 5 min with rapid staining kits) imaged by the EpiView-D4 were adequate for assessment of lesional cellularity and tumor content. We also found our device could reliably distinguish between HER2 expression levels across multiple different cell lines and animal xenografts. In a pilot study with human tissue (n = 19), we were able to accurately categorize HER2-negative and HER2-positve tumors from FNA specimens. Taken together, the EpiView-D4 offers a promising alternative to invasive—and often unavailable—pathology services and may enable the democratization of effective breast cancer management in limited-resource settings.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

The evaluation procedure included symptom monitoring, viral load and serology analysis every ten days. A total of 1334 serum samples were collected from 135 patients and analyzed using three assays for IgG-N, IgG-S and IgM antibodies. Of the study participants, 97% were seropositive during the study, and two distinct clusters were identified. These clusters were significantly different in their inflammatory related symptoms. Peak IgG-S was 40.0 AU/ml for the non-inflammatory cluster and 71.5 AU/ml for the inflammatory cluster (P = 0.006), whereas IgG-N peaks were 4.3 and 5.87 (P = 0.023) respectively. Finally, a decision tree model was designed to predict the disease phase based on the serological titer levels, and had an overall accuracy of 80.7%.

Computer-aided interpretation of chest radiography reveals the spectrum of tuberculosis in rural South Africa,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-021-00471-y,02 Jul 2021,"Computer-aided digital chest radiograph interpretation (CAD) can facilitate high-throughput screening for tuberculosis (TB), but its use in population-based active case-finding programs has been limited. In an HIV-endemic area in rural South Africa, we used a CAD algorithm (CAD4TBv5) to interpret digital chest x-rays (CXR) as part of a mobile health screening effort. Participants with TB symptoms or CAD4TBv5 score above the triaging threshold were referred for microbiological sputum assessment. During an initial pilot phase, a low CAD4TBv5 triaging threshold of 25 was selected to maximize TB case finding. We report the performance of CAD4TBv5 in screening 9,914 participants, 99 (1.0%) of whom were found to have microbiologically proven TB. CAD4TBv5 was able to identify TB cases at the same sensitivity but lower specificity as a blinded radiologist, whereas the next generation of the algorithm (CAD4TBv6) achieved comparable sensitivity and specificity to the radiologist. The CXRs of people with microbiologically confirmed TB spanned a range of lung field abnormality, including 19 (19.2%) cases deemed normal by the radiologist. HIV serostatus did not impact CAD4TB’s performance. Notably, 78.8% of the TB cases identified during this population-based survey were asymptomatic and therefore triaged for sputum collection on the basis of CAD4TBv5 score alone. While CAD4TBv6 has the potential to replace radiologists for triaging CXRs in TB prevalence surveys, population-specific piloting is necessary to set the appropriate triaging thresholds. Further work on image analysis strategies is needed to identify radiologically subtle active TB.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Optical tissue clearing and machine learning can precisely characterize extravasation and blood vessel architecture in brain tumors,https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-021-02275-y,01 Jul 2021,"Precise methods for quantifying drug accumulation in brain tissue are currently very limited, challenging the development of new therapeutics for brain disorders. Transcardial perfusion is instrumental for removing the intravascular fraction of an injected compound, thereby allowing for ex vivo assessment of extravasation into the brain. However, pathological remodeling of tissue microenvironment can affect the efficiency of transcardial perfusion, which has been largely overlooked. We show that, in contrast to healthy vasculature, transcardial perfusion cannot remove an injected compound from the tumor vasculature to a sufficient extent leading to considerable overestimation of compound extravasation. We demonstrate that 3D deep imaging of optically cleared tumor samples overcomes this limitation. We developed two machine learning-based semi-automated image analysis workflows, which provide detailed quantitative characterization of compound extravasation patterns as well as tumor angioarchitecture in large three-dimensional datasets from optically cleared samples. This methodology provides a precise and comprehensive analysis of extravasation in brain tumors and allows for correlation of extravasation patterns with specific features of the heterogeneous brain tumor vasculature.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Relevance of circulating hybrid cells as a non-invasive biomarker for myriad solid tumors,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-93053-7,01 Jul 2021,"Metastatic progression defines the final stages of tumor evolution and underlies the majority of cancer-related deaths. The heterogeneity in disseminated tumor cell populations capable of seeding and growing in distant organ sites contributes to the development of treatment resistant disease. We recently reported the identification of a novel tumor-derived cell population, circulating hybrid cells (CHCs), harboring attributes from both macrophages and neoplastic cells, including functional characteristics important to metastatic spread. These disseminated hybrids outnumber conventionally defined circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in cancer patients. It is unknown if CHCs represent a generalized cancer mechanism for cell dissemination, or if this population is relevant to the metastatic cascade. Herein, we detect CHCs in the peripheral blood of patients with cancer in myriad disease sites encompassing epithelial and non-epithelial malignancies. Further, we demonstrate that in vivo-derived hybrid cells harbor tumor-initiating capacity in murine cancer models and that CHCs from human breast cancer patients express stem cell antigens, features consistent with the potential to seed and grow at metastatic sites.

Untangling introductions and persistence in COVID-19 resurgence in Europe,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03754-2,30 Jun 2021,"After the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections in spring 2020, Europe experienced a resurgence of the virus starting in late summer 2020 that was deadlier and more difficult to contain1. Relaxed intervention measures and summer travel have been implicated as drivers of the second wave2. Here we build a phylogeographical model to evaluate how newly introduced lineages, as opposed to the rekindling of persistent lineages, contributed to the resurgence of COVID-19 in Europe. We inform this model using genomic, mobility and epidemiological data from 10 European countries and estimate that in many countries more than half of the lineages circulating in late summer resulted from new introductions since 15 June 2020. The success in onward transmission of newly introduced lineages was negatively associated with the local incidence of COVID-19 during this period. The pervasive spread of variants in summer 2020 highlights the threat of viral dissemination when restrictions are lifted, and this needs to be carefully considered in strategies to control the current spread of variants that are more transmissible and/or evade immunity. Our findings indicate that more effective and coordinated measures are required to contain the spread through cross-border travel even as vaccination is reducing disease burden.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: ; Attacker Capability: 
Influence of stroke infarct location on quality of life assessed in a multivariate lesion-symptom mapping study,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-92865-x,29 Jun 2021,"Stroke has a deleterious impact on quality of life. However, it is less well known if stroke lesions in different brain regions are associated with reduced quality of life (QoL). We therefore investigated this association by multivariate lesion-symptom mapping. We analyzed magnetic resonance imaging and clinical data from the WAKE-UP trial. European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) 3 level questionnaires were completed 90 days after stroke. Lesion symptom mapping was performed using a multivariate machine learning algorithm (support vector regression) based on stroke lesions 22–36 h after stroke. Brain regions with significant associations were explored in reference to white matter tracts. Of 503 randomized patients, 329 were included in the analysis (mean age 65.4 years, SD 11.5; median NIHSS = 6, IQR 4–9; median EQ-5D score 90 days after stroke 1, IQR 0–4, median lesion volume 3.3 ml, IQR 1.1–16.9 ml). After controlling for lesion volume, significant associations between lesions and EQ-5D score were detected for the right putamen, and internal capsules of both hemispheres. Multivariate lesion inference analysis revealed an association between injuries of the cortico-spinal tracts with worse self-reported quality of life 90 days after stroke in comparably small stroke lesions, extending previous reports of the association of striato-capsular lesions with worse functional outcome. Our findings are of value to identify patients at risk of impaired QoL after stroke.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
The amniotic fluid cell-free transcriptome in spontaneous preterm labor,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-92439-x,29 Jun 2021,"The amniotic fluid (AF) cell-free RNA was shown to reflect physiological and pathological processes in pregnancy, but its value in the prediction of spontaneous preterm delivery is unknown. Herein we profiled cell-free RNA in AF samples collected from women who underwent transabdominal amniocentesis after an episode of spontaneous preterm labor and subsequently delivered within 24 h (n = 10) or later (n = 28) in gestation. Expression of known placental single-cell RNA-Seq signatures was quantified in AF cell-free RNA and compared between the groups. Random forest models were applied to predict time-to-delivery after amniocentesis. There were 2385 genes differentially expressed in AF samples of women who delivered within 24 h of amniocentesis compared to gestational age-matched samples from women who delivered after 24 h of amniocentesis. Genes with cell-free RNA changes were associated with immune and inflammatory processes related to the onset of labor, and the expression of placental single-cell RNA-Seq signatures of immune cells was increased with imminent delivery. AF transcriptomic prediction models captured these effects and predicted delivery within 24 h of amniocentesis (AUROC = 0.81). These results may inform the development of biomarkers for spontaneous preterm birth.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Leveraging network analysis to evaluate biomedical named entity recognition tools,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-93018-w,29 Jun 2021,"The ever-growing availability of biomedical text sources has resulted in a boost in clinical studies based on their exploitation. Biomedical named-entity recognition (bio-NER) techniques have evolved remarkably in recent years and their application in research is increasingly successful. Still, the disparity of tools and the limited available validation resources are barriers preventing a wider diffusion, especially within clinical practice. We here propose the use of omics data and network analysis as an alternative for the assessment of bio-NER tools. Specifically, our method introduces quality criteria based on edge overlap and community detection. The application of these criteria to four bio-NER solutions yielded comparable results to strategies based on annotated corpora, without suffering from their limitations. Our approach can constitute a guide both for the selection of the best bio-NER tool given a specific task, and for the creation and validation of novel approaches.",Conclusions not available,Gen AI,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Deep neural network-based classification of cardiotocograms outperformed conventional algorithms,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-92805-9,28 Jun 2021,"Cardiotocography records fetal heart rates and their temporal relationship to uterine contractions. To identify high risk fetuses, obstetricians inspect cardiotocograms (CTGs) by eye. Therefore, CTG traces are often interpreted differently among obstetricians, resulting in inappropriate interventions. However, few studies have focused on quantitative and nonbiased algorithms for CTG evaluation. In this study, we propose a newly constructed deep neural network model (CTG-net) to detect compromised fetal status. CTG-net consists of three convolutional layers that extract temporal patterns and interrelationships between fetal heart rate and uterine contraction signals. We aimed to classify the abnormal group (umbilical artery pH < 7.20 or Apgar score at 1 min < 7) and the normal group from CTG data. We evaluated the performance of the CTG-net with the F1 score and compared it with conventional algorithms, namely, support vector machine and k-means clustering, and another deep neural network model, long short-term memory. CTG-net showed the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.73 ± 0.04, which was significantly higher than that of long short-term memory. CTG-net, a quantitative and automated diagnostic aid system, enables early intervention for putatively abnormal fetuses, resulting in a reduction in the number of cases of hypoxic injury.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Impact of an accelerated melting of Greenland on malaria distribution over Africa,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-24134-4,25 Jun 2021,"Studies about the impact of future climate change on diseases have mostly focused on standard Representative Concentration Pathway climate change scenarios. These scenarios do not account for the non-linear dynamics of the climate system. A rapid ice-sheet melting could occur, impacting climate and consequently societies. Here, we investigate the additional impact of a rapid ice-sheet melting of Greenland on climate and malaria transmission in Africa using several malaria models driven by Institute Pierre Simon Laplace climate simulations. Results reveal that our melting scenario could moderate the simulated increase in malaria risk over East Africa, due to cooling and drying effects, cause a largest decrease in malaria transmission risk over West Africa and drive malaria emergence in southern Africa associated with a significant southward shift of the African rain-belt. We argue that the effect of such ice-sheet melting should be investigated further in future public health and agriculture climate change risk assessments.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: ; Attacker Capability: 
Evaluating microbiome-directed fibre snacks in gnotobiotic mice and humans,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03671-4,23 Jun 2021,"Changing food preferences brought about by westernization that have deleterious health effects1,2—combined with myriad forces that are contributing to increased food insecurity—are catalysing efforts to identify more nutritious and affordable foods3. Consumption of dietary fibre can help to prevent cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and obesity4,5,6. A substantial number of reports have explored the effects of dietary fibre on the gut microbial community7,8,9. However, the microbiome is complex, dynamic and exhibits considerable intra- and interpersonal variation in its composition and functions. The large number of potential interactions between the components of the microbiome makes it challenging to define the mechanisms by which food ingredients affect community properties. Here we address the question of how foods containing different fibre preparations can be designed to alter functions associated with specific components of the microbiome. Because a marked increase in snack consumption is associated with westernization, we formulated snack prototypes using plant fibres from different sustainable sources that targeted distinct features of the gut microbiomes of individuals with obesity when transplanted into gnotobiotic mice. We used these snacks to supplement controlled diets that were consumed by adult individuals with obesity or who were overweight. Fibre-specific changes in their microbiomes were linked to changes in their plasma proteomes indicative of an altered physiological state.",Conclusions not available,Gen AI,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: ; Attacker Capability: 
New genetic variants associated with major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary syndromes and treated with clopidogrel and aspirin,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41397-021-00245-5,22 Jun 2021,"Although a few studies have reported the effects of several polymorphisms on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and those undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), these genotypes account for only a small fraction of the variation and evidence is insufficient. This study aims to identify new genetic variants associated with MACE end point during the 18-month follow-up period by a two-stage large-scale sequencing data, including high-depth whole exome sequencing of 168 patients in the discovery cohort and high-depth targeted sequencing of 1793 patients in the replication cohort. We discovered eight new genotypes and their genes associated with MACE in patients with ACS, including MYOM2 (rs17064642), WDR24 (rs11640115), NECAB1 (rs74569896), EFR3A (rs4736529), AGAP3 (rs75750968), ZDHHC3 (rs3749187), ECHS1 (rs140410716), and KRTAP10-4 (rs201441480). Notably, the expressions of MYOM2 and ECHS1 are downregulated in both animal models and patients with phenotypes related to MACE. Importantly, we developed the first superior classifier for predicting 18-month MACE and achieved high predictive performance (AUC ranged between 0.92 and 0.94 for three machine-learning methods). Our findings shed light on the pathogenesis of cardiovascular outcomes and may help the clinician to make a decision on the therapeutic intervention for ACS patients.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Machine learning enhances the performance of short and long-term mortality prediction model in non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-92362-1,18 Jun 2021,"Machine learning (ML) has been suggested to improve the performance of prediction models. Nevertheless, research on predicting the risk in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has been limited and showed inconsistency in the performance of ML models versus traditional models (TMs). This study developed ML-based models (logistic regression with regularization, random forest, support vector machine, and extreme gradient boosting) and compared their performance in predicting the short- and long-term mortality of patients with AMI with those of TMs with comparable predictors. The endpoints were the in-hospital mortality of 14,183 participants and the three- and 12-month mortality in patients who survived at discharge. The performance of the ML models in predicting the mortality of patients with an ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) was comparable to the TMs. In contrast, the areas under the curves (AUC) of the ML models for non-STEMI (NSTEMI) in predicting the in-hospital, 3-month, and 12-month mortality were 0.889, 0.849, and 0.860, respectively, which were superior to the TMs, which had corresponding AUCs of 0.873, 0.795, and 0.808. Overall, the performance of the predictive model could be improved, particularly for long-term mortality in NSTEMI, from the ML algorithm rather than using more clinical predictors.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Pain response was defined using the International Consensus Criteria. The clinical and radiomic features were extracted from medical records and pre-treatment CT images. Feature selection was performed and a random forests ensemble learning method was used to build a predictive model. Area under the curve (AUC) was used as a predictive performance metric. 69 patients were enrolled with 48 patients showing a response. Random forest models built on the radiomic, clinical, and ‘combined’ features achieved an AUC of 0.824, 0.702, 0.848, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the combined features model were 85.4% and 76.2%, at the best diagnostic decision point. We built a pain response model in patients with spinal metastases using a combination of clinical and radiomic features. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to examine pain response using pre-treatment CT radiomic features.

Recently, large-scale proteomics datasets have proven useful for predicting health-related outcomes. Here, we use measurements of levels of 4,684 plasma proteins in 22,913 Icelanders to develop all-cause mortality predictors both for short- and long-term risk. The participants were 18-101 years old with a mean follow up of 13.7 (sd. 4.7) years. During the study period, 7,061 participants died. Our proposed predictor outperformed, in survival prediction, a predictor based on conventional mortality risk factors. We could identify the 5% at highest risk in a group of 60-80 years old, where 88% died within ten years and 5% at the lowest risk where only 1% died. Furthermore, the predicted risk of death correlates with measures of frailty in an independent dataset.

We performed liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry based untargeted metabolomics on blood plasma from mothers (third trimester, n = 605; delivery, n = 558) and from the umbilical cord (n = 366). The measured metabolomes were associated to T- and B-cell subpopulations up to 4 months after delivery and to doctor´s diagnosed eczema, food allergy and asthma at one year of age using random forest analysis. Maternal and cord plasma at delivery could predict the number of CD24+CD38low memory B-cells (p = 0.033, n = 26 and p = 0.009, n = 22), but future allergy status could not be distinguished from any of the three measured metabolomes. Replication of previous literature findings showed hypoxanthine to be upregulated in the umbilical cord of children with subsequent asthma.

Identifying an effusion through the tympanic membrane is critical to diagnostic success but remains challenging due to the inherent limitations of visible light otoscopy and user interpretation. Here we describe a powerful diagnostic approach to otitis media utilizing advancements in otoscopy and machine learning. We developed an otoscope that visualizes middle ear structures and fluid in the shortwave infrared region, holding several advantages over traditional approaches. Images were captured in vivo and then processed by a novel machine learning based algorithm. The model predicts the presence of effusions with greater accuracy than current techniques, offering specificity and sensitivity over 90%.

Identification of transdiagnostic psychiatric disorder subtypes using unsupervised learning,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41386-021-01051-0,14 Jun 2021,"Psychiatric disorders show heterogeneous symptoms and trajectories, with current nosology not accurately reflecting their molecular etiology and the variability and symptomatic overlap within and between diagnostic classes. This heterogeneity impedes timely and targeted treatment. Our study aimed to identify psychiatric patient clusters that share clinical and genetic features and may profit from similar therapies. We used high-dimensional data clustering on deep clinical data to identify transdiagnostic groups in a discovery sample (N = 1250) of healthy controls and patients diagnosed with depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and other psychiatric disorders. We observed five diagnostically mixed clusters and ordered them based on severity. The least impaired cluster 0, containing most healthy controls, showed general well-being. Clusters 1–3 differed predominantly regarding levels of maltreatment, depression, daily functioning, and parental bonding. Cluster 4 contained most patients diagnosed with psychotic disorders and exhibited the highest severity in many dimensions, including medication load. Depressed patients were present in all clusters, indicating that we captured different disease stages or subtypes. We replicated all but the smallest cluster 1 in an independent sample (N = 622). Next, we analyzed genetic differences between clusters using polygenic scores (PGS) and the psychiatric family history. These genetic variables differed mainly between clusters 0 and 4 (prediction area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) = 81%; significant PGS: cross-disorder psychiatric risk, schizophrenia, and educational attainment). Our results confirm that psychiatric disorders consist of heterogeneous subtypes sharing molecular factors and symptoms.

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy coupled with machine learning classification for identification of oxidative damage in freeze-dried heart valves,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-91802-2,10 Jun 2021,"Freeze-drying can be used to ensure off-the-shelf availability of decellularized heart valves for cardiovascular surgery. In this study, decellularized porcine aortic heart valves were analyzed by nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) staining and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) to identify oxidative damage during freeze-drying and subsequent storage as well as after treatment with H2O2 and FeCl3. NBT staining revealed that sucrose at a concentration of at least 40% (w/v) is needed to prevent oxidative damage during freeze-drying. Dried specimens that were stored at 4 °C depict little to no oxidative damage during storage for up to 2 months. FTIR analysis shows that fresh control, freeze-dried and stored heart valve specimens cannot be distinguished from one another, whereas H2O2- and FeCl3-treated samples could be distinguished in some tissue section. A feed forward artificial neural network model could accurately classify H2O2 and FeCl3 treated samples. However, fresh control, freeze-dried and stored samples could not be distinguished from one another, which implies that these groups are very similar in terms of their biomolecular fingerprints. Taken together, we conclude that sucrose can minimize oxidative damage caused by freeze-drying, and that subsequent dried storage has little effects on the overall biochemical composition of heart valve scaffolds.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

We aimed to develop a machine learning methodology that identifies and provides better characterization of patient clusters at high risk of mortality and kidney injury. We analysed prospectively collected data including co-morbidities, clinical examination, and laboratory parameters from a minimally-selected population of 743 patients admitted to the ICU of a Dutch hospital between 2015 and 2017. We compared four clustering methodologies and trained a classifier to predict and validate cluster membership. The contribution of different variables to the predicted cluster membership was assessed using SHapley Additive exPlanations values. We found that deep embedded clustering yielded better results compared to the traditional clustering algorithms. The best cluster configuration was achieved for 6 clusters. All clusters were clinically recognizable, and differed in in-ICU, 30-day, and 90-day mortality, as well as incidence of acute kidney injury. We identified two high mortality risk clusters with at least 60%, 40%, and 30% increased. ICU, 30-day and 90-day mortality, and a low risk cluster with 25–56% lower mortality risk. This machine learning methodology combining deep embedded clustering and variable importance analysis, which we made publicly available, is a possible solution to challenges previously encountered by clustering analyses in heterogeneous patient populations and may help improve the characterization of risk groups in critical care.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Human immune system adaptations to simulated microgravity revealed by single-cell mass cytometry,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-90458-2,07 Jun 2021,"Exposure to microgravity (µG) during space flights produces a state of immunosuppression, leading to increased viral shedding, which could interfere with long term missions. However, the cellular mechanisms that underlie the immunosuppressive effects of µG are ill-defined. A deep understanding of human immune adaptations to µG is a necessary first step to design data-driven interventions aimed at preserving astronauts’ immune defense during short- and long-term spaceflights. We employed a high-dimensional mass cytometry approach to characterize over 250 cell-specific functional responses in 18 innate and adaptive immune cell subsets exposed to 1G or simulated (s)µG using the Rotating Wall Vessel. A statistically stringent elastic net method produced a multivariate model that accurately stratified immune responses observed in 1G and sµG (p value 2E−4, cross-validation). Aspects of our analysis resonated with prior knowledge of human immune adaptations to µG, including the dampening of Natural Killer, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses. Remarkably, we found that sµG enhanced STAT5 signaling responses of immunosuppressive Tregs. Our results suggest µG exerts a dual effect on the human immune system, simultaneously dampening cytotoxic responses while enhancing Treg function. Our study provides a single-cell readout of sµG-induced immune dysfunctions and an analytical framework for future studies of human immune adaptations to human long-term spaceflights.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: evasion; Attacker Identity: ; Attacker Capability: 
Endothelial-derived cardiovascular disease-related microRNAs elevated with prolonged sitting pattern among postmenopausal women,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-90154-1,03 Jun 2021,"Time spent sitting is positively correlated with endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular disease risk. The underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown. MicroRNAs contained in extracellular vesicles (EVs) reflect cell/tissue status and mediate intercellular communication. We explored the association between sitting patterns and microRNAs isolated from endothelial cell (EC)-derived EVs. Using extant actigraphy based sitting behavior data on a cohort of 518 postmenopausal overweight/obese women, we grouped the woman as Interrupted Sitters (IS; N = 18) or Super Sitters (SS; N = 53) if they were in the shortest or longest sitting pattern quartile, respectively. The cargo microRNA in EC-EVs from the IS and SS women were compared. MicroRNA data were weighted by age, physical functioning, MVPA, device wear days, device wear time, waist circumference, and body mass index. Screening of CVD-related microRNAs demonstrated that miR-199a-5p, let-7d-5p, miR-140-5p, miR-142-3p, miR-133b level were significantly elevated in SS compared to IS groups. Group differences in let-7d-5p, miR-133b, and miR-142-3p were validated in expanded groups. Pathway enrichment analyses show that mucin-type O-glycan biosynthesis and cardiomyocyte adrenergic signaling (P < 0.001) are downstream of the three validated microRNAs. This proof-of-concept study supports the possibility that CVD-related microRNAs in EC-EVs may be molecular transducers of sitting pattern-associated CVD risk in overweight postmenopausal women.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

We hypothesize that simultaneous hepatectomy (PHx) and PVL augments regeneration of the FLR and that the effect is related to the extent of the additional resection. Seventy-two Lewis rats were enrolled into 3 groups: 20%PVL + 70%PHx; 70%PVL + 20%PHx; 90%PVL. Animals were observed for 1, 2, 3 and 7 days postoperatively (n = 6/time point). Liver enzymes, caudate liver/body-weight-ratio, BrdU-proliferation-index (PI), proliferating-cell-nuclear-antigen (PCNA)-mRNA-expression level and autophagy-related-proteins were evaluated. Compared with 90% PVL, additional PHx induced significantly more hypertrophy during the observation time, which was confirmed by significantly higher PI and higher level of PCNA-mRNA expression. Similarly, the additional PHx induced more autophagy in the FLR compared with PVL alone. However, both effects were not clearly related to the extent of additional resection. Additional resection augmented liver regeneration and autophagy substantially compared with PVL alone. Therefore, we concluded that autophagy might play a critical role in regulating hepatocyte proliferation and the size of the FLR after simultaneous PVL + PHx.",Conclusions not available,Gen AI,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Differences in plasma microRNA content impair microRNA-based signature for breast cancer diagnosis in cohorts recruited from heterogeneous environmental sites,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-91278-0,03 Jun 2021,"Circulating microRNAs are non-invasive biomarkers that can be used for breast cancer diagnosis. However, differences in cancer tissue microRNA expression are observed in populations with different genetic/environmental backgrounds. This work aims at checking if a previously identified diagnostic circulating microRNA signature is efficient in other genetic and environmental contexts, and if a universal circulating signature might be possible. Two populations are used: women recruited in Belgium and Rwanda. Breast cancer patients and healthy controls were recruited in both populations (Belgium: 143 primary breast cancers and 136 healthy controls; Rwanda: 82 primary breast cancers and 73 healthy controls; Ntot = 434), and cohorts with matched age and cancer subtypes were compared. Plasmatic microRNA profiling was performed by RT-qPCR. Random Forest was used to (1) evaluate the performances of the previously described breast cancer diagnostic tool identified in Belgian-recruited cohorts on Rwandan-recruited cohorts and vice versa; (2) define new diagnostic signatures common to both recruitment sites; (3) define new diagnostic signatures efficient in the Rwandan population. None of the circulating microRNA signatures identified is accurate enough to be used as a diagnostic test in both populations. However, accurate circulating microRNA signatures can be found for each specific population, when taken separately.",Conclusions not available,Traditional ML,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
A deep database of medical abbreviations and acronyms for natural language processing,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-021-00929-4,02 Jun 2021,"The recognition, disambiguation, and expansion of medical abbreviations and acronyms is of upmost importance to prevent medically-dangerous misinterpretation in natural language processing. To support recognition, disambiguation, and expansion, we present the Medical Abbreviation and Acronym Meta-Inventory, a deep database of medical abbreviations. A systematic harmonization of eight source inventories across multiple healthcare specialties and settings identified 104,057 abbreviations with 170,426 corresponding senses. Automated cross-mapping of synonymous records using state-of-the-art machine learning reduced redundancy, which simplifies future application. Additional features include semi-automated quality control to remove errors. The Meta-Inventory demonstrated high completeness or coverage of abbreviations and senses in new clinical text, a substantial improvement over the next largest repository (6–14% increase in abbreviation coverage; 28–52% increase in sense coverage). To our knowledge, the Meta-Inventory is the most complete compilation of medical abbreviations and acronyms in American English to-date. The multiple sources and high coverage support application in varied specialties and settings. This allows for cross-institutional natural language processing, which previous inventories did not support.

Common neurobiological correlates of resilience and personality traits within the triple resting-state brain networks assessed by 7-Tesla ultra-high field MRI,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-91056-y,02 Jun 2021,"Despite numerous studies investigating resilience and personality trials, a paucity of information regarding their neurobiological commonalities at the level of the large resting-state networks (rsNWs) remains. Here we address this topic using the advantages of ultra-high-field (UHF) 7T-MRI, characterized by higher signal-to-noise ratio and increased sensitivity. The association between resilience, personality traits and three fMRI measures (fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF), degree centrality (DC) and regional homogeneity (ReHo)) determined for three core rsNWs (default mode (DMN), salience (SN), and central executive network (CEN)) were examined in 32 healthy volunteers. The investigation revealed a significant role of SN in both resilience and personality traits and a tight association of the DMN with resilience. DC in CEN emerged as a significant moderator for the correlations of resilience with the personality traits of neuroticism and extraversion. Our results indicate that the common neurobiological basis of resilience and the Big Five personality traits may be reflected at the level of the core rsNWs.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Portable rotating grating stimulation for anisometropic amblyopia with 6 months training,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-90936-7,01 Jun 2021,"Treatment of grating stimulation has been used in amblyopia for decades, but high dropout rate and inconvenience for daily practice occur in previous studies. We developed a home-based portable system with rotating grating stimulation on a tablet. Thirty anisometropic amblyopic children were randomly allocated into the control or Grating group. They drew contour of the picture under patch of a better eye for 6 months. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), grating acuity (GA), and contrast sensitivity (CS) were assessed at the baseline, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 6th months of training. All participants completed the 6-month training. Patched eyes of both groups exhibited no difference. Trained eyes of the control group had significantly slight improvement in BCVA and GA. In particular, the Grating group exhibited significantly higher BCVA, GA, and CS compared with those of the control group at the 3rd and 6th months of training. Moreover, percentage of the Grating group with great improvement (BCVA ≥ 0.3 or CS ≥ 0.3) was significantly larger than those of the control group at the 3rd or 6th months of training.

Differentiation between non-small cell lung cancer and radiation pneumonitis after carbon-ion radiotherapy by 18F-FDG PET/CT texture analysis,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-90674-w,01 Jun 2021,"The differentiation of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and radiation pneumonitis (RP) is critically essential for selecting optimal clinical therapeutic strategies to manage post carbon-ion radiotherapy (CIRT) in patients with NSCLC. The aim of this study was to assess the ability of 18F-FDG PET/CT metabolic parameters and its textural image features to differentiate NSCLC from RP after CIRT to develop a differential diagnosis of malignancy and benign lesion. We retrospectively analyzed 18F-FDG PET/CT image data from 32 patients with histopathologically proven NSCLC who were scheduled to undergo CIRT and 31 patients diagnosed with RP after CIRT. The SUV parameters, metabolic tumor volume (MTV), total lesion glycolysis (TLG) as well as fifty-six texture parameters derived from seven matrices were determined using PETSTAT image-analysis software. Data were statistically compared between NSCLC and RP using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Diagnostic accuracy was assessed using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves. Several texture parameters significantly differed between NSCLC and RP (p < 0.05). The parameters that were high in areas under the ROC curves (AUC) were as follows: SUVmax, 0.64; GLRLM run percentage, 0.83 and NGTDM coarseness, 0.82. Diagnostic accuracy was improved using GLRLM run percentage or NGTDM coarseness compared with SUVmax (p < 0.01). The texture parameters of 18F-FDG uptake yielded excellent outcomes for differentiating NSCLC from radiation pneumonitis after CIRT, which outperformed SUV-based evaluation. In particular, GLRLM run percentage and NGTDM coarseness of 18F-FDG PET/CT images would be appropriate parameters that can offer high diagnostic accuracy.",Conclusions not available,Gen AI,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Predictive modeling for peri-implantitis by using machine learning techniques,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-90642-4,27 May 2021,"The purpose of this retrospective cohort study was to create a model for predicting the onset of peri-implantitis by using machine learning methods and to clarify interactions between risk indicators. This study evaluated 254 implants, 127 with and 127 without peri-implantitis, from among 1408 implants with at least 4 years in function. Demographic data and parameters known to be risk factors for the development of peri-implantitis were analyzed with three models: logistic regression, support vector machines, and random forests (RF). As the results, RF had the highest performance in predicting the onset of peri-implantitis (AUC: 0.71, accuracy: 0.70, precision: 0.72, recall: 0.66, and f1-score: 0.69). The factor that had the most influence on prediction was implant functional time, followed by oral hygiene. In addition, PCR of more than 50% to 60%, smoking more than 3 cigarettes/day, KMW less than 2 mm, and the presence of less than two occlusal supports tended to be associated with an increased risk of peri-implantitis. Moreover, these risk indicators were not independent and had complex effects on each other. The results of this study suggest that peri-implantitis onset was predicted in 70% of cases, by RF which allows consideration of nonlinear relational data with complex interactions.",Conclusions not available,Traditional ML,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Predicting youth diabetes risk using NHANES data and machine learning,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-90406-0,27 May 2021,"Prediabetes and diabetes mellitus (preDM/DM) have become alarmingly prevalent among youth in recent years. However, simple questionnaire-based screening tools to reliably assess diabetes risk are only available for adults, not youth. As a first step in developing such a tool, we used a large-scale dataset from the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES) to examine the performance of a published pediatric clinical screening guideline in identifying youth with preDM/DM based on American Diabetes Association diagnostic biomarkers. We assessed the agreement between the clinical guideline and biomarker criteria using established evaluation measures (sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative predictive value, F-measure for the positive/negative preDM/DM classes, and Kappa). We also compared the performance of the guideline to those of machine learning (ML) based preDM/DM classifiers derived from the NHANES dataset. Approximately 29% of the 2858 youth in our study population had preDM/DM based on biomarker criteria. The clinical guideline had a sensitivity of 43.1% and specificity of 67.6%, positive/negative predictive values of 35.2%/74.5%, positive/negative F-measures of 38.8%/70.9%, and Kappa of 0.1 (95%CI: 0.06–0.14). The performance of the guideline varied across demographic subgroups. Some ML-based classifiers performed comparably to or better than the screening guideline, especially in identifying preDM/DM youth (p = 5.23 × 10−5).We demonstrated that a recommended pediatric clinical screening guideline did not perform well in identifying preDM/DM status among youth. Additional work is needed to develop a simple yet accurate screener for youth diabetes risk, potentially by using advanced ML methods and a wider range of clinical and behavioral health data.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
The association between four scoring systems and 30-day mortality among intensive care patients with sepsis: a cohort study,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-90806-2,27 May 2021,"Several commonly used scoring systems (SOFA, SAPS II, LODS, and SIRS) are currently lacking large sample data to confirm the predictive value of 30-day mortality from sepsis, and their clinical net benefits of predicting mortality are still inconclusive. The baseline data, LODS score, SAPS II score, SIRS score, SOFA score, and 30-day prognosis of patients who met the diagnostic criteria of sepsis were retrieved from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) intensive care unit (ICU) database. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and comparisons between the areas under the ROC curves (AUC) were conducted. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was performed to determine the net benefits between the four scoring systems and 30-day mortality of sepsis. For all cases in the cohort study, the AUC of LODS, SAPS II, SIRS, SOFA were 0.733, 0.787, 0.597, and 0.688, respectively. The differences between the scoring systems were statistically significant (all P-values < 0.0001), and stratified analyses (the elderly and non-elderly) also showed the superiority of SAPS II among the four systems. According to the DCA, the net benefit ranges in descending order were SAPS II, LODS, SOFA, and SIRS. For stratified analyses of the elderly or non-elderly groups, the results also showed that SAPS II had the most net benefit. Among the four commonly used scoring systems, the SAPS II score has the highest predictive value for 30-day mortality from sepsis, which is better than LODS, SIRS, and SOFA. The results of the DCA curves show that using the SAPS II score to predict the 30-day mortality of intensive care patients with sepsis to guide clinical applications may obtain the highest net benefit.","Among the four commonly used scoring systems, the SAPS II score has the highest predictive value for 30-day mortality from sepsis, which is better than LODS, SIRS, and SOFA.

"Space-time characterization of community noise and sound sources in Accra, Ghana",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-90454-6,27 May 2021,"Urban noise pollution is an emerging public health concern in growing cities in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), but the sound environment in SSA cities is understudied. We leveraged a large-scale measurement campaign to characterize the spatial and temporal patterns of measured sound levels and sound sources in Accra, Ghana. We measured sound levels and recorded audio clips at 146 representative locations, involving 7-days (136 locations) and 1-year measurements between 2019 and 2020. We calculated metrics of noise levels and intermittency and analyzed audio recordings using a pre-trained neural network to identify sources. Commercial, business, and industrial areas and areas near major roads had the highest median daily sound levels (LAeq24hr: 69 dBA and 72 dBA) and the lowest percentage of intermittent sound; the vice-versa was found for peri urban areas. Road-transport sounds dominated the overall sound environment but mixtures of other sound sources, including animals, human speech, and outdoor music, dominated in various locations and at different times. Environmental noise levels in Accra exceeded both international and national health-based guidelines. Detailed information on the acoustical environmental quality (including sound levels and types) in Accra may guide environmental policy formulation and evaluation to improve the health of urban residents.","Like many other SSA cities, Accra is growing rapidly amid a growing challenge of environmental pollution, including rising community noise levels. From a large-scale and comprehensive community noise measurement campaign, we characterized sound levels, patterns, and sources across the Greater Accra Metropolitan Area. The data collection and characterization approach may be applied to other cities in SSA and globally to support noise management strategies, targeted interventions, and to provide additional characterization for application to epidemiologic studies. Our results showed that sound levels in Accra largely surpassed local and international health-based guidelines. Road transport-related sources were the main contributor to community sound, though mixtures of sources were present. Stronger regulation and enforcement are needed in Accra in order to ensure that permissible limits, which are in place to safeguard public health, are met. Policy makers can also partner with traditional authorities in Accra, who play an important role in civil government, in managing community noise.","Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: ; Attacker Capability: 
Brain tumor segmentation based on deep learning and an attention mechanism using MRI multi-modalities brain images,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-90428-8,25 May 2021,"Brain tumor localization and segmentation from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are hard and important tasks for several applications in the field of medical analysis. As each brain imaging modality gives unique and key details related to each part of the tumor, many recent approaches used four modalities T1, T1c, T2, and FLAIR. Although many of them obtained a promising segmentation result on the BRATS 2018 dataset, they suffer from a complex structure that needs more time to train and test. So, in this paper, to obtain a flexible and effective brain tumor segmentation system, first, we propose a preprocessing approach to work only on a small part of the image rather than the whole part of the image. This method leads to a decrease in computing time and overcomes the overfitting problems in a Cascade Deep Learning model. In the second step, as we are dealing with a smaller part of brain images in each slice, a simple and efficient Cascade Convolutional Neural Network (C-ConvNet/C-CNN) is proposed. This C-CNN model mines both local and global features in two different routes. Also, to improve the brain tumor segmentation accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art models, a novel Distance-Wise Attention (DWA) mechanism is introduced. The DWA mechanism considers the effect of the center location of the tumor and the brain inside the model. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on the BRATS 2018 dataset and show that the proposed model obtains competitive results: the proposed method achieves a mean whole tumor, enhancing tumor, and tumor core dice scores of 0.9203, 0.9113 and 0.8726 respectively. Other quantitative and qualitative assessments are presented and discussed.","In this paper, we have developed a new brain tumor segmentation architecture that benefits from the characterization of the four MRI modalities. It means that each modality has unique characteristics to help the network efficiently distinguish between classes. We have demonstrated that working only on a part of the brain image near the tumor tissue allows a CNN model (that is the most popular deep learning architecture) to reach performance close to human observers. Moreover, a simple but efficient cascade CNN model has been proposed to extract both local and global features in two different ways with different sizes of extraction patches. In our method, after extracting the tumor’s expected area using a powerful preprocessing approach, those patches are selected to feed the network that their center is located inside this area. This leads to reducing the computational time and capability to make predictions fast for classifying the clinical image as it removes a large number of insignificant pixels off the image in the preprocessing step. Comprehensive experiments have indicated the effectiveness of the Distance-Wise Attention mechanism in our algorithm as well as the remarkable capacity of our entire model when compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.Although the proposed approach’s outstanding results compared to the other recently published models, our algorithm has still limitations when encountering tumor volume of more than one-third of the whole of the brain. This is because of an increase in the size of the tumor’s expected area which leads to a decrease in the feature extraction performance.","Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Observing deep radiomics for the classification of glioma grades,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-90555-2,25 May 2021,"Deep learning is a promising method for medical image analysis because it can automatically acquire meaningful representations from raw data. However, a technical challenge lies in the difficulty of determining which types of internal representation are associated with a specific task, because feature vectors can vary dynamically according to individual inputs. Here, based on the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of gliomas, we propose a novel method to extract a shareable set of feature vectors that encode various parts in tumor imaging phenotypes. By applying vector quantization to latent representations, features extracted by an encoder are replaced with a fixed set of feature vectors. Hence, the set of feature vectors can be used in downstream tasks as imaging markers, which we call deep radiomics. Using deep radiomics, a classifier is established using logistic regression to predict the glioma grade with 90% accuracy. We also devise an algorithm to visualize the image region encoded by each feature vector, and demonstrate that the classification model preferentially relies on feature vectors associated with the presence or absence of contrast enhancement in tumor regions. Our proposal provides a data-driven approach to enhance the understanding of the imaging appearance of gliomas.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Elastic transformation of histological slices allows precise co-registration with microCT data sets for a refined virtual histology approach,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-89841-w,25 May 2021,"Although X-ray based 3D virtual histology is an emerging tool for the analysis of biological tissue, it falls short in terms of specificity when compared to conventional histology. Thus, the aim was to establish a novel approach that combines 3D information provided by microCT with high specificity that only (immuno-)histochemistry can offer. For this purpose, we developed a software frontend, which utilises an elastic transformation technique to accurately co-register various histological and immunohistochemical stainings with free propagation phase contrast synchrotron radiation microCT. We demonstrate that the precision of the overlay of both imaging modalities is significantly improved by performing our elastic registration workflow, as evidenced by calculation of the displacement index. To illustrate the need for an elastic co-registration approach we examined specimens from a mouse model of breast cancer with injected metal-based nanoparticles. Using the elastic transformation pipeline, we were able to co-localise the nanoparticles to specifically stained cells or tissue structures into their three-dimensional anatomical context. Additionally, we performed a semi-automated tissue structure and cell classification. This workflow provides new insights on histopathological analysis by combining CT specific three-dimensional information with cell/tissue specific information provided by classical histology.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Modulation of the immune microenvironment of high-risk ductal carcinoma in situ by intralesional pembrolizumab injection,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41523-021-00267-z,25 May 2021,"Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a risk factor for the subsequent development of invasive breast cancer. High-risk features include age <45 years, size >5 cm, high-grade, palpable mass, hormone receptor negativity, and HER2 positivity. We have previously shown that immune infiltrates are positively associated with these high-risk features, suggesting that manipulating the immune microenvironment in high-risk DCIS could potentially alter disease progression. Patients with high-risk DCIS were enrolled in this 3 × 3 phase 1 dose-escalation pilot study of 2, 4, and 8 mg intralesional injections of the PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, pembrolizumab. Study participants received two intralesional injections, three weeks apart, prior to surgery. Tissue from pre-treatment biopsies and post-treatment surgical resections was analyzed using multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) staining for various immune cell populations. The intralesional injections were easily administered and well-tolerated. mIF analyses demonstrated significant increases in total T cell and CD8+ T cell percentages in most patients after receiving pembrolizumab, even at the 2 mg dose. T cell expansion was confined primarily to the stroma rather than within DCIS-containing ducts. Neither cleaved caspase 3 (CC3) staining, a marker for apoptosis, nor DCIS volume (as measured by MRI) changed significantly following treatment. Intralesional injection of pembrolizumab is safe and feasible in patients with DCIS. Nearly all patients experienced robust total and CD8+ T cell responses. However, we did not observe evidence of cell death or tumor volume decrease by MRI, suggesting that additional strategies may be needed to elicit stronger anti-tumor immunity.",Conclusions not available,Gen AI,Attack Types: evasion; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Corneal topography, pachymetry, and elevation images were obtained using anterior segment optical coherence tomography (OCT) and visual field tests were collected using standard automated perimetry with 24-2 Swedish Interactive Threshold Algorithm. The association between corneal structural parameters and visual field damage was investigated using machine learning and evaluated through tenfold cross-validation of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC). The average mean deviation was − 8.0 dB and the average central corneal thickness (CCT) was 513.1 µm. Using ensemble machine learning bagged trees classifiers, we detected visual field abnormality from corneal parameters with an AUC of 0.83. Using a tree-based machine learning classifier, we detected four visual field severity levels from corneal parameters with an AUC of 0.74.

Wearable sensors enable personalized predictions of clinical laboratory measurements,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01339-0,24 May 2021,"Vital signs, including heart rate and body temperature, are useful in detecting or monitoring medical conditions, but are typically measured in the clinic and require follow-up laboratory testing for more definitive diagnoses. Here we examined whether vital signs as measured by consumer wearable devices (that is, continuously monitored heart rate, body temperature, electrodermal activity and movement) can predict clinical laboratory test results using machine learning models, including random forest and Lasso models. Our results demonstrate that vital sign data collected from wearables give a more consistent and precise depiction of resting heart rate than do measurements taken in the clinic. Vital sign data collected from wearables can also predict several clinical laboratory measurements with lower prediction error than predictions made using clinically obtained vital sign measurements. The length of time over which vital signs are monitored and the proximity of the monitoring period to the date of prediction play a critical role in the performance of the machine learning models. These results demonstrate the value of commercial wearable devices for continuous and longitudinal assessment of physiological measurements that today can be measured only with clinical laboratory tests.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

We show that ensemble-based models perform better than other model types at predicting both 5-day ICU admission and 28-day mortality from COVID-19. CRP, LDH, and O2 saturation were important for ICU admission models whereas eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2, and neutrophil and lymphocyte percentages were the most important variables for predicting mortality.

However, developing methods to recover information encoded in these signals is a significant challenge. Our goal was to test the feasibility of measuring physiologically generated nerve action potentials that can be classified as sensory or motor signals. A tetrapolar recording nerve cuff electrode was used to measure vagal nerve (VN) activity in a rodent model of upper airway obstruction. The effect of upper airway occlusions on VN activity related to respiration (RnP) was calculated and compared for 4 different cases: (1) intact VN, (2) VN transection only proximal to recording electrode, (3) VN transection only distal to the recording electrode, and (4) transection of VN proximal and distal to electrode. We employed a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model with Gaussian Kernel to learn a model capable of classifying efferent and afferent waveforms obtained from the tetrapolar electrode. In vivo results showed that the RnP values decreased significantly during obstruction by 91.7% ± 3.1%, and 78.2% ± 3.4% for cases of intact VN or proximal transection, respectively. In contrast, there were no significant changes for cases of VN transection at the distal end or both ends of the electrode. The SVM model yielded an 85.8% accuracy in distinguishing motor and sensory signals. The feasibility of measuring low-noise directionally-sensitive neural activity using a tetrapolar nerve cuff electrode along with the use of an SVM classifier was shown.

We have undertaken a comprehensive investigation of the underlying primary structural features that give rise to the development of activity in AMPs. We consider a complete set of all possible peptides, up to 7 residues long, composed of positively charged arginine (R) and / or hydrophobic tryptophan (W), two features most commonly associated with activity. We found the shortest active peptides were 4 or 5 residues in length, and the overall landscapes of activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and a yeast were positively correlated. For all three organisms we found a single activity peak corresponding to sequences with around 40% R; the presence of adjacent W duplets and triplets also conferred greater activity. The mechanistic basis of these activities comprises a combination of lipid binding, particularly to negatively charged membranes, and additionally peptide aggregation, a mode of action previously uninvestigated for such peptides. The maximum specific antimicrobial activity appeared to occur in peptides of around 10 residues, suggesting ‘diminishing returns’ for developing larger peptides, when activity is considered per residue of peptide.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: ; Attacker Capability: 
Analysing wideband absorbance immittance in normal and ears with otitis media with effusion using machine learning,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-89588-4,20 May 2021,"Wideband Absorbance Immittance (WAI) has been available for more than a decade, however its clinical use still faces the challenges of limited understanding and poor interpretation of WAI results. This study aimed to develop Machine Learning (ML) tools to identify the WAI absorbance characteristics across different frequency-pressure regions in the normal middle ear and ears with otitis media with effusion (OME) to enable diagnosis of middle ear conditions automatically. Data analysis included pre-processing of the WAI data, statistical analysis and classification model development, and key regions extraction from the 2D frequency-pressure WAI images. The experimental results show that ML tools appear to hold great potential for the automated diagnosis of middle ear diseases from WAI data. The identified key regions in the WAI provide guidance to practitioners to better understand and interpret WAI data and offer the prospect of quick and accurate diagnostic decisions.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI","Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient, healthcare practitioner; Attacker Capability: "
Med-BERT: pretrained contextualized embeddings on large-scale structured electronic health records for disease prediction,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-021-00455-y,20 May 2021,"Deep learning (DL)-based predictive models from electronic health records (EHRs) deliver impressive performance in many clinical tasks. Large training cohorts, however, are often required by these models to achieve high accuracy, hindering the adoption of DL-based models in scenarios with limited training data. Recently, bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) and related models have achieved tremendous successes in the natural language processing domain. The pretraining of BERT on a very large training corpus generates contextualized embeddings that can boost the performance of models trained on smaller datasets. Inspired by BERT, we propose Med-BERT, which adapts the BERT framework originally developed for the text domain to the structured EHR domain. Med-BERT is a contextualized embedding model pretrained on a structured EHR dataset of 28,490,650 patients. Fine-tuning experiments showed that Med-BERT substantially improves the prediction accuracy, boosting the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) by 1.21–6.14% in two disease prediction tasks from two clinical databases. In particular, pretrained Med-BERT obtains promising performances on tasks with small fine-tuning training sets and can boost the AUC by more than 20% or obtain an AUC as high as a model trained on a training set ten times larger, compared with deep learning models without Med-BERT. We believe that Med-BERT will benefit disease prediction studies with small local training datasets, reduce data collection expenses, and accelerate the pace of artificial intelligence aided healthcare.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
3D free-hand ultrasound to register anatomical landmarks at the pelvis and localize the hip joint center in lean and obese individuals,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-89763-7,20 May 2021,"3D free-hand ultrasound (3DFUS) is becoming increasingly popular to assist clinical gait analysis because it is cost- and time-efficient and does not expose participants to radiation. The aim of this study was to evaluate its reliability in localizing the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) at the pelvis and the hip joint centers (HJC). Additionally, we evaluated its accuracy to get a rough estimation of the potential to use of 3DFUS to segment bony surface. This could offer potential to register medical images to motion capture data in future. To evaluate reliability, a test–retest study was conducted in 16 lean and 19 obese individuals. The locations of the ASIS were determined by manual marker placement (MMP), an instrumented pointer technique (IPT), and with 3DFUS. The HJC location was also determined with 3DFUS. To quantify reliability, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), the standard error of measurement (SEm), among other statistical parameters, were calculated for the identified locations between the test and retest. To assess accuracy, the surface of a human plastic pelvic phantom was segmented with 3DFUS in a distilled water bath in 27 trials and compared to a 3D laser scan of the pelvis. Regarding reliability, the MMP, but especially the IPT showed high reliability in lean (SEm: 2–3 mm) and reduced reliability in obese individuals (SEm: 6–15 mm). Compared to MMP and IPT, 3DFUS presented lower reliability in the lean group (SEm: 2–4 mm vs. 2–8 mm, respectively) but slightly better values in the obese group (SEm: 7–11 mm vs. 6–16 mm, respectively). Correlations between test–retest reliability and torso body fat mass (% of body mass) indicated a moderate to strong relationship for MMP and IPT but only a weak correlation for the 3DFUS approach. The water-bath experiments indicated an acceptable level of 3.5 (1.7) mm of accuracy for 3DFUS in segmenting bone surface. Despite some difficulties with single trials, our data give further rise to the idea that 3DFUS could serve as a promising tool in future to inform marker placement and hip joint center location, especially in groups with higher amount of body fat.",Conclusions not available,Traditional ML,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Feasibility of predicting allele specific expression from DNA sequencing using machine learning,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-89904-y,19 May 2021,"Allele specific expression (ASE) concerns divergent expression quantity of alternative alleles and is measured by RNA sequencing. Multiple studies show that ASE plays a role in hereditary diseases by modulating penetrance or phenotype severity. However, genome diagnostics is based on DNA sequencing and therefore neglects gene expression regulation such as ASE. To take advantage of ASE in absence of RNA sequencing, it must be predicted using only DNA variation. We have constructed ASE models from BIOS (n = 3432) and GTEx (n = 369) that predict ASE using DNA features. These models are highly reproducible and comprise many different feature types, highlighting the complex regulation that underlies ASE. We applied the BIOS-trained model to population variants in three genes in which ASE plays a clinically relevant role: BRCA2, RET and NF1. This resulted in predicted ASE effects for 27 variants, of which 10 were known pathogenic variants. We demonstrated that ASE can be predicted from DNA features using machine learning. Future efforts may improve sensitivity and translate these models into a new type of genome diagnostic tool that prioritizes candidate pathogenic variants or regulators thereof for follow-up validation by RNA sequencing. All used code and machine learning models are available at GitHub and Zenodo.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Probing an AI regression model for hand bone age determination using gradient-based saliency mapping,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-90157-y,19 May 2021,"Understanding how a neural network makes decisions holds significant value for users. For this reason, gradient-based saliency mapping was tested on an artificial intelligence (AI) regression model for determining hand bone age from X-ray radiographs. The partial derivative (PD) of the inferred age with respect to input image intensity at each pixel served as a saliency marker to find sensitive areas contributing to the outcome. The mean of the absolute PD values was calculated for five anatomical regions of interest, and one hundred test images were evaluated with this procedure. The PD maps suggested that the AI model employed a holistic approach in determining hand bone age, with the wrist area being the most important at early ages. However, this importance decreased with increasing age. The middle section of the metacarpal bones was the least important area for bone age determination. The muscular region between the first and second metacarpal bones also exhibited high PD values but contained no bone age information, suggesting a region of vulnerability in age determination. An end-to-end gradient-based saliency map can be obtained from a black box regression AI model and provide insight into how the model makes decisions.","A gradient-based saliency map is useful for providing insights into how a regression AI model makes decisions. The map can be readily calculated by treating the model as a complete black box. When used with other investigation tools, this method may be useful for identifying areas of importance and unimportance for the task.","Traditional ML, DNN",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: ; Attacker Capability: 
Survival prediction and treatment optimization of multiple myeloma patients using machine-learning models based on clinical and gene expression data,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41375-021-01286-2,18 May 2021,"Multiple myeloma (MM) remains mostly an incurable disease with a heterogeneous clinical evolution. Despite the availability of several prognostic scores, substantial room for improvement still exists. Promising results have been obtained by integrating clinical and biochemical data with gene expression profiling (GEP). In this report, we applied machine learning algorithms to MM clinical and RNAseq data collected by the CoMMpass consortium. We created a 50-variable random forests model (IAC-50) that could predict overall survival with high concordance between both training and validation sets (c-indexes, 0.818 and 0.780). This model included the following covariates: patient age, ISS stage, serum B2-microglobulin, first-line treatment, and the expression of 46 genes. Survival predictions for each patient considering the first line of treatment evidenced that those individuals treated with the best-predicted drug combination were significantly less likely to die than patients treated with other schemes. This was particularly important among patients treated with a triplet combination including bortezomib, an immunomodulatory drug (ImiD), and dexamethasone. Finally, the model showed a trend to retain its predictive value in patients with high-risk cytogenetics. In conclusion, we report a predictive model for MM survival based on the integration of clinical, biochemical, and gene expression data with machine learning tools.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Early bradycardia detection and therapeutic interventions in preterm infant monitoring,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-89468-x,18 May 2021,"In very preterm infants, cardio-respiratory events and associated hypoxemia occurring during early postnatal life have been associated with risks of retinopathy, growth alteration and neurodevelopment impairment. These events are commonly detected by continuous cardio-respiratory monitoring in neonatal intensive care units (NICU), through the associated bradycardia. NICU nurse interventions are mainly triggered by these alarms. In this work, we acquired data from 52 preterm infants during NICU monitoring, in order to propose an early bradycardia detector which is based on a decentralized fusion of three detectors. The main objective is to improve automatic detection under real-life conditions without altering performance with respect to that of a monitor commonly used in NICU. We used heart rate lower than 80 bpm during at least 10 sec to define bradycardia. With this definition we observed a high rate of false alarms (64%) in real-life and that 29% of the relevant alarms were not followed by manual interventions. Concerning the proposed detection method, when compared to current monitors, it provided a significant decrease of the detection delay of 2.9 seconds, without alteration of the sensitivity (97.6% vs 95.2%) and false alarm rate (63.7% vs 64.1%). We expect that such an early detection will improve the response of the newborn to the intervention and allow for the development of new automatic therapeutic strategies which could complement manual intervention and decrease the sepsis risk.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Fast and accurate automated recognition of the dominant cells from fecal images based on Faster R-CNN,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-89863-4,14 May 2021,"Fecal samples can easily be collected and are representative of a person’s current health state; therefore, the demand for routine fecal examination has increased sharply. However, manual operation may pollute the samples, and low efficiency limits the general examination speed; therefore, automatic analysis is needed. Nevertheless, recognition exhaustion time and accuracy remain major challenges in automatic testing. Here, we introduce a fast and efficient cell-detection algorithm based on the Faster-R-CNN technique: the Resnet-152 convolutional neural network architecture. Additionally, a region proposal network and a network combined with principal component analysis are proposed for cell location and recognition in microscopic images. Our algorithm achieved a mean average precision of 84% and a 723 ms detection time per sample for 40,560 fecal images.

Predictive SNPs for β0-thalassemia/HbE disease severity,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-89641-2,14 May 2021,"β-Thalassemia/HbE disease has a wide spectrum of clinical phenotypes ranging from asymptomatic to dependent on regular blood transfusions. Ability to predict disease severity is helpful for clinical management and treatment decision making. A thalassemia severity score has been developed from Mediterranean β-thalassemia patients. However, different ethnic groups may have different allele frequency and linkage disequilibrium structures. Here, Thai β0-thalassemia/HbE disease genome-wild association studies (GWAS) data of 487 patients were analyzed by SNP interaction prioritization algorithm, interacting Loci (iLoci), to find predictive SNPs for disease severity. Three SNPs from two SNP interaction pairs associated with disease severity were identifies. The three-SNP disease severity risk score composed of rs766432 in BCL11A, rs9399137 in HBS1L-MYB and rs72872548 in HBE1 showed more than 85% specificity and 75% accuracy. The three-SNP predictive score was then validated in two independent cohorts of Thai and Malaysian β0-thalassemia/HbE patients with comparable specificity and accuracy.

Fetal screening ultrasound provides five views of the heart that together can detect 90% of complex CHD, but in practice, sensitivity is as low as 30%. Here, using 107,823 images from 1,326 retrospective echocardiograms and screening ultrasounds from 18- to 24-week fetuses, we trained an ensemble of neural networks to identify recommended cardiac views and distinguish between normal hearts and complex CHD. We also used segmentation models to calculate standard fetal cardiothoracic measurements. In an internal test set of 4,108 fetal surveys (0.9% CHD, >4.4 million images), the model achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.99, 95% sensitivity (95% confidence interval (CI), 84–99%), 96% specificity (95% CI, 95–97%) and 100% negative predictive value in distinguishing normal from abnormal hearts. Model sensitivity was comparable to that of clinicians and remained robust on outside-hospital and lower-quality images. The model’s decisions were based on clinically relevant features. Cardiac measurements correlated with reported measures for normal and abnormal hearts. Applied to guideline-recommended imaging, ensemble learning models could significantly improve detection of fetal CHD, a critical and global diagnostic challenge.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Large-scale plasma proteomic analysis identifies proteins and pathways associated with dementia risk,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-021-00064-0,14 May 2021,"The plasma proteomic changes that precede the onset of dementia could yield insights into disease biology and highlight new biomarkers and avenues for intervention. We quantified 4,877 plasma proteins in nondemented older adults in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities cohort and performed a proteome-wide association study of dementia risk over five years (n = 4,110; 428 incident cases). Thirty-eight proteins were associated with incident dementia after Bonferroni correction. Of these, 16 were also associated with late-life dementia risk when measured in plasma collected nearly 20 years earlier, during mid-life. Two-sample Mendelian randomization causally implicated two dementia-associated proteins (SVEP1 and angiostatin) in Alzheimer’s disease. SVEP1, an immunologically relevant cellular adhesion protein, was found to be part of larger dementia-associated protein networks, and circulating levels were associated with atrophy in brain regions vulnerable to Alzheimer’s pathology. Pathway analyses for the broader set of dementia-associated proteins implicated immune, lipid, metabolic signaling and hemostasis pathways in dementia pathogenesis.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Enhancement of cerebrovascular 4D flow MRI velocity fields using machine learning and computational fluid dynamics simulation data,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-89636-z,13 May 2021,"Blood flow metrics obtained with four-dimensional (4D) flow phase contrast (PC) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be of great value in clinical and experimental cerebrovascular analysis. However, limitations in both quantitative and qualitative analyses can result from errors inherent to PC MRI. One method that excels in creating low-error, physics-based, velocity fields is computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Augmentation of cerebral 4D flow MRI data with CFD-informed neural networks may provide a method to produce highly accurate physiological flow fields. In this preliminary study, the potential utility of such a method was demonstrated by using high resolution patient-specific CFD data to train a convolutional neural network, and then using the trained network to enhance MRI-derived velocity fields in cerebral blood vessel data sets. Through testing on simulated images, phantom data, and cerebrovascular 4D flow data from 20 patients, the trained network successfully de-noised flow images, decreased velocity error, and enhanced near-vessel-wall velocity quantification and visualization. Such image enhancement can improve experimental and clinical qualitative and quantitative cerebrovascular PC MRI analysis.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Predicting sex from retinal fundus photographs using automated deep learning,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-89743-x,13 May 2021,"Deep learning may transform health care, but model development has largely been dependent on availability of advanced technical expertise. Herein we present the development of a deep learning model by clinicians without coding, which predicts reported sex from retinal fundus photographs. A model was trained on 84,743 retinal fundus photos from the UK Biobank dataset. External validation was performed on 252 fundus photos from a tertiary ophthalmic referral center. For internal validation, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of the code free deep learning (CFDL) model was 0.93. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and accuracy (ACC) were 88.8%, 83.6%, 87.3% and 86.5%, and for external validation were 83.9%, 72.2%, 78.2% and 78.6% respectively.

Artificial intelligence in detecting temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis on orthopantomogram,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-89742-y,13 May 2021,"Orthopantomogram (OPG) is important for primary diagnosis of temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis (TMJOA), because of cost and the radiation associated with computed tomograms (CT). The aims of this study were to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) model and compare its TMJOA diagnostic performance from OPGs with that of an oromaxillofacial radiology (OMFR) expert. An AI model was developed using Karas’ ResNet model and trained to classify images into three categories: normal, indeterminate OA, and OA. This study included 1189 OPG images confirmed by cone-beam CT and evaluated the results by model (accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score) and diagnostic performance (accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity). The model performance was unsatisfying when AI was developed with 3 categories. After the indeterminate OA images were reclassified as normal, OA, or omission, the AI diagnosed TMJOA in a similar manner to an expert and was in most accord with CBCT when the indeterminate OA category was omitted (accuracy: 0.78, sensitivity: 0.73, and specificity: 0.82). Our deep learning model showed a sensitivity equivalent to that of an expert, with a better balance between sensitivity and specificity, which implies that AI can play an important role in primary diagnosis of TMJOA from OPGs in most general practice clinics where OMFR experts or CT are not available.","Collectively, an AI may read OPGs to diagnose TMJOA as well as OMFR experts can with respect to sensitivity and has greater accordance with CBCT interpretations than do OMFR experts, which implies that AI can play an important role in diagnosing TMJOA primarily from OPGs in most general practice clinics, where OMFR experts or CBCT are not available.","Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

To address this a genomic tradeoff hypothesis was tested and followed up with the biological interaction and evolutionary significance of positively selected ASD risk genes. SFARI database was used to retrieve the ASD risk genes while for population datasets 1000 genome data was used. Common risk SNPs were subjected to machine learning as well as independent tests for selection, followed by Bayesian analysis to identify the cumulative effect of selection on risk SNPs. Functional implication of these positively selected risk SNPs was assessed and subjected to ontology analysis, pertaining to their interaction and enrichment of biological and cellular functions. This was followed by comparative analysis with the ancient genomes to identify their evolutionary patterns. Our results identified significant positive selection signals in 18 ASD risk SNPs. Functional and ontology analysis indicate the role of biological and cellular processes associated with various brain functions. The core of the biological interaction network constitutes genes for cognition and learning while genes in the periphery of the network had direct or indirect impact on brain function. Ancient genome analysis identified de novo and conserved evolutionary selection clusters. The de-novo evolutionary cluster represented genes involved in cognitive function. Relative enrichment of the ASD risk SNPs from the respective evolutionary cluster or biological interaction networks may help in addressing the phenotypic diversity in ASD.

Here we investigate the ability of NIRS to identify Plasmodium falciparum in Anopheles coluzzii mosquitoes. NIRS models trained on laboratory-reared mosquitoes infected with wild malaria parasites can detect the parasite in comparable mosquitoes with moderate accuracy though fails to detect oocysts or sporozoites in naturally infected field caught mosquitoes. Models trained on field mosquitoes were unable to predict the infection status of other field mosquitoes. Restricting analyses to mosquitoes of uninfectious and highly-infectious status did improve predictions suggesting sensitivity and specificity may be better in mosquitoes with higher numbers of parasites.

Serum metabolic biomarkers for synucleinopathy conversion in isolated REM sleep behavior disorder,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41531-021-00184-9,13 May 2021,"Isolated rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) is a prodromal stage of Lewy-type synucleinopathies (LTS), which can present either with an initial predominant parkinsonism (Parkinson’s disease (PD)) or dementia (dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB)). To provide insights into the underlying pathogenic mechanisms, the lipoprotein and protein glycosylation profile of 82 iRBD patients, collected before and/or after their conversion to an overt LTS, and 29 matched control serum samples were assessed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Data were statistically analyzed to identify altered metabolites and construct predictive models. Univariant analysis detected no differences between iRBD patients with an LTS compared to controls. However, significant differences were found when the analysis distinguished between iRBD patients that manifested initially predominant parkinsonism (pre-PD) or dementia (pre-DLB). Significant differences were also found in the analysis of paired iRBD samples pre- and post-LTS diagnosis. Predictive models were built and distinguished between controls and pre-DLB patients, and between pre-DLB and pre-PD patients. This allowed a prediction of the possible future clinical outcome of iRBD patients. We provide evidence of altered lipoprotein and glycosylation profiles in subgroups of iRBD patients. Our results indicate that metabolic alterations and inflammation are involved in iRBD pathophysiology, and suggest biological differences underlying the progression of LTS in iRBD patients. Our data also indicate that profiling of serum samples by NMR may be a useful tool for identifying short-term high-risk iRBD patients for conversion to parkinsonism or dementia.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Noninvasive transcranial classification of stroke using a portable eddy current damping sensor,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-89735-x,13 May 2021,"Existing paradigms for stroke diagnosis typically involve computed tomography (CT) imaging to classify ischemic versus hemorrhagic stroke variants, as treatment for these subtypes varies widely. Delays in diagnosis and transport of unstable patients may worsen neurological status. To address these issues, we describe the development of a rapid, portable, and accurate eddy current damping (ECD) stroke sensor. Copper wire was wound to create large (11.4 cm), medium (4.5 cm), and small (1.5 cm) solenoid coils with varying diameters, with each connected to an inductance-to-digital converter. Eight human participants were recruited between December 15, 2019 and March 15, 2020, including two hemorrhagic stroke, two ischemic stroke, one subarachnoid hemorrhage, and three control participants. Observers were blinded to lesion type and location. A head cap with 8 horizontal scanning paths was placed on the patient. The sensor was tangentially rotated across each row on the patient’s head circumferentially. Consent, positioning, and scanning with the sensor took roughly 15 min from start to end for each participant and all scanning took place at the patient bedside. The ECD sensor accurately classified and imaged each of the varying stroke types in each patient. The sensor additionally detected ischemic and hemorrhagic lesions located deep inside the brain, and its range is selectively tunable during sensor design and fabrication.","We demonstrated feasibility of rapid and accurate bedside stroke detection using handheld ECD sensors in live human clinical ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke settings. We show that diagnosis of stroke may potentially be reduced from several hours to minutes, with additional spatial localization of intracranial hemorrhage or infarct. The sensor additionally detects ischemic and hemorrhagic lesions located deep inside the brain, and its range can be selectively tuned during sensor design and fabrication through the use of various sized coils. Further research is warranted to optimize the sensor for millimeter and sub-millimeter lesion detection to accurately and confidently guide clinical intervention.",Gen AI,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Random forest-based prediction of stroke outcome,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-89434-7,12 May 2021,"We research into the clinical, biochemical and neuroimaging factors associated with the outcome of stroke patients to generate a predictive model using machine learning techniques for prediction of mortality and morbidity 3-months after admission. The dataset consisted of patients with ischemic stroke (IS) and non-traumatic intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) admitted to Stroke Unit of a European Tertiary Hospital prospectively registered. We identified the main variables for machine learning Random Forest (RF), generating a predictive model that can estimate patient mortality/morbidity according to the following groups: (1) IS + ICH, (2) IS, and (3) ICH. A total of 6022 patients were included: 4922 (mean age 71.9 ± 13.8 years) with IS and 1100 (mean age 73.3 ± 13.1 years) with ICH. NIHSS at 24, 48 h and axillary temperature at admission were the most important variables to consider for evolution of patients at 3-months. IS + ICH group was the most stable for mortality prediction [0.904 ± 0.025 of area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC)]. IS group presented similar results, although variability between experiments was slightly higher (0.909 ± 0.032 of AUC). ICH group was the one in which RF had more problems to make adequate predictions (0.9837 vs. 0.7104 of AUC). There were no major differences between IS and IS + ICH groups according to morbidity prediction (0.738 and 0.755 of AUC) but, after checking normality with a Shapiro Wilk test with the null hypothesis that the data follow a normal distribution, it was rejected with W = 0.93546 (p-value < 2.2e−16). Conditions required for a parametric test do not hold, and we performed a paired Wilcoxon Test assuming the null hypothesis that all the groups have the same performance. The null hypothesis was rejected with a value < 2.2e−16, so there are statistical differences between IS and ICH groups. In conclusion, machine learning algorithms RF can be effectively used in stroke patients for long-term outcome prediction of mortality and morbidity.","Machine learning algorithms, particularly Random Forest, can be effectively used in long-term outcome prediction of mortality and morbidity of stroke patients.

We hypothesized that machine learning-based classifiers can reliably distinguish the CXR images of COVID-19 patients from other forms of pneumonia. We used a dimensionality reduction method to generate a set of optimal features of CXR images to build an efficient machine learning classifier that can distinguish COVID-19 cases from non-COVID-19 cases with high accuracy and sensitivity. By using global features of the whole CXR images, we successfully implemented our classifier using a relatively small dataset of CXR images.

This study proposes a novel machine learning algorithm to detect an age-specific movement pattern, the fidgety movements (FMs), in a prospectively collected sample of typically developing infants. Participants were recorded using a passive, single camera RGB video stream. The dataset of 2800 five-second snippets was annotated by two well-trained and experienced GMA assessors, with excellent inter- and intra-rater reliabilities. Using OpenPose, the infant full pose was recovered from the video stream in the form of a 25-points skeleton. This skeleton was used as input vector for a shallow multilayer neural network (SMNN). An ablation study was performed to justify the network’s architecture and hyperparameters. We show for the first time that the SMNN is sufficient to discriminate fidgety from non-fidgety movements in a sample of age-specific typical movements with a classification accuracy of 88%. The computer-based solutions will complement original GMA to consistently perform accurate and efficient screening and diagnosis that may become universally accessible in daily clinical practice in the future.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: ; Attacker Capability: 
Environmental determinants of COVID-19 transmission across a wide climatic gradient in Chile,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-89213-4,10 May 2021,"Several studies have examined the transmission dynamics of the novel COVID-19 disease in different parts of the world. Some have reported relationships with various environmental variables, suggesting that spread of the disease is enhanced in colder and drier climates. However, evidence is still scarce and mostly limited to a few countries, particularly from Asia. We examined the potential role of multiple environmental variables in COVID-19 infection rate [measured as mean relative infection rate = (number of infected inhabitants per week / total population) × 100.000) from February 23 to August 16, 2020 across 360 cities of Chile. Chile has a large climatic gradient (≈ 40º of latitude, ≈ 4000 m of altitude and 5 climatic zones, from desert to tundra), but all cities share their social behaviour patterns and regulations. Our results indicated that COVID-19 transmission in Chile was mostly related to three main climatic factors (minimum temperature, atmospheric pressure and relative humidity). Transmission was greater in colder and drier cities and when atmospheric pressure was lower. The results of this study support some previous findings about the main climatic determinants of COVID-19 transmission, which may be useful for decision-making and management of the disease.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: ; Attacker Capability: 
Validation of a DKK1 RNAscope chromogenic in situ hybridization assay for gastric and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma tumors,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-89060-3,10 May 2021,"Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) is a secreted modulator of Wnt signaling that is frequently overexpressed in tumors and associated with poor clinical outcomes. DKN-01 is a humanized monoclonal therapeutic antibody that binds DKK1 with high affinity and has demonstrated clinical activity in gastric/gastroesophageal junction (G/GEJ) patients with elevated tumoral expression of DKK1. Here we report on the validation of a DKK1 RNAscope chromogenic in situ hybridization assay to assess DKK1 expression in G/GEJ tumor tissue. To reduce pathologist time, potential pathologist variability from manual scoring and support pathologist decision making, a digital image analysis algorithm that identifies tumor cells and quantifies the DKK1 signal was developed. Following CLIA guidelines the DKK1 RNAscope chromogenic in situ hybridization assay and digital image analysis algorithm were successfully validated for sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and precision. The DKK1 RNAscope assay in conjunction with the digital image analysis solution is acceptable for prospective screening of G/GEJ adenocarcinoma patients. The work described here will further advance the companion diagnostic development of our DKK1 RNAscope assay and could generally be used as a guide for the validation of RNAscope assays with digital image quantification.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: evasion; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
A hierarchical expert-guided machine learning framework for clinical decision support systems: an application to traumatic brain injury prognostication,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-021-00445-0,07 May 2021,"Prognosis of the long-term functional outcome of traumatic brain injury is essential for personalized management of that injury. Nonetheless, accurate prediction remains unavailable. Although machine learning has shown promise in many fields, including medical diagnosis and prognosis, such models are rarely deployed in real-world settings due to a lack of transparency and trustworthiness. To address these drawbacks, we propose a machine learning-based framework that is explainable and aligns with clinical domain knowledge. To build such a framework, additional layers of statistical inference and human expert validation are added to the model, which ensures the predicted risk score’s trustworthiness. Using 831 patients with moderate or severe traumatic brain injury to build a model using the proposed framework, an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and accuracy of 0.8085 and 0.7488 were achieved, respectively, in determining which patients will experience poor functional outcomes. The performance of the machine learning classifier is not adversely affected by the imposition of statistical and domain knowledge “checks and balances”. Finally, through a case study, we demonstrate how the decision made by a model might be biased if it is not audited carefully.",Conclusions not available,Gen AI,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Analysing nystagmus waveforms: a computational framework,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-89094-7,07 May 2021,"We present a new computational approach to analyse nystagmus waveforms. Our framework is designed to fully characterise the state of the nystagmus, aid clinical diagnosis and to quantify the dynamical changes in the oscillations over time. Both linear and nonlinear analyses of time series were used to determine the regularity and complexity of a specific homogenous phenotype of nystagmus. Two-dimensional binocular eye movement recordings were carried out on 5 adult subjects who exhibited a unilateral, uniplanar, vertical nystagmus secondary to a monocular late-onset severe visual loss in the oscillating eye (the Heimann-Bielschowsky Phenomenon). The non-affected eye held a central gaze in both horizontal and vertical planes (± 10 min. of arc). All affected eyes exhibited vertical oscillations, with mean amplitudes and frequencies ranging from 2.0°–4.0° to 0.25–1.5 Hz, respectively. Unstable periodic orbit analysis revealed only 1 subject exhibited a periodic oscillation. The remaining subjects were found to display quasiperiodic (n = 1) and nonperiodic (n = 3) oscillations. Phase space reconstruction allowed attractor identification and the computation of a time series complexity measure—the permutation entropy. The entropy measure was found to be able to distinguish between a periodic oscillation associated with a limit cycle attractor, a quasiperiodic oscillation associated with a torus attractor and nonperiodic oscillations associated with higher-dimensional attractors. Importantly, the permutation entropy was able to rank the oscillations, thereby providing an objective index of nystagmus complexity (range 0.15–0.21) that could not be obtained via unstable periodic orbit analysis or attractor identification alone. These results suggest that our framework provides a comprehensive methodology for characterising nystagmus, aiding differential diagnosis and also permitting investigation of the waveforms over time, thereby facilitating the quantification of future therapeutic managements. In addition, permutation entropy could provide an additional tool for future oculomotor modelling.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Systematic misestimation of machine learning performance in neuroimaging studies of depression,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41386-021-01020-7,06 May 2021,"We currently observe a disconcerting phenomenon in machine learning studies in psychiatry: While we would expect larger samples to yield better results due to the availability of more data, larger machine learning studies consistently show much weaker performance than the numerous small-scale studies. Here, we systematically investigated this effect focusing on one of the most heavily studied questions in the field, namely the classification of patients suffering from Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and healthy controls based on neuroimaging data. Drawing upon structural MRI data from a balanced sample of N = 1868 MDD patients and healthy controls from our recent international Predictive Analytics Competition (PAC), we first trained and tested a classification model on the full dataset which yielded an accuracy of 61%. Next, we mimicked the process by which researchers would draw samples of various sizes (N = 4 to N = 150) from the population and showed a strong risk of misestimation. Specifically, for small sample sizes (N = 20), we observe accuracies of up to 95%. For medium sample sizes (N = 100) accuracies up to 75% were found. Importantly, further investigation showed that sufficiently large test sets effectively protect against performance misestimation whereas larger datasets per se do not. While these results question the validity of a substantial part of the current literature, we outline the relatively low-cost remedy of larger test sets, which is readily available in most cases.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Inspection of the lens thickness with preoperative biometric measurements prevents an erroneous interpretation of posterior capsule during FLACS,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-89209-0,06 May 2021,"Optical opacity reduces quality of biometry images, making it potentially difficult to find the correct location for irradiation during femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery (FLACS). After experiencing a case of posterior capsule (PC) rupture because of optical opacity, we started lens thickness (LT) inspection, which indicates comparison of between intra- and pre-operatively measured LT. We retrospectively investigated the effectiveness of the LT inspection. One observer reviewed all FLACS treatment summaries for 3 years by CATALYS in the Jikei University Hospital, Tokyo. Based on the lines defining the PC on intraoperative OCT images, all cases were classified into three groups: undescribed, appropriate and inappropriate PC. Among the 1070 cases, 1047 cases had appropriate PC. In 19 cases, the PC line was undescribed because of dense cataract. Among 474 cases with no inspection, 4 cases had an inappropriate PC. Whereas, in 596 cases with the LT inspection, there was no case of an inappropriate PC. LT inspection significantly reduced the cases with inappropriate PC. The safety margins normally work to prevent severe complications. However, rare outlier cases had a high risk of severe complications. We propose LT inspection could be the most practical and convenient way for safety surgery.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Machine learning-based mortality prediction model for heat-related illness,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-88581-1,04 May 2021,"In this study, we aimed to develop and validate a machine learning-based mortality prediction model for hospitalized heat-related illness patients. After 2393 hospitalized patients were extracted from a multicentered heat-related illness registry in Japan, subjects were divided into the training set for development (n = 1516, data from 2014, 2017–2019) and the test set (n = 877, data from 2020) for validation. Twenty-four variables including characteristics of patients, vital signs, and laboratory test data at hospital arrival were trained as predictor features for machine learning. The outcome was death during hospital stay. In validation, the developed machine learning models (logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest, XGBoost) demonstrated favorable performance for outcome prediction with significantly increased values of the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPR) of 0.415 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.336–0.494], 0.395 [CI 0.318–0.472], 0.426 [CI 0.346–0.506], and 0.528 [CI 0.442–0.614], respectively, compared to that of the conventional acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE)-II score of 0.287 [CI 0.222–0.351] as a reference standard. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) values were also high over 0.92 in all models, although there were no statistical differences compared to APACHE-II. This is the first demonstration of the potential of machine learning-based mortality prediction models for heat-related illnesses.","In conclusion, a novel mortality prediction model for patients hospitalized with heat-related illness was developed using a machine learning technique. Although further improvement in the performance quality with increased sample size or inclusion of important variables, as well as prospective validation in a clinical setting are needed, our study demonstrated for the first time the potential of machine learning-based prediction models for heat-related illness.","Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Interrogation of gender disparity uncovers androgen receptor as the transcriptional activator for oncogenic miR-125b in gastric cancer,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41419-021-03727-3,04 May 2021,"There is a male preponderance in gastric cancer (GC), which suggests a role of androgen and androgen receptor (AR). However, the mechanism of AR signaling in GC especially in female patients remains obscure. We sought to identify the AR signaling pathway that might be related to prognosis and examine the potential clinical utility of the AR antagonist for treatment. Deep learning and gene set enrichment analysis was used to identify potential critical factors associated with gender bias in GC (n = 1390). Gene expression profile analysis was performed to screen differentially expressed genes associated with AR expression in the Tianjin discovery set (n = 90) and TCGA validation set (n = 341). Predictors of survival were identified via lasso regression analyses and validated in the expanded Tianjin cohort (n = 373). In vitro and in vivo experiments were established to determine the drug effect. The GC gender bias was attributable to sex chromosome abnormalities and AR signaling dysregulation. The candidates for AR-related gene sets were screened, and AR combined with miR-125b was associated with poor prognosis, particularly among female patients. AR was confirmed to directly regulate miR-125b expression. AR-miR-125b signaling pathway inhibited apoptosis and promoted proliferation. AR antagonist, bicalutamide, exerted anti-tumor activities and induced apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo, using GC cell lines and female patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model. We have shed light on gender differences by revealing a hormone-regulated oncogenic signaling pathway in GC. Our preclinical studies suggest that AR is a potential therapeutic target for this deadly cancer type, especially in female patients.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Gait analysis may distinguish progressive supranuclear palsy and Parkinson disease since the earliest stages,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-88877-2,29 Apr 2021,"Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a rare and rapidly progressing atypical parkinsonism. Albeit existing clinical criteria for PSP have good specificity and sensitivity, there is a need for biomarkers able to capture early objective disease-specific abnormalities. This study aimed to identify gait patterns specifically associated with early PSP. The study population comprised 104 consecutively enrolled participants (83 PD and 21 PSP patients). Gait was investigated using a gait analysis system during normal gait and a cognitive dual task. Univariate statistical analysis and binary logistic regression were used to compare all PD patients and all PSP patients, as well as newly diagnosed PD and early PSP patients. Gait pattern was poorer in PSP patients than in PD patients, even from early stages. PSP patients exhibited reduced velocity and increased measures of dynamic instability when compared to PD patients. Application of predictive models to gait data revealed that PD gait pattern was typified by increased cadence and longer cycle length, whereas a longer stance phase characterized PSP patients in both mid and early disease stages. The present study demonstrates that quantitative gait evaluation clearly distinguishes PSP patients from PD patients since the earliest stages of disease. First, this might candidate gait analysis as a reliable biomarker in both clinical and research setting. Furthermore, our results may offer speculative clues for conceiving early disease-specific rehabilitation strategies.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Quality by design modelling to support rapid RNA vaccine production against emerging infectious diseases,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41541-021-00322-7,29 Apr 2021,"Rapid-response vaccine production platform technologies, including RNA vaccines, are being developed to combat viral epidemics and pandemics. A key enabler of rapid response is having quality-oriented disease-agnostic manufacturing protocols ready ahead of outbreaks. We are the first to apply the Quality by Design (QbD) framework to enhance rapid-response RNA vaccine manufacturing against known and future viral pathogens. This QbD framework aims to support the development and consistent production of safe and efficacious RNA vaccines, integrating a novel qualitative methodology and a quantitative bioprocess model. The qualitative methodology identifies and assesses the direction, magnitude and shape of the impact of critical process parameters (CPPs) on critical quality attributes (CQAs). The mechanistic bioprocess model quantifies and maps the effect of four CPPs on the CQA of effective yield of RNA drug substance. Consequently, the first design space of an RNA vaccine synthesis bioreactor is obtained. The cost-yield optimization together with the probabilistic design space contribute towards automation of rapid-response, high-quality RNA vaccine production.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
A randomized sham-controlled trial on the effect of continuous positive airway pressure treatment on gait control in severe obstructive sleep apnea patients,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-88642-5,29 Apr 2021,"To determine the effect of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), the gold standard treatment for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), on gait control in severe OSAS patients. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, sham-controlled monocentric study in Grenoble Alpes University Hospital, France. Gait parameters were recorded under single and dual-task conditions using a visuo-verbal cognitive task (Stroop test), before and after the 8-week intervention period. Stride-time variability, a marker of gait control, was the primary study endpoint. Changes in the determinants of gait control were the main secondary outcomes. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: (NCT02345694). 24 patients [median (Q1; Q3)]: age: 59.5 (46.3; 66.8) years, 87.5% male, body mass index: 28.2 (24.7; 29.8) kg. m−2, apnea–hypopnea index: 51.6 (35.0; 61.4) events/h were randomized to be treated by effective CPAP (n = 12) or by sham-CPAP (n = 12). A complete case analysis  was performed, using a mixed linear regression model. CPAP elicited no significant improvement in stride-time variability compared to sham-CPAP. No difference was found regarding the determinants of gait control. This study is the first RCT to investigate the effects of CPAP on gait control. Eight weeks of CPAP treatment did not improve gait control in severe non-obese OSAS patients.

A novel algorithm to detect non-wear time from raw accelerometer data using deep convolutional neural networks,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-87757-z,23 Apr 2021,"To date, non-wear detection algorithms commonly employ a 30, 60, or even 90 mins interval or window in which acceleration values need to be below a threshold value. A major drawback of such intervals is that they need to be long enough to prevent false positives (type I errors), while short enough to prevent false negatives (type II errors), which limits detecting both short and longer episodes of non-wear time. In this paper, we propose a novel non-wear detection algorithm that eliminates the need for an interval. Rather than inspecting acceleration within intervals, we explore acceleration right before and right after an episode of non-wear time. We trained a deep convolutional neural network that was able to infer non-wear time by detecting when the accelerometer was removed and when it was placed back on again. We evaluate our algorithm against several baseline and existing non-wear algorithms, and our algorithm achieves a perfect precision, a recall of 0.9962, and an F1 score of 0.9981, outperforming all evaluated algorithms. Although our algorithm was developed using patterns learned from a hip-worn accelerometer, we propose algorithmic steps that can easily be applied to a wrist-worn accelerometer and a retrained classification model.",Conclusions not available,DNN,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: ; Attacker Capability:

For high-risk patients requiring intensive care unit stay, predicting transfusion needs during the first 24 h using dynamic risk assessment may improve resuscitation with red blood cell transfusion in admitted patients with severe acute gastrointestinal bleeding. A patient cohort admitted for acute gastrointestinal bleeding (N = 2,524) was identified from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) critical care database and separated into training (N = 2,032) and internal validation (N = 492) sets. The external validation patient cohort was identified from the eICU collaborative database of patients admitted for acute gastrointestinal bleeding presenting to large urban hospitals (N = 1,526). 62 demographic, clinical, and laboratory test features were consolidated into 4-h time intervals over the first 24 h from admission. The outcome measure was the transfusion of red blood cells during each 4-h time interval. A long short-term memory (LSTM) model, a type of Recurrent Neural Network, was compared to a regression-based models on time-updated data. The LSTM model performed better than discrete time regression-based models for both internal validation (AUROC 0.81 vs 0.75 vs 0.75; P < 0.001) and external validation (AUROC 0.65 vs 0.56 vs 0.56; P < 0.001).

Our dataset consists of N = 135,667 fundus images and N = 85,536 volumetric OCT scans. Deep learning models were trained to predict the patient’s age and sex from fundus images, OCT cross sections and OCT volumes. For sex prediction, a ROC AUC of 0.80 was achieved for fundus images, 0.84 for OCT cross sections and 0.90 for OCT volumes. Age prediction mean absolute errors of 6.328 years for fundus, 5.625 years for OCT cross sections and 4.541 for OCT volumes were observed. We assess the performance of OCT scans containing different biomarkers and note a peak performance of AUC = 0.88 for OCT cross sections and 0.95 for volumes when there is no pathology on scans. Performance drops in case of drusen, fibrovascular pigment epitheliuum detachment and geographic atrophy present. We conclude that deep learning based methods are capable of classifying the patient’s sex and age from color fundus photography and OCT for a broad spectrum of patients irrespective of underlying disease or image quality. Non-random sex prediction using fundus images seems only possible if the eye fovea and optic disc are visible.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Development and validation of an early warning tool for sepsis and decompensation in children during emergency department triage,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-87595-z,21 Apr 2021,"This study was designed to develop and validate an early warning system for sepsis based on a predictive model of critical decompensation. Data from the electronic medical records for 537,837 visits to a pediatric Emergency Department (ED) from March 2013 to December 2019 were collected. A multiclass stochastic gradient boosting model was built to identify early warning signs associated with death, severe sepsis, non-severe sepsis, and bacteremia. Model features included triage vital signs, previous diagnoses, medications, and healthcare utilizations within 6 months of the index ED visit. There were 483 patients who had severe sepsis and/or died, 1102 had non-severe sepsis, 1103 had positive bacteremia tests, and the remaining had none of the events. The most important predictors were age, heart rate, length of stay of previous hospitalizations, temperature, systolic blood pressure, and prior sepsis. The one-versus-all area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC) were 0.979 (0.967, 0.991), 0.990 (0.985, 0.995), 0.976 (0.972, 0.981), and 0.968 (0.962, 0.974) for death, severe sepsis, non-severe sepsis, and bacteremia without sepsis respectively. The multi-class macro average AUROC and area under the precision recall curve were 0.977 and 0.316 respectively.

The advancement of breast tumors in nude mice was validated by tumor volume kinetics and histopathology and corresponding image analysis by TissueQuant software compared to controls. The ex vivo tumors in progressive conditions belonging to time points, day 5th, 10th, 15th & 20th, were excited with 281 nm pulsed laser light and recorded the corresponding photoacoustic spectra in time domain.

In the present study, the top 10 features from all the time point groups under study were selected based on their prediction ranking values using the mRMR algorithm. The chosen features of all the time-point groups were then subjected to multi-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms for learning and classifying into respective time point groups under study. The analysis demonstrated accuracy values of 95.2%, 99.5%, and 80.3% with SVM- Radial Basis Function (SVM-RBF), SVM-Polynomial & SVM-Linear, respectively.

Interpretable survival prediction for colorectal cancer using deep learning,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-021-00427-2,19 Apr 2021,"Deriving interpretable prognostic features from deep-learning-based prognostic histopathology models remains a challenge. In this study, we developed a deep learning system (DLS) for predicting disease-specific survival for stage II and III colorectal cancer using 3652 cases (27,300 slides). When evaluated on two validation datasets containing 1239 cases (9340 slides) and 738 cases (7140 slides), respectively, the DLS achieved a 5-year disease-specific survival AUC of 0.70 (95% CI: 0.66–0.73) and 0.69 (95% CI: 0.64–0.72), and added significant predictive value to a set of nine clinicopathologic features. To interpret the DLS, we explored the ability of different human-interpretable features to explain the variance in DLS scores. We observed that clinicopathologic features such as T-category, N-category, and grade explained a small fraction of the variance in DLS scores (R2 = 18% in both validation sets). Next, we generated human-interpretable histologic features by clustering embeddings from a deep-learning-based image-similarity model and showed that they explained the majority of the variance (R2 of 73–80%). Furthermore, the clustering-derived feature most strongly associated with high DLS scores was also highly prognostic in isolation. With a distinct visual appearance (poorly differentiated tumor cell clusters adjacent to adipose tissue), this feature was identified by annotators with 87.0–95.5% accuracy. Our approach can be used to explain predictions from a prognostic deep learning model and uncover potentially-novel prognostic features that can be reliably identified by people for future validation studies.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

The huge amount of acquired data requires efficient, ideally automated image processing pipelines, with cell localization/segmentation as central tasks. Automated segmentation in live-cell cytosolic \(\hbox {Ca}^{2+}\) imaging data is, however, challenging due to temporal image intensity fluctuations, low signal-to-noise ratio, and photo-bleaching. Here, we propose a reservoir computing (RC) framework for efficient and temporally consistent segmentation. Experiments were conducted with Jurkat T-cells and anti-CD3 coated beads used for T-cell activation. We compared the RC performance with a standard U-Net and a convolutional long short-term memory (LSTM) model. The RC-based models (1) perform on par in terms of segmentation accuracy with the deep learning models for cell-only segmentation, but show improved temporal segmentation consistency compared to the U-Net; (2) outperform the U-Net for two-emission wavelengths image segmentation and differentiation of T-cells and beads; and (3) perform on par with the convolutional LSTM for single-emission wavelength T-cell/bead segmentation and differentiation. In turn, RC models contain only a fraction of the parameters of the baseline models and reduce the training time considerably.",The current work demonstrates reservoir computing to be an efficient alternative to computationally expensive deep learning-based networks for temporally consistent cell segmentation in high-resolution live-cell \(\hbox {Ca}^{2+}\) imaging.,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Medical records-based chronic kidney disease phenotype for clinical care and “big data” observational and genetic studies,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-021-00428-1,13 Apr 2021,"Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) represents a slowly progressive disorder that is typically silent until late stages, but early intervention can significantly delay its progression.

Independent case-control validation using 2350 patient records demonstrated diagnostic specificity of 97% and sensitivity of 87%. Application of the phenotype to 1.3 million patients demonstrated that over 80% of CKD cases are undetected using ICD codes alone. We also demonstrated several large-scale applications of the phenotype, including identifying stage-specific kidney disease comorbidities, in silico estimation of kidney trait heritability in thousands of pedigrees reconstructed from medical records, and biobank-based multicenter genome-wide and phenome-wide association studies.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Investigations on the potential of optical coherence tomography as an imaging tool for eustachian tube,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-87637-6,13 Apr 2021,"The purpose of this study was to explore the feasibility of eustachian tube optical coherence tomography (ET-OCT) for imaging the pharyngeal region of the eustachian tube (ET). Ten subjects with ear complaints underwent ET-OCT guided by nasal endoscopy, and ET-OCT examination was performed on both sides of each subject's ETs. The process and resulting images were analysed. Ten subjects ranging from 21 to 73 years old (45 ± 14.77) were enrolled in this study. Eighteen ET-OCT imaging examinations were completed. The mean duration of each examination was 2.80 ± 1.62 min (ranging from 2 to 7 min). There were no adverse events or complications. In some subjects, the ET-OCT images clearly presented the microstructures of the ET wall, including the lumen, mucosa, submucosa, cartilage and plica. However, in some subjects, it showed different characteristics, such as an unclear hierarchy and secretions in the lumen. ET-OCT may help to distinguish the structural composition of the ET and elucidate related pathophysiological mechanisms. It is a valuable imaging tool suited for the ET, with potential diagnostic value in determining the morphology of the lumen, intraluminal mucosa and submucosal tissue in the pharyngeal region of the ET.",Conclusions not available,DNN,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
"COVID-19 information retrieval with deep-learning based semantic search, question answering, and abstractive summarization",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-021-00437-0,12 Apr 2021,"The COVID-19 global pandemic has resulted in international efforts to understand, track, and mitigate the disease, yielding a significant corpus of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2-related publications across scientific disciplines. Throughout 2020, over 400,000 coronavirus-related publications have been collected through the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset. Here, we present CO-Search, a semantic, multi-stage, search engine designed to handle complex queries over the COVID-19 literature, potentially aiding overburdened health workers in finding scientific answers and avoiding misinformation during a time of crisis. CO-Search is built from two sequential parts: a hybrid semantic-keyword retriever, which takes an input query and returns a sorted list of the 1000 most relevant documents, and a re-ranker, which further orders them by relevance. The retriever is composed of a deep learning model (Siamese-BERT) that encodes query-level meaning, along with two keyword-based models (BM25, TF-IDF) that emphasize the most important words of a query. The re-ranker assigns a relevance score to each document, computed from the outputs of (1) a question–answering module which gauges how much each document answers the query, and (2) an abstractive summarization module which determines how well a query matches a generated summary of the document. To account for the relatively limited dataset, we develop a text augmentation technique which splits the documents into pairs of paragraphs and the citations contained in them, creating millions of (citation title, paragraph) tuples for training the retriever. We evaluate our system (http://einstein.ai/covid) on the data of the TREC-COVID information retrieval challenge, obtaining strong performance across multiple key information retrieval metrics.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI","Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient, healthcare practitioner; Attacker Capability: "
Central and mid-peripheral corneal astigmatism in an elderly population: a retrospective analysis of Scheimpflug topography results,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-81772-w,12 Apr 2021,"Implantation of toric intraocular lenses (IOLs) has become standard in the correction of corneal astigmatism. The IOL selection is based on keratometric measurements of the central cornea. However, mid-peripheral corneal changes may yield suboptimal correction in patients with larger pupils. This study retrospectively analyzed corneal topography data collected using a Scheimpflug device during routine clinical examinations. Of 11,953 patients, 641 met the inclusion criteria. Total corneal astigmatism was compared between five concentric zones (2–6 mm) using vector analysis. The absolute difference between astigmatism at 2 mm and 6 mm was 0.30 D (− 0.36 to 0.64), which decreased to 0.10 D (0 to 0.20) between the 5- and 6-mm zone. With-the-rule astigmatism was the most prevalent (53%), 34% had against-the-rule (ATR), and 13% had oblique. The decrease of the cylinder power with the diameter differed significantly between the three types, with ATR and oblique astigmatism being associated with the steepest change. Patients with high corneal astigmatism tend to demonstrate larger differences between the center and mid-periphery than those with low and moderate astigmatism. In conclusion, we demonstrated that central corneal astigmatism differs from that measured at the mid-periphery and that a larger difference was found in patients with ATR, oblique and high astigmatism.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Motor and sensory features successfully decode autism spectrum disorder and combine with the original RDoC framework to boost diagnostic classification,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-87455-w,09 Apr 2021,"Sensory processing and motor coordination atypicalities are not commonly identified as primary characteristics of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), nor are they well captured in the NIMH’s original Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework. Here, motor and sensory features performed similarly to RDoC features in support vector classification of 30 ASD youth against 33 typically developing controls. Combining sensory with RDoC features boosted classification performance, achieving a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.949 and balanced accuracy (BAcc) of 0.971 (p = 0.00020, calculated against a permuted null distribution). Sensory features alone successfully classified ASD (MCC = 0.565, BAcc = 0.773, p = 0.0222) against a clinically relevant control group of 26 youth with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) and were in fact required to decode against DCD above chance.

Development of a multivariable prediction model for severe COVID-19 disease: a population-based study from Hong Kong,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-021-00433-4,08 Apr 2021,"Recent studies have reported numerous predictors for adverse outcomes in COVID-19 disease. However, there have been few simple clinical risk scores available for prompt risk stratification. The objective is to develop a simple risk score for predicting severe COVID-19 disease using territory-wide data based on simple clinical and laboratory variables. Consecutive patients admitted to Hong Kong’s public hospitals between 1 January and 22 August 2020 and diagnosed with COVID-19, as confirmed by RT-PCR, were included. The primary outcome was composite intensive care unit admission, need for intubation or death with follow-up until 8 September 2020. An external independent cohort from Wuhan was used for model validation. COVID-19 testing was performed in 237,493 patients and 4442 patients (median age 44.8 years old, 95% confidence interval (CI): [28.9, 60.8]); 50% males) were tested positive. Of these, 209 patients (4.8%) met the primary outcome. A risk score including the following components was derived from Cox regression: gender, age, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, ischemic heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, stroke, dementia, liver diseases, gastrointestinal bleeding, cancer, increases in neutrophil count, potassium, urea, creatinine, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, bilirubin, D-dimer, high sensitive troponin-I, lactate dehydrogenase, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, and C-reactive protein, as well as decreases in lymphocyte count, platelet, hematocrit, albumin, sodium, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, cholesterol, glucose, and base excess. The model based on test results taken on the day of admission demonstrated an excellent predictive value. Incorporation of test results on successive time points did not further improve risk prediction. The derived score system was evaluated with out-of-sample five-cross-validation (AUC: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.82–0.91) and external validation (N = 202, AUC: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.85–0.93).

Development of machine learning model for diagnostic disease prediction based on laboratory tests,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-87171-5,07 Apr 2021,"The use of deep learning and machine learning (ML) in medical science is increasing, particularly in the visual, audio, and language data fields. We aimed to build a new optimized ensemble model by blending a DNN (deep neural network) model with two ML models for disease prediction using laboratory test results. 86 attributes (laboratory tests) were selected from datasets based on value counts, clinical importance-related features, and missing values. We collected sample datasets on 5145 cases, including 326,686 laboratory test results. We investigated a total of 39 specific diseases based on the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) codes. These datasets were used to construct light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) ML models and a DNN model using TensorFlow. The optimized ensemble model achieved an F1-score of 81% and prediction accuracy of 92% for the five most common diseases. The deep learning and ML models showed differences in predictive power and disease classification patterns. We used a confusion matrix and analyzed feature importance using the SHAP value method. Our new ML model achieved high efficiency of disease prediction through classification of diseases.

Crowdsourced privacy-preserved feature tagging of short home videos for machine learning ASD detection,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-87059-4,07 Apr 2021,"Standard medical diagnosis of mental health conditions requires licensed experts who are increasingly outnumbered by those at risk, limiting reach. We test the hypothesis that a trustworthy crowd of non-experts can efficiently annotate behavioral features needed for accurate machine learning detection of the common childhood developmental disorder Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) for children under 8 years old. We implement a novel process for identifying and certifying a trustworthy distributed workforce for video feature extraction, selecting a workforce of 102 workers from a pool of 1,107. Two previously validated ASD logistic regression classifiers, evaluated against parent-reported diagnoses, were used to assess the accuracy of the trusted crowd’s ratings of unstructured home videos. A representative balanced sample (N = 50 videos) of videos were evaluated with and without face box and pitch shift privacy alterations, with AUROC and AUPRC scores > 0.98. With both privacy-preserving modifications, sensitivity is preserved (96.0%) while maintaining specificity (80.0%) and accuracy (88.0%) at levels comparable to prior classification methods without alterations. We find that machine learning classification from features extracted by a certified nonexpert crowd achieves high performance for ASD detection from natural home videos of the child at risk and maintains high sensitivity when privacy-preserving mechanisms are applied. These results suggest that privacy-safeguarded crowdsourced analysis of short home videos can help enable rapid and mobile machine-learning detection of developmental delays in children.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Assessing the relationship between pregravid body mass index and risk of adverse maternal pregnancy and neonatal outcomes: prospective data in Southwest China,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-87135-9,07 Apr 2021,"The relevance of pregestational body mass index (BMI) on adverse pregnancy outcomes remained unclear in Southwest China. This study aimed to investigate the overall and age-category specific association between pre-gestational BMI and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), preeclampsia, cesarean delivery, preterm delivery, stillbirth, macrosomia, and small-for-gestational age (SGA) or large-for-gestational age (LGA) neonates in Southwest China. Furthermore, it explores the relative importance of influence of pregravid BMI and maternal age on pregnancy outcomes. 51,125 Chinese singleton pregnant women were recruited as study subjects. Multiple logistic regression models were used to examine the influence of pre-pregnancy BMI on adverse pregnancy outcomes. Gradient boosting machine was used to evaluate the relative importance of influence of pregravid BMI and maternal age on pregnancy outcomes. It is found that women who were overweight or obese before pregnancy are at higher risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes except for SGA neonates, while pre-pregnancy underweight is a protective factor for GDM, preeclampsia, cesarean delivery, macrosomia and LGA, but not SGA. Younger mothers are more susceptible to GDM and macrosomia neonates, while older mothers are more prone to preeclampsia. Pre-pregnancy BMI has more influence on various pregnancy outcomes than maternal age. To improve pregnancy outcomes, normal BMI weight as well as relatively young maternal ages are recommended for women in child-bearing age.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Real-time coronary artery stenosis detection based on modern neural networks,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-87174-2,07 Apr 2021,"Invasive coronary angiography remains the gold standard for diagnosing coronary artery disease, which may be complicated by both, patient-specific anatomy and image quality. Deep learning techniques aimed at detecting coronary artery stenoses may facilitate the diagnosis. However, previous studies have failed to achieve superior accuracy and performance for real-time labeling. Our study is aimed at confirming the feasibility of real-time coronary artery stenosis detection using deep learning methods. To reach this goal we trained and tested eight promising detectors based on different neural network architectures (MobileNet, ResNet-50, ResNet-101, Inception ResNet, NASNet) using clinical angiography data of 100 patients. Three neural networks have demonstrated superior results. The network based on Faster-RCNN Inception ResNet V2 is the most accurate and it achieved the mean Average Precision of 0.95, F1-score 0.96 and the slowest prediction rate of 3 fps on the validation subset. The relatively lightweight SSD MobileNet V2 network proved itself as the fastest one with a low mAP of 0.83, F1-score of 0.80 and a mean prediction rate of 38 fps. The model based on RFCN ResNet-101 V2 has demonstrated an optimal accuracy-to-speed ratio. Its mAP makes up 0.94, F1-score 0.96 while the prediction speed is 10 fps. The resultant performance-accuracy balance of the modern neural networks has confirmed the feasibility of real-time coronary artery stenosis detection supporting the decision-making process of the Heart Team interpreting coronary angiography findings.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Here we systematically evaluate the effect of different eligibility criteria on cancer trial populations and outcomes with real-world data using the computational framework of Trial Pathfinder. We apply Trial Pathfinder to emulate completed trials of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer using data from a nationwide database of electronic health records comprising 61,094 patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. Our analyses reveal that many common criteria, including exclusions based on several laboratory values, had a minimal effect on the trial hazard ratios. When we used a data-driven approach to broaden restrictive criteria, the pool of eligible patients more than doubled on average and the hazard ratio of the overall survival decreased by an average of 0.05. This suggests that many patients who were not eligible under the original trial criteria could potentially benefit from the treatments. We further support our findings through analyses of other types of cancer and patient-safety data from diverse clinical trials. Our data-driven methodology for evaluating eligibility criteria can facilitate the design of more-inclusive trials while maintaining safeguards for patient safety.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Unsupervised behaviour analysis and magnification (uBAM) using deep learning,https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-021-00326-x,05 Apr 2021,"Motor behaviour analysis is essential to biomedical research and clinical diagnostics as it provides a non-invasive strategy for identifying motor impairment and its change caused by interventions. State-of-the-art instrumented movement analysis is time- and cost-intensive, because it requires the placement of physical or virtual markers. As well as the effort required for marking the keypoints or annotations necessary for training or fine-tuning a detector, users need to know the interesting behaviour beforehand to provide meaningful keypoints. Here, we introduce unsupervised behaviour analysis and magnification (uBAM), an automatic deep learning algorithm for analysing behaviour by discovering and magnifying deviations. A central aspect is unsupervised learning of posture and behaviour representations to enable an objective comparison of movement. Besides discovering and quantifying deviations in behaviour, we also propose a generative model for visually magnifying subtle behaviour differences directly in a video without requiring a detour via keypoints or annotations. Essential for this magnification of deviations, even across different individuals, is a disentangling of appearance and behaviour. Evaluations on rodents and human patients with neurological diseases demonstrate the wide applicability of our approach. Moreover, combining optogenetic stimulation with our unsupervised behaviour analysis shows its suitability as a non-invasive diagnostic tool correlating function to brain plasticity.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

The ratio of total bilirubin before and after the first time of ALSS treatment was the most significant prognostic factor, we named it RPTB. Further, a decision tree based on the multivariate logistic regression model using CTP score and the RPTB was built, dividing patients into 3 main groups such as favorable prognosis group, moderate prognosis group and poor prognosis group. A clearly-presented and easily-understood decision tree was built with a good predictive value of prognosis in HBV-related ACLF patients after first-time ALSS treatment.

Deep learning and ensemble stacking technique for differentiating polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy from neovascular age-related macular degeneration,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-86526-2,30 Mar 2021,"Polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) and neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) share some similarity in clinical imaging manifestations. However, their disease entity and treatment strategy as well as visual outcomes are very different. To distinguish these two vision-threatening diseases is somewhat challenging but necessary. In this study, we propose a new artificial intelligence model using an ensemble stacking technique, which combines a color fundus photograph-based deep learning (DL) model and optical coherence tomography-based biomarkers, for differentiation of PCV from nAMD. Furthermore, we introduced multiple correspondence analysis, a method of transforming categorical data into principal components, to handle the dichotomous data for combining with another image DL system.

Variable selection with false discovery rate control in deep neural networks,https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-021-00308-z,29 Mar 2021,"Deep neural networks are famous for their high prediction accuracy, but they are also known for their black-box nature and poor interpretability. We consider the problem of variable selection, that is, selecting the input variables that have significant predictive power on the output, in deep neural networks. Most existing variable selection methods for neural networks are only applicable to shallow networks or are computationally infeasible on large datasets; moreover, they lack a control on the quality of selected variables. Here we propose a backward elimination procedure called SurvNet, which is based on a new measure of variable importance that applies to a wide variety of networks. More importantly, SurvNet is able to estimate and control the false discovery rate of selected variables empirically. Further, SurvNet adaptively determines how many variables to eliminate at each step in order to maximize the selection efficiency. The validity and efficiency of SurvNet are shown on various simulated and real datasets, and its performance is compared with other methods. Especially, a systematic comparison with knockoff-based methods shows that although they have more rigorous false discovery rate control on data with strong variable correlation, SurvNet usually has higher power.","We have presented a largely automatic procedure for variable selection in neural networks (SurvNet). It is based on a new measure of variable importance that applies to a variety of networks, deep or shallow, for regression or classification, and with one or multiple output units. More importantly, SurvNet aims to estimate and control the FDR of selected variables in neural networks, which is essential for applications where the trustworthiness of variable selection is pivotal. By introducing surrogate variables, it avoids training multiple networks in parallel. SurvNet also adjusts the number of variables to eliminate at each step, and the ‘warm start’ nature of backward elimination facilitates the training of networks. On multiple simulation datasets and real datasets, SurvNet has effectively identified the significant variables. It has given a dependable estimate of FDR as well, in almost all datasets we considered.SurvNet takes advantages of modern developments of DNNs. The importance scores of input variables that are based on derivatives with respect to the inputs can be efficiently computed by functions in deep-learning packages such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Theano. Moreover, advances in optimization techniques and computation platforms have made the training of DNNs highly scalable. In particular, DNNs can accommodate a large number of input variables, which enables the introduction of surrogate variables.","Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: ; Attacker Capability: 
Transforming electronic health record polysomnographic data into the Observational Medical Outcome Partnership's Common Data Model: a pilot feasibility study,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-86564-w,29 Mar 2021,"Well-defined large-volume polysomnographic (PSG) data can identify subgroups and predict outcomes of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). However, current PSG data are scattered across numerous sleep laboratories and have different formats in the electronic health record (EHR). Hence, this study aimed to convert EHR PSG into a standardized data format—the Observational Medical Outcome Partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM). We extracted the PSG data of a university hospital for the period from 2004 to 2019. We designed and implemented an extract–transform–load (ETL) process to transform PSG data into the OMOP CDM format and verified the data quality through expert evaluation. We converted the data of 11,797 sleep studies into CDM and added 632,841 measurements and 9,535 observations to the existing CDM database. Among 86 PSG parameters, 20 were mapped to CDM standard vocabulary and 66 could not be mapped; thus, new custom standard concepts were created. We validated the conversion and usefulness of PSG data through patient-level prediction analyses for the CDM data. We believe that this study represents the first CDM conversion of PSG. In the future, CDM transformation will enable network research in sleep medicine and will contribute to presenting more relevant clinical evidence.","The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) is a standard data format and has been applied to various EHR databases. However, its application to PSG data has not been attempted till date. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first attempt to transform PSG data into the OMOP CDM format. Well-defined large-volume OMOP CDM databases of PSG data can potentially enable the identification of clinically relevant OSA phenotypes, estimation of disease outcomes at the population level and prediction of outcomes at the patient-level. We expect the CDM mapping and CDM custom vocabulary of the PSG proposed in this study to contribute to the CDM conversion of PSG databases and future studies leveraging such databases.","Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Using this quantitative index from eyes of 860 myopic patients, support vector machine based machine learning classifier predicted pathologic myopia an AUROC of 0.828, with 77.5% sensitivity and 88.07% specificity. Axial length and choroidal thickness, the existing quantitative indicator of pathologic myopia only reached an AUROC of 0.758, with 75.0% sensitivity and 76.61% specificity. When all six indices were applied (four TEPS, AxL, and SCT), the discriminative ability of the SVM model was excellent, demonstrating an AUROC of 0.868, with 80.0% sensitivity and 93.58% specificity.

Bacteremic sepsis leads to higher mortality when adjusting for confounders with propensity score matching,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-86346-4,26 Mar 2021,"One can falsely assume that it is well known that bacteremia is associated with higher mortality in sepsis. Only a handful of studies specifically focus on the comparison of culture-negative and culture-positive sepsis with different conclusions depending on study design. The aim of this study was to describe outcome for critically ill patients with either culture-positive or -negative sepsis in a clinical review. We also aimed to identify subphenotypes of sepsis with culture status included as candidate clinical variables. Out of 784 patients treated in intensive care with a sepsis diagnosis, blood cultures were missing in 140 excluded patients and 95 excluded patients did not fulfill a sepsis diagnosis. Of 549 included patients, 295 (54%) had bacteremia, 90 (16%) were non-bacteremic but with relevant pathogens detected and in 164 (30%) no relevant pathogen was detected. After adjusting for confounders, 90-day mortality was higher in bacteremic patients, 47%, than in non-bacteremic patients, 36%, p = 0.04. We identified 8 subphenotypes, with different mortality rates, where pathogen detection in microbial samples were important for subphenotype distinction and outcome. In conclusion, bacteremic patients had higher mortality than their non-bacteremic counter-parts and bacteremia is more common in sepsis when studied in a clinical review. For reducing population heterogeneity and improve the outcome of trials and treatment for sepsis, distinction of subphenotypes might be useful and pathogen detection an important factor.","In summary, bacteremia as well as preceding antibiotic treatment in non-bacteremic patients are related to poor outcome. Bacteremia is more common than previously described in sepsis, when a clinical chart review is used as gold-standard. A substantial portion of sepsis patients that remain microbiology-negative cannot be attributed to misdiagnosis or preceding antibiotic treatment. Distinction of subphenotypes might be useful and we demonstrated microbiological-negativity to be an important factor of a subphenotype for sepsis, with potential to reduce population and treatment heterogeneity for sepsis and improve the outcome of trials.","Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Methodological considerations for identifying multiple plasma proteins associated with all-cause mortality in a population-based prospective cohort,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-85991-z,24 Mar 2021,"Novel methods to characterize the plasma proteome has made it possible to examine a wide range of proteins in large longitudinal cohort studies, but the complexity of the human proteome makes it difficult to identify robust protein-disease associations. Nevertheless, identification of individuals at high risk of early mortality is a central issue in clinical decision making and novel biomarkers may be useful to improve risk stratification. With adjustment for established risk factors, we examined the associations between 138 plasma proteins measured using two proximity extension assays and long-term risk of all-cause mortality in 3,918 participants of the population-based Malmö Diet and Cancer Study. To examine the reproducibility of protein-mortality associations we used a two-step random-split approach to simulate a discovery and replication cohort and conducted analyses using four different methods: Cox regression, stepwise Cox regression, Lasso-Cox regression, and random survival forest (RSF). In the total study population, we identified eight proteins that associated with all-cause mortality after adjustment for established risk factors and with Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. In the two-step analyses, the number of proteins selected for model inclusion in both random samples ranged from 6 to 21 depending on the method used. However, only three proteins were consistently included in both samples across all four methods (growth/differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15), N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, and epididymal secretory protein E4). Using the total study population, the C-statistic for a model including established risk factors was 0.7222 and increased to 0.7284 with inclusion of the most predictive protein (GDF-15; P < 0.0001). All multiple protein models showed additional improvement in the C-statistic compared to the single protein model (all P < 0.0001). We identified several plasma proteins associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality independently of established risk factors. Further investigation into the putatively causal role of these proteins for longevity is needed. In addition, the examined methods for identifying multiple proteins showed tendencies for overfitting by including several putatively false positive findings. Thus, the reproducibility of findings using such approaches may be limited.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Development of a semi-automated segmentation tool for high frequency ultrasound image analysis of mouse echocardiograms,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-85971-3,22 Mar 2021,"Echocardiography is a widely used and clinically translatable imaging modality for the evaluation of cardiac structure and function in preclinical drug discovery and development. Echocardiograms are among the first in vivo diagnostic tools utilized to evaluate the heart due to its relatively low cost, high throughput acquisition, and non-invasive nature; however lengthy manual image analysis, intra- and inter-operator variability, and subjective image analysis presents a challenge for reproducible data generation in preclinical research. To combat the image-processing bottleneck and address both variability and reproducibly challenges, we developed a semi-automated analysis algorithm workflow to analyze long- and short-axis murine left ventricle (LV) ultrasound images. The long-axis B-mode algorithm executes a script protocol that is trained using a reference library of 322 manually segmented LV ultrasound images. The short-axis script was engineered to analyze M-mode ultrasound images in a semi-automated fashion using a pixel intensity evaluation approach, allowing analysts to place two seed-points to triangulate the local maxima of LV wall boundary annotations. Blinded operator evaluation of the semi-automated analysis tool was performed and compared to the current manual segmentation methodology for testing inter- and intra-operator reproducibility at baseline and after a pharmacologic challenge. Comparisons between manual and semi-automatic derivation of LV ejection fraction resulted in a relative difference of 1% for long-axis (B-mode) images and 2.7% for short-axis (M-mode) images. Our semi-automatic workflow approach reduces image analysis time and subjective bias, as well as decreases inter- and intra-operator variability, thereby enhancing throughput and improving data quality for pre-clinical in vivo studies that incorporate cardiac structure and function endpoints.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Changes in the brain structural connectome after a prospective randomized clinical trial of lithium and quetiapine treatment in youth with bipolar disorder,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41386-021-00989-5,22 Mar 2021,"The goals of the current study were to determine whether topological organization of brain structural networks is altered in youth with bipolar disorder, whether such alterations predict treatment outcomes, and whether they are normalized by treatment. Youth with bipolar disorder were randomized to double-blind treatment with quetiapine or lithium and assessed weekly. High-resolution MRI images were collected from children and adolescents with bipolar disorder who were experiencing a mixed or manic episode (n = 100) and healthy youth (n = 63). Brain networks were constructed based on the similarity of morphological features across regions and analyzed using graph theory approaches. We tested for pretreatment anatomical differences between bipolar and healthy youth and for changes in neuroanatomic network metrics following treatment in the youth with bipolar disorder. Youth with bipolar disorder showed significantly increased clustering coefficient (Cp) (p = 0.009) and characteristic path length (Lp) (p = 0.04) at baseline, and altered nodal centralities in insula, inferior frontal gyrus, and supplementary motor area. Cp, Lp, and nodal centrality of the insula exhibited normalization in patients following treatment. Changes in these neuroanatomic parameters were correlated with improvement in manic symptoms but did not differ between the two drug therapies. Baseline structural network matrices significantly differentiated medication responders and non-responders with 80% accuracy. These findings demonstrate that both global and nodal structural network features are altered in early course bipolar disorder, and that pretreatment alterations in neuroanatomic features predicted treatment outcome and were reduced by treatment. Similar connectome normalization with lithium and quetiapine suggests that the connectome changes are a downstream effect of both therapies that is related to their clinical efficacy.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Distant metastasis time to event analysis with CNNs in independent head and neck cancer cohorts,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-85671-y,19 Mar 2021,"Deep learning models based on medical images play an increasingly important role for cancer outcome prediction. The standard approach involves usage of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automatically extract relevant features from the patient’s image and perform a binary classification of the occurrence of a given clinical endpoint. In this work, a 2D-CNN and a 3D-CNN for the binary classification of distant metastasis (DM) occurrence in head and neck cancer patients were extended to perform time-to-event analysis. The newly built CNNs incorporate censoring information and output DM-free probability curves as a function of time for every patient. In total, 1037 patients were used to build and assess the performance of the time-to-event model. Training and validation was based on 294 patients also used in a previous benchmark classification study while for testing 743 patients from three independent cohorts were used. The best network could reproduce the good results from 3-fold cross validation [Harrell’s concordance indices (HCIs) of 0.78, 0.74 and 0.80] in two out of three testing cohorts (HCIs of 0.88, 0.67 and 0.77). Additionally, the capability of the models for patient stratification into high and low-risk groups was investigated, the CNNs being able to significantly stratify all three testing cohorts. Results suggest that image-based deep learning models show good reliability for DM time-to-event analysis and could be used for treatment personalisation.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Semi-automatic liver segmentation based on probabilistic models and anatomical constraints,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-85436-7,17 Mar 2021,"Segmenting a liver and its peripherals from abdominal computed tomography is a crucial step toward computer aided diagnosis and therapeutic intervention. Despite the recent advances in computing methods, faithfully segmenting the liver has remained a challenging task, due to indefinite boundary, intensity inhomogeneity, and anatomical variations across subjects. In this paper, a semi-automatic segmentation method based on multivariable normal distribution of liver tissues and graph-cut sub-division is presented. Although it is not fully automated, the method minimally involves human interactions. Specifically, it consists of three main stages. Firstly, a subject specific probabilistic model was built from an interior patch, surrounding a seed point specified by the user. Secondly, an iterative assignment of pixel labels was applied to gradually update the probabilistic map of the tissues based on spatio-contextual information. Finally, the graph-cut model was optimized to extract the 3D liver from the image. During post-processing, overly segmented nodal regions due to fuzzy tissue separation were removed, maintaining its correct anatomy by using robust bottleneck detection with adjacent contour constraint. The proposed system was implemented and validated on the MICCAI SLIVER07 dataset. The experimental results were benchmarked against the state-of-the-art methods, based on major clinically relevant metrics. Both visual and numerical assessments reported herein indicated that the proposed system could improve the accuracy and reliability of asymptomatic liver segmentation.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Concomitant drugs associated with increased mortality for MDMA users reported in a drug safety surveillance database,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-85389-x,16 Mar 2021,"3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is currently being evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). If MDMA is FDA-approved it will be important to understand what medications may pose a risk of drug–drug interactions. The goal of this study was to evaluate the risks due to MDMA ingestion alone or in combination with other common medications and drugs of abuse using the FDA drug safety surveillance data. To date, nearly one thousand reports of MDMA use have been reported to the FDA. The majority of these reports include covariates such as co-ingested substances and demographic parameters. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was employed to uncover the contributing factors to the reported risk of death among MDMA users. Several drug classes (MDMA metabolites or analogs, anesthetics, muscle relaxants, amphetamines and stimulants, benzodiazepines, ethanol, opioids), four antidepressants (bupropion, sertraline, venlafaxine and citalopram) and olanzapine demonstrated increased odds ratios for the reported risk of death. Future drug–drug interaction clinical trials should evaluate if any of the other drug–drug interactions described in our results actually pose a risk of morbidity or mortality in controlled medical settings.",Conclusions not available,Traditional ML,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Validating machine learning approaches for prediction of donor related complication in microsurgical breast reconstruction: a retrospective cohort study,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-85155-z,10 Mar 2021,"Autologous reconstruction using abdominal flaps remains the most popular method for breast reconstruction worldwide. We aimed to evaluate a prediction model using machine-learning methods and to determine which factors increase abdominal flap donor site complications with logistic regression. We evaluated the predictive ability of different machine learning packages, reviewing a cohort of breast reconstruction patients who underwent abdominal flaps. We analyzed 13 treatment variables for effects on the abdominal donor site complication rates. To overcome data imbalances, random over sampling example (ROSE) method was used. Data were divided into training and testing sets. Prediction accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and predictive power (AUC) were measured by applying neuralnet, nnet, and RSNNS machine learning packages. A total of 568 patients were analyzed. The supervised learning package that performed the most effective prediction was neuralnet. Factors that significantly affected donor-related complication was size of the fascial defect, history of diabetes, muscle sparing type, and presence or absence of adjuvant chemotherapy. The risk cutoff value for fascial defect was 37.5 cm2. High-risk group complication rates analyzed by statistical method were significant compared to the low-risk group (26% vs 1.7%). These results may help surgeons to achieve better surgical outcomes and reduce postoperative burden.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Predictive model for the 5-year survival status of osteosarcoma patients based on the SEER database and XGBoost algorithm,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-85223-4,10 Mar 2021,"Osteosarcoma is the most common bone malignancy, with the highest incidence in children and adolescents. Survival rate prediction is important for improving prognosis and planning therapy. However, there is still no prediction model with a high accuracy rate for osteosarcoma. Therefore, we aimed to construct an artificial intelligence (AI) model for predicting the 5-year survival of osteosarcoma patients by using extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), a large-scale machine-learning algorithm. We identified cases of osteosarcoma in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Research Database and excluded substandard samples. The study population was 835 and was divided into the training set (n = 668) and validation set (n = 167). Characteristics selected via survival analyses were used to construct the model. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and decision curve analyses were performed to evaluate the prediction. The accuracy of the prediction model was excellent both in the training set (area under the ROC curve [AUC] = 0.977) and the validation set (AUC = 0.911). Decision curve analyses proved the model could be used to support clinical decisions. XGBoost is an effective algorithm for predicting 5-year survival of osteosarcoma patients. Our prediction model had excellent accuracy and is therefore useful in clinical settings.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

We present a direct method that generates readouts for a comprehensive panel of biomarkers from serial whole-brain slices, characterizing all major brain cell types, at scales ranging from subcellular compartments, individual cells, local multi-cellular niches, to whole-brain regions from each slice. We use iterative cycles of optimized 10-plex immunostaining with 10-color epifluorescence imaging to accumulate highly enriched image datasets from individual whole-brain slices, from which seamless signal-corrected mosaics are reconstructed. Specific fluorescent signals of interest are isolated computationally, rejecting autofluorescence, imaging noise, cross-channel bleed-through, and cross-labeling. Reliable large-scale cell detection and segmentation are achieved using deep neural networks. Cell phenotyping is performed by analyzing unique biomarker combinations over appropriate subcellular compartments.

Also, the present study details the data curation process used to extract and match glucose values to insulin therapy. The curation process includes the creation of glucose-insulin pairing rules according to clinical expert-defined physiologic and pharmacologic parameters. Through this approach, it was possible to align nearly 76% of insulin events to a preceding blood glucose reading for nearly 9,600 critically ill patients. This work has the potential to reveal trends in real-world practice for the management of blood glucose.

Comparative analysis of machine learning algorithms for computer-assisted reporting based on fully automated cross-lingual RadLex mappings,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-85016-9,09 Mar 2021,"Computer-assisted reporting (CAR) tools were suggested to improve radiology report quality by context-sensitively recommending key imaging biomarkers. However, studies evaluating machine learning (ML) algorithms on cross-lingual ontological (RadLex) mappings for developing embedded CAR algorithms are lacking. Therefore, we compared ML algorithms developed on human expert-annotated features against those developed on fully automated cross-lingual (German to English) RadLex mappings using 206 CT reports of suspected stroke. Target label was whether the Alberta Stroke Programme Early CT Score (ASPECTS) should have been provided (yes/no:154/52). We focused on probabilistic outputs of ML-algorithms including tree-based methods, elastic net, support vector machines (SVMs) and fastText (linear classifier), which were evaluated in the same 5 × fivefold nested cross-validation framework. This allowed for model stacking and classifier rankings. Performance was evaluated using calibration metrics (AUC, brier score, log loss) and -plots. Contextual ML-based assistance recommending ASPECTS was feasible. SVMs showed the highest accuracies both on human-extracted- (87%) and RadLex features (findings:82.5%; impressions:85.4%). FastText achieved the highest accuracy (89.3%) and AUC (92%) on impressions. Boosted trees fitted on findings had the best calibration profile. Our approach provides guidance for choosing ML classifiers for CAR tools in fully automated and language-agnostic fashion using bag-of-RadLex terms on limited expert-labelled training data.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Identification of primate sensory neuron types is critical for understanding the cellular origin and heritability of chronic pain. However, molecular insights into the primate sensory neurons are missing. Here we classify non-human primate dorsal root ganglion sensory neurons based on their transcriptome and map human pain heritability to neuronal types. First, we identified cell correlates between two major datasets for mouse sensory neuron types. Machine learning exposes an overall cross-species conservation of somatosensory neurons between primate and mouse, although with differences at individual gene level, highlighting the importance of primate data for clinical translation. We map genomic loci associated with chronic pain in human onto primate sensory neuron types to identify the cellular origin of chronic pain. Genome-wide associations for chronic pain converge on two different neuronal types distributed between pain disorders that display different genetic susceptibilities, suggesting both unique and shared mechanisms between different pain conditions.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Using a consensus of multiple machine learning methods, we ranked metabolites based on importance to IBD, followed by virtual ligand-based screening to identify possible human targets and adding evidence from compound assay, differential gene expression, pathway enrichment, and genome-wide association studies. We confirmed known metabolite–target pairs such as nicotinic acid–GPR109a or linoleoyl ethanolamide–GPR119 and inferred interactions of interest including oleanolic acid–GABRG2 and alpha-CEHC–THRB.

Automation of surgical skill assessment using a three-stage machine learning algorithm,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-84295-6,04 Mar 2021,"Surgical skills are associated with clinical outcomes. To improve surgical skills and thereby reduce adverse outcomes, continuous surgical training and feedback is required. Currently, assessment of surgical skills is a manual and time-consuming process which is prone to subjective interpretation. This study aims to automate surgical skill assessment in laparoscopic cholecystectomy videos using machine learning algorithms. To address this, a three-stage machine learning method is proposed: first, a Convolutional Neural Network was trained to identify and localize surgical instruments. Second, motion features were extracted from the detected instrument localizations throughout time. Third, a linear regression model was trained based on the extracted motion features to predict surgical skills. This three-stage modeling approach achieved an accuracy of 87 ± 0.2% in distinguishing good versus poor surgical skill.

Vital signs have traditionally been considered ineffective in pain assessment; nevertheless, the use of machine learning may automate pain assessment using vital signs. This retrospective observational study was performed at a university hospital in Sendai, Japan. Objective pain assessments were performed in eligible patients using the Critical-Care Pain Observation Tool (CPOT). Three machine-learning methods—random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and logistic regression (LR)—were employed to predict pain using parameters, such as vital signs, age group, and sedation levels. Prediction accuracy was calculated as the harmonic mean of sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Furthermore, 117,190 CPOT assessments were performed in 11,507 eligible patients (median age: 65 years; 58.0% males). We found that pain prediction was possible with all three machine-learning methods. RF demonstrated the highest AUROC for the test data (RF: 0.853, SVM: 0.823, and LR: 0.787).

Development of digital measures for nighttime scratch and sleep using wrist-worn wearable devices,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-021-00402-x,03 Mar 2021,"Patients with atopic dermatitis experience increased nocturnal pruritus which leads to scratching and sleep disturbances that significantly contribute to poor quality of life. Objective measurements of nighttime scratching and sleep quantity can help assess the efficacy of an intervention. Wearable sensors can provide novel, objective measures of nighttime scratching and sleep; however, many current approaches were not designed for passive, unsupervised monitoring during daily life. In this work, we present the development and analytical validation of a method that sequentially processes epochs of sample-level accelerometer data from a wrist-worn device to provide continuous digital measures of nighttime scratching and sleep quantity. This approach uses heuristic and machine learning algorithms in a hierarchical paradigm by first determining when the patient intends to sleep, then detecting sleep–wake states along with scratching episodes, and lastly deriving objective measures of both sleep and scratch. Leveraging reference data collected in a sleep laboratory (NCT ID: NCT03490877), results show that sensor-derived measures of total sleep opportunity (TSO; time when patient intends to sleep) and total sleep time (TST) correlate well with reference polysomnography data (TSO: r = 0.72, p < 0.001; TST: r = 0.76, p < 0.001; N = 32). Log transformed sensor derived measures of total scratching duration achieve strong agreement with reference annotated video recordings (r = 0.82, p < 0.001; N = 25).

We retrospectively analyzed clinico-pathologic data from 1040 patients diagnosed with PTC between 2003 and 2009. We analyzed clinico-pathologic factors related to recurrence through logistic regression analysis. Among the factors that we included, only sex and tumor size were significantly correlated with disease recurrence. Parameters such as age, sex, tumor size, tumor multiplicity, ETE, ENE, pT, pN, ipsilateral central LN metastasis, contralateral central LNs metastasis, number of metastatic LNs, and LNR were input for construction of a machine learning prediction model. The performance of five machine learning models related to recurrence prediction was compared based on accuracy. The Decision Tree model showed the best accuracy at 95%, and the lightGBM and stacking model together showed 93% accuracy. Among those factors mentioned above, LNR and contralateral LN metastasis were used as important features in all machine learning prediction models. We confirmed that all machine learning prediction models showed an accuracy of 90% or more for predicting disease recurrence in PTC. LNR and contralateral LN metastasis were used as important features for constructing a robust machine learning prediction model. In the future, we have a plan to perform large-scale multicenter clinical studies to improve the performance of our prediction models and verify their clinical effectiveness.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

We present deep learning models based on the well-known you-only-look-once (YOLO) algorithm. This model can be used to simultaneously classify and localize the images to identify the species of the gender of field-caught mosquitoes. The results indicated that the concatenated two YOLO v3 model exhibited the optimal performance in identifying the mosquitoes, as the mosquitoes were relatively small objects compared with the large proportional environment image. The robustness testing of the proposed model yielded a mean average precision and sensitivity of 99% and 92.4%, respectively. The model exhibited high performance in terms of the specificity and accuracy, with an extremely low rate of misclassification. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.958 ± 0.011, which further demonstrated the model accuracy. Thirteen classes were detected with an accuracy of 100% based on a confusion matrix. Nevertheless, the relatively low detection rates for the two species were likely a result of the limited number of wild-caught biological samples available. The proposed model can help establish the population densities of mosquito vectors in remote areas to predict disease outbreaks in advance.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: ; Attacker Capability: 
Hospitalization and mortality associated with SARS-CoV-2 viral clades in COVID-19,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-82850-9,26 Feb 2021,"The COVID-19 epidemic of 2019–20 is due to the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Following first case description in December, 2019 this virus has infected over 10 million individuals and resulted in at least 500,000 deaths world-wide. The virus is undergoing rapid mutation, with two major clades of sequence variants emerging. This study sought to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 sequence variants are associated with differing outcomes among COVID-19 patients in a single medical system. Whole genome SARS-CoV-2 RNA sequence was obtained from isolates collected from patients registered in the University of Washington Medicine health system between March 1 and April 15, 2020. Demographic and baseline clinical characteristics of patients and their outcome data including their hospitalization and death were collected. Statistical and machine learning models were applied to determine if viral genetic variants were associated with specific outcomes of hospitalization or death. Full length SARS-CoV-2 sequence was obtained 190 subjects with clinical outcome data. 35 (18.4%) were hospitalized and 14 (7.4%) died from complications of infection. A total of 289 single nucleotide variants were identified. Clustering methods demonstrated two major viral clades, which could be readily distinguished by 12 polymorphisms in 5 genes. A trend toward higher rates of hospitalization of patients with Clade 2 infections was observed (p = 0.06, Fisher’s exact). Machine learning models utilizing patient demographics and co-morbidities achieved area-under-the-curve (AUC) values of 0.93 for predicting hospitalization. Addition of viral clade or sequence information did not significantly improve models for outcome prediction. In summary, SARS-CoV-2 shows substantial sequence diversity in a community-based sample. Two dominant clades of virus are in circulation.

Machine learning based predictors for COVID-19 disease severity,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-83967-7,25 Feb 2021,"Predictors of the need for intensive care and mechanical ventilation can help healthcare systems in planning for surge capacity for COVID-19. We used socio-demographic data, clinical data, and blood panel profile data at the time of initial presentation to develop machine learning algorithms for predicting the need for intensive care and mechanical ventilation. Among the algorithms considered, the Random Forest classifier performed the best with \(\text {AUC} = 0.80\) for predicting ICU need and \(\text {AUC} = 0.82\) for predicting the need for mechanical ventilation. We also determined the most influential features in making this prediction, and concluded that all three categories of data are important. We determined the relative importance of blood panel profile data and noted that the AUC dropped by 0.12 units when this data was not included, thus indicating that it provided valuable information in predicting disease severity. Finally, we generated RF predictors with a reduced set of five features that retained the performance of the predictors trained on all features. These predictors, which rely only on quantitative data, are less prone to errors and subjectivity.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Novel diagnostic and therapeutic techniques reveal changed metabolic profiles in recurrent focal segmental glomerulosclerosis,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-83883-w,25 Feb 2021,"Idiopathic forms of Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) are caused by circulating permeability factors, which can lead to early recurrence of FSGS and kidney failure after kidney transplantation. In the past three decades, many research endeavors were undertaken to identify these unknown factors. Even though some potential candidates have been recently discussed in the literature, “the” actual factor remains elusive. Therefore, there is an increased demand in FSGS research for the use of novel technologies that allow us to study FSGS from a yet unexplored angle. Here, we report the successful treatment of recurrent FSGS in a patient after living-related kidney transplantation by removal of circulating factors with CytoSorb apheresis. Interestingly, the classical published circulating factors were all in normal range in this patient but early disease recurrence in the transplant kidney and immediate response to CytoSorb apheresis were still suggestive for pathogenic circulating factors. To proof the functional effects of the patient’s serum on podocytes and the glomerular filtration barrier we used a podocyte cell culture model and a proteinuria model in zebrafish to detect pathogenic effects on the podocytes actin cytoskeleton inducing a functional phenotype and podocyte effacement. We then performed Raman spectroscopy in the < 50 kDa serum fraction, on cultured podocytes treated with the FSGS serum and in kidney biopsies of the same patient at the time of transplantation and at the time of disease recurrence. The analysis revealed changes in podocyte metabolome induced by the FSGS serum as well as in focal glomerular and parietal epithelial cell regions in the FSGS biopsy. Several altered Raman spectra were identified in the fractionated serum and metabolome analysis by mass spectrometry detected lipid profiles in the FSGS serum, which were supported by disturbances in the Raman spectra. Our novel innovative analysis reveals changed lipid metabolome profiles associated with idiopathic FSGS that might reflect a new subtype of the disease.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Recursive ensemble feature selection provides a robust mRNA expression signature for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-83660-9,25 Feb 2021,"Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a chronic disorder characterized by disabling fatigue. Several studies have sought to identify diagnostic biomarkers, with varying results. Here, we innovate this process by combining both mRNA expression and DNA methylation data. We performed recursive ensemble feature selection (REFS) on publicly available mRNA expression data in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 93 ME/CFS patients and 25 healthy controls, and found a signature of 23 genes capable of distinguishing cases and controls. REFS highly outperformed other methods, with an AUC of 0.92. We validated the results on a different platform (AUC of 0.95) and in DNA methylation data obtained from four public studies on ME/CFS (99 patients and 50 controls), identifying 48 gene-associated CpGs that predicted disease status as well (AUC of 0.97). Finally, ten of the 23 genes could be interpreted in the context of the derailed immune system of ME/CFS.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Machine learning approaches for the prediction of bone mineral density by using genomic and phenotypic data of 5130 older men,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-83828-3,24 Feb 2021,"The study aimed to utilize machine learning (ML) approaches and genomic data to develop a prediction model for bone mineral density (BMD) and identify the best modeling approach for BMD prediction. The genomic and phenotypic data of Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study (n = 5130) was analyzed. Genetic risk score (GRS) was calculated from 1103 associated SNPs for each participant after a comprehensive genotype imputation. Data were normalized and divided into a training set (80%) and a validation set (20%) for analysis. Random forest, gradient boosting, neural network, and linear regression were used to develop BMD prediction models separately. Ten-fold cross-validation was used for hyper-parameters optimization. Mean square error and mean absolute error were used to assess model performance. When using GRS and phenotypic covariates as the predictors, all ML models’ performance and linear regression in BMD prediction were similar. However, when replacing GRS with the 1103 individual SNPs in the model, ML models performed significantly better than linear regression (with lasso regularization), and the gradient boosting model performed the best. Our study suggested that ML models, especially gradient boosting, can improve BMD prediction in genomic data.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Development and validation of a reinforcement learning algorithm to dynamically optimize mechanical ventilation in critical care,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-021-00388-6,19 Feb 2021,"The aim of this work was to develop and evaluate the reinforcement learning algorithm VentAI, which is able to suggest a dynamically optimized mechanical ventilation regime for critically-ill patients. We built, validated and tested its performance on 11,943 events of volume-controlled mechanical ventilation derived from 61,532 distinct ICU admissions and tested it on an independent, secondary dataset (200,859 ICU stays; 25,086 mechanical ventilation events). A patient “data fingerprint” of 44 features was extracted as multidimensional time series in 4-hour time steps. We used a Markov decision process, including a reward system and a Q-learning approach, to find the optimized settings for positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) and ideal body weight-adjusted tidal volume (Vt). The observed outcome was in-hospital or 90-day mortality. VentAI reached a significantly increased estimated performance return of 83.3 (primary dataset) and 84.1 (secondary dataset) compared to physicians’ standard clinical care (51.1). The number of recommended action changes per mechanically ventilated patient constantly exceeded those of the clinicians. VentAI chose 202.9% more frequently ventilation regimes with lower Vt (5–7.5 mL/kg), but 50.8% less for regimes with higher Vt (7.5–10 mL/kg). VentAI recommended 29.3% more frequently PEEP levels of 5–7 cm H2O and 53.6% more frequently PEEP levels of 7–9 cmH2O. VentAI avoided high (>55%) FiO2 values (59.8% decrease), while preferring the range of 50–55% (140.3% increase). In conclusion, VentAI provides reproducible high performance by dynamically choosing an optimized, individualized ventilation strategy and thus might be of benefit for critically ill patients.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Deep learning based automated diagnosis of bone metastases with SPECT thoracic bone images,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-83083-6,19 Feb 2021,"SPECT nuclear medicine imaging is widely used for treating, diagnosing, evaluating and preventing various serious diseases. The automated classification of medical images is becoming increasingly important in developing computer-aided diagnosis systems. Deep learning, particularly for the convolutional neural networks, has been widely applied to the classification of medical images. In order to reliably classify SPECT bone images for the automated diagnosis of metastasis on which the SPECT imaging solely focuses, in this paper, we present several deep classifiers based on the deep networks. Specifically, original SPECT images are cropped to extract the thoracic region, followed by a geometric transformation that contributes to augment the original data. We then construct deep classifiers based on the widely used deep networks including VGG, ResNet and DenseNet by fine-tuning their parameters and structures or self-defining new network structures. Experiments on a set of real-world SPECT bone images show that the proposed classifiers perform well in identifying bone metastasis with SPECT imaging. It achieves 0.9807, 0.9900, 0.9830, 0.9890, 0.9802 and 0.9933 for accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, F-1 score and AUC, respectively, on the test samples from the augmented dataset without normalization.","Targeting at the automated diagnosis of bone metastasis in SPECT nuclear medicine domain, in this work, we have developed several deep classifiers based on the famous CNN models to separate the thoracic SPECT bone images into the categories with the automatically extracted features by deep learning models. Specifically, the original SPECT images was preprocessed by using standard image mirroring, translation, and rotation operations, enabling to generate an augmented dataset. Famous CNN models were introduced to develop deep classifiers, which could classify an image by analyzing from the low level to high level features from this image. A set of real-world SPECT bone images were employed to evaluate the trained classifiers. The experimental results have demonstrated that our deep classifiers perform well on classifying thoracic SPECT bone images, with huge potentials to automatically diagnose bone metastasis in SPECT imaging.Our future work is in the following directions. First, a larger number of images of real-world SPECT bone scans will be collected to further evaluate the proposed deep classifiers. Second, we attempt to develop multi-class, multi-disease classifiers to identify lesions of various diseases with SPECT bone images. Finally, we will construct self-defined deep networks, specifically targeting at the automated classification of SPECT bone images for contributing to the current research of medical image analysis.","DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Cellular correlates of gray matter volume changes in magnetic resonance morphometry identified by two-photon microscopy,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-83491-8,19 Feb 2021,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain combined with voxel-based morphometry (VBM) revealed changes in gray matter volume (GMV) in various disorders. However, the cellular basis of GMV changes has remained largely unclear. We correlated changes in GMV with cellular metrics by imaging mice with MRI and two-photon in vivo microscopy at three time points within 12 weeks, taking advantage of age-dependent changes in brain structure. Imaging fluorescent cell nuclei allowed inferences on (i) physical tissue volume as determined from reference spaces outlined by nuclei, (ii) cell density, (iii) the extent of cell clustering, and (iv) the volume of cell nuclei. Our data indicate that physical tissue volume alterations only account for 13.0% of the variance in GMV change. However, when including comprehensive measurements of nucleus volume and cell density, 35.6% of the GMV variance could be explained, highlighting the influence of distinct cellular mechanisms on VBM results.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: ; Attacker Capability: 
Early risk assessment for COVID-19 patients from emergency department data using machine learning,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-83784-y,18 Feb 2021,"Since its emergence in late 2019, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a pandemic with more than 55 million reported cases and 1.3 million estimated deaths worldwide. While epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 have been reported, risk factors underlying the transition from mild to severe disease among patients remain poorly understood. In this retrospective study, we analysed data of 879 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive patients admitted to a two-site NHS Trust hospital in London, England, between January 1st and May 26th, 2020, with a majority of cases occurring in March and April. We extracted anonymised demographic data, physiological clinical variables and laboratory results from electronic healthcare records (EHR) and applied multivariate logistic regression, random forest and extreme gradient boosted trees. To evaluate the potential for early risk assessment, we used data available during patients’ initial presentation at the emergency department (ED) to predict deterioration to one of three clinical endpoints in the remainder of the hospital stay: admission to intensive care, need for invasive mechanical ventilation and in-hospital mortality. Based on the trained models, we extracted the most informative clinical features in determining these patient trajectories. Considering our inclusion criteria, we have identified 129 of 879 (15%) patients that required intensive care, 62 of 878 (7%) patients needing mechanical ventilation, and 193 of 619 (31%) cases of in-hospital mortality. Our models learned successfully from early clinical data and predicted clinical endpoints with high accuracy, the best model achieving area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC-ROC) scores of 0.76 to 0.87 (F1 scores of 0.42–0.60). Younger patient age was associated with an increased risk of receiving intensive care and ventilation, but lower risk of mortality. Clinical indicators of a patient’s oxygen supply and selected laboratory results, such as blood lactate and creatinine levels, were most predictive of COVID-19 patient trajectories. Among COVID-19 patients machine learning can aid in the early identification of those with a poor prognosis, using EHR data collected during a patient’s first presentation at ED. Patient age and measures of oxygenation status during ED stay are primary indicators of poor patient outcomes.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
"Correlation between corneal thickness, keratometry, age, and differential pressure difference in healthy eyes",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-83683-2,18 Feb 2021,"To determine the use of differential pressure difference (DPD), in air-puff differential tonometry, as a potential biomechanical measure of the cornea and elucidate its relationship with the intraocular pressure (IOP), central corneal thickness, corneal curvature, and age. This study comprised 396 eyes from 198 patients and was conducted at Acibadem University, School of Medicine, Department of Ophthalmology, Istanbul, Turkey. The central corneal curvature and refraction of the eyes were measured using an Auto Kerato-Refractometer (KR-1; Topcon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). IOP and central corneal thickness were measured using a tono-pachymeter (CT-1P; Topcon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), wherein two separate readings of IOP were obtained using two different modes: 1–30 and 1–60. The difference between these two readings was recorded as the DPD. The factors affecting the DPD were determined by stepwise multiple linear regression analysis. DPD varied over a dynamic range of − 3.0 to + 5.0 mmHg and was weakly correlated with the central corneal thickness (r = 0.115, p < 0.05). DPD showed no significant correlation with IOP 1–30 (p > 0.05). A weak but statistically significant (p < 0.05) positive correlation of DPD was observed with age (r = 0.123), Kavg (r = 0.102), and the CCT (r = 0.115). There was a significant correlation between DPD and Kavg, CCT, and age. There was no significant correlation between DPD and IOP 1–30. Age-related changes in the corneal ultrastructure may be a plausible explanation for the weak positive association between age and DPD. The proposed method may prove a valid non-invasive tool for the evaluation of corneal biomechanics and introduce DPD in the decision-making of routine clinical practice.","We presented a parameter, DPD, utilized to evaluate the in vivo biomechanical response of normal cornea derived from tono-pachymeter-derived measurements. DPD can be used as a potential parameter following modification of tono-pachymeter software and simply converting the device into a tonopacho-biomechanometer. The usefulness of DPD in determining corneal pathologies is yet to be assessed. However, the method employed to obtain DPD by air-puff tonometry is user-friendly, low cost, and of non-invasive nature. DPD may be an alternative and potentially useful biophysical variable for evaluating ocular bio-properties. Further studies are required to infer what biomechanical properties are delineated by this parameter and propose more clinical applications based on its use.","Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Zero-crossing patterns reveal subtle epileptiform discharges in the scalp EEG,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-83337-3,18 Feb 2021,"Clinical diagnosis of epilepsy depends heavily on the detection of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) from scalp electroencephalographic (EEG) signals, which by purely visual means is far from straightforward. Here, we introduce a simple signal analysis procedure based on scalp EEG zero-crossing patterns which can extract the spatiotemporal structure of scalp voltage fluctuations. We analyzed simultaneous scalp and intracranial EEG recordings from patients with pharmacoresistant temporal lobe epilepsy. Our data show that a large proportion of intracranial IEDs manifest only as subtle, low-amplitude waveforms below scalp EEG background and could, therefore, not be detected visually. We found that scalp zero-crossing patterns allow detection of these intracranial IEDs on a single-trial level with millisecond temporal precision and including some mesial temporal discharges that do not propagate to the neocortex. Applied to an independent dataset, our method discriminated accurately between patients with epilepsy and normal subjects, confirming its practical applicability.",Conclusions not available,Gen AI,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

We identify a flaw, temporal bias, that is specific to and uniquely associated with these studies that occurs when the study period is not representative of the data that clinicians have during the diagnostic process. Temporal bias acts to undermine the validity of predictions by over-emphasizing features close to the outcome of interest. We examine the impact of temporal bias across the medical literature, and highlight examples of exaggerated effect sizes, false-negative predictions, and replication failure. Given the ubiquity and practical advantages of case-control studies, we discuss strategies for estimating the influence of and preventing temporal bias where it exists.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Breath analysis based early gastric cancer classification from deep stacked sparse autoencoder neural network,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-83184-2,17 Feb 2021,"Deep learning is an emerging tool, which is regularly used for disease diagnosis in the medical field. A new research direction has been developed for the detection of early-stage gastric cancer. The computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems reduce the mortality rate due to their effectiveness. In this study, we proposed a new method for feature extraction using a stacked sparse autoencoder to extract the discriminative features from the unlabeled data of breath samples. A Softmax classifier was then integrated to the proposed method of feature extraction, to classify gastric cancer from the breath samples. Precisely, we identified fifty peaks in each spectrum to distinguish the EGC, AGC, and healthy persons. This CAD system reduces the distance between the input and output by learning the features and preserve the structure of the input data set of breath samples. The features were extracted from the unlabeled data of the breath samples. After the completion of unsupervised training, autoencoders with Softmax classifier were cascaded to develop a deep stacked sparse autoencoder neural network. In last, fine-tuning of the developed neural network was carried out with labeled training data to make the model more reliable and repeatable. The proposed deep stacked sparse autoencoder neural network architecture exhibits excellent results, with an overall accuracy of 98.7% for advanced gastric cancer classification and 97.3% for early gastric cancer detection using breath analysis. Moreover, the developed model produces an excellent result for recall, precision, and f score value, making it suitable for clinical application.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Real-time acoustic sensing and artificial intelligence for error prevention in orthopedic surgery,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-83506-4,17 Feb 2021,"In this work, we developed and validated a computer method capable of robustly detecting drill breakthrough events and show the potential of deep learning-based acoustic sensing for surgical error prevention. Bone drilling is an essential part of orthopedic surgery and has a high risk of injuring vital structures when over-drilling into adjacent soft tissue. We acquired a dataset consisting of structure-borne audio recordings of drill breakthrough sequences with custom piezo contact microphones in an experimental setup using six human cadaveric hip specimens. In the following step, we developed a deep learning-based method for the automated detection of drill breakthrough events in a fast and accurate fashion. We evaluated the proposed network regarding breakthrough detection sensitivity and latency. The best performing variant yields a sensitivity of \(93.64 \pm 2.42\)% for drill breakthrough detection in a total execution time of 139.29\({\hbox { ms}}\). The validation and performance evaluation of our solution demonstrates promising results for surgical error prevention by automated acoustic-based drill breakthrough detection in a realistic experiment while being multiple times faster than a surgeon’s reaction time.

Identification of sarcomatoid differentiation in renal cell carcinoma by machine learning on multiparametric MRI,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-83271-4,15 Feb 2021,"Sarcomatoid differentiation in RCC (sRCC) is associated with a poor prognosis, necessitating more aggressive management than RCC without sarcomatoid components (nsRCC). Since suspected renal cell carcinoma (RCC) tumors are not routinely biopsied for histologic evaluation, there is a clinical need for a non-invasive method to detect sarcomatoid differentiation pre-operatively. We utilized unsupervised self-organizing map (SOM) and supervised Learning Vector Quantizer (LVQ) machine learning to classify RCC tumors on T2-weighted, non-contrast T1-weighted fat-saturated, contrast-enhanced arterial-phase T1-weighted fat-saturated, and contrast-enhanced venous-phase T1-weighted fat-saturated MRI images. The SOM was trained on 8 nsRCC and 8 sRCC tumors, and used to compute Activation Maps for each training, validation (3 nsRCC and 3 sRCC), and test (5 nsRCC and 5 sRCC) tumor. The LVQ classifier was trained and optimized on Activation Maps from the 22 training and validation cohort tumors, and tested on Activation Maps of the 10 unseen test tumors. In this preliminary study, the SOM-LVQ model achieved a hold-out testing accuracy of 70% in the task of identifying sarcomatoid differentiation in RCC on standard multiparameter MRI (mpMRI) images. We have demonstrated a combined SOM-LVQ machine learning approach that is suitable for analysis of limited mpMRI datasets for the task of differential diagnosis.","We have demonstrated a Self-Organizing Map based approach for analysis of standard multiparametric MRI images to aid in the task of identifying sarcomatoid differentiation in renal cell carcinoma. Sarcomatoid differentiation is noted in approximately 5–10% of all RCCs, and this relatively uncommon presentation, combined with our requirement for the availability of pre-operative MRIs, restricted the current study to relatively small sample size. The performance of our final model on an independent test dataset, while leaving much room for improvement, points to the promise of this machine learning approach with limited sample sizes. The 2-dimensional “Activation Maps” that are produced as an intermediate output can be visually assessed by the human expert (i.e., Radiologist), which may increase interpretability and acceptability of the machine diagnosis. Our ongoing work is focused on increasing the sample size as well as on increasing the number of mpMRI “channels” to increase the information available to the SOM-LVQ model. Looking ahead, one can envision a hybrid diagnostic approach that combines the objective output of the LVQ classifier on the Activation Map of a given patient’s tumor, with a radiologist’s assessment of T2LIA content 38,39 and peritumoral vascular features 37, to achieve a combined power that is high enough to be clinically useful for diagnosis of sRCC on pre-operative mpMRI images.","Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Inclusion of genetic variants in an ensemble of gradient boosting decision trees does not improve the prediction of citalopram treatment response,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-83338-2,12 Feb 2021,"Identifying in advance who is unlikely to respond to a specific antidepressant treatment is crucial to precision medicine efforts. The current work leverages genome-wide genetic variation and machine learning to predict response to the antidepressant citalopram using data from the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) trial (n = 1257 with both valid genomic and outcome data). A confirmatory approach selected 11 SNPs previously reported to predict response to escitalopram in a sample different from the current study. A novel exploratory approach selected SNPs from across the genome using nested cross-validation with elastic net logistic regression with a predominantly lasso penalty (alpha = 0.99). SNPs from each approach were combined with baseline clinical predictors and treatment response outcomes were predicted using a stacked ensemble of gradient boosting decision trees. Using pre-treatment clinical and symptom predictors only, out-of-fold prediction of a novel treatment response definition based on STAR*D treatment guidelines was acceptable, AUC = .659, 95% CI [0.629, 0.689]. The inclusion of SNPs using confirmatory or exploratory selection methods did not improve the out-of-fold prediction of treatment response (AUCs were .662, 95% CI [0.632, 0.692] and .655, 95% CI [0.625, 0.685], respectively). A similar pattern of results were observed for the secondary outcomes of the presence or absence of distressing side effects regardless of treatment response and achieving remission or satisfactory partial response, assuming medication tolerance.

Heartbeats are decomposed into the five fundamental P, Q, R, S and T waves plus an error term to account for artifacts in the data which provides a meaningful, physical interpretation of the heart’s electric system. The morphology of each wave is concisely described using four parameters that allow all the different patterns in heartbeats to be characterized and thus differentiated This multi-purpose approach solves such questions as the extraction of interpretable features, the detection of the fiducial marks of the fundamental waves, or the generation of synthetic data and the denoising of signals. Yet the greatest benefit from this new discovery will be the automatic diagnosis of heart anomalies as well as other clinical uses with great advantages compared to the rigid, vulnerable and black box machine learning procedures, widely used in medical devices. The paper shows the enormous potential of the method in practice; specifically, the capability to discriminate subjects, characterize morphologies and detect the fiducial marks (reference points) are validated numerically using simulated and real data, thus proving that it outperforms its competitors.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Performance and efficiency of machine learning algorithms for analyzing rectangular biomedical data,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41374-020-00525-x,11 Feb 2021,"Most biomedical datasets, including those of ‘omics, population studies, and surveys, are rectangular in shape and have few missing data. Recently, their sample sizes have grown significantly. Rigorous analyses on these large datasets demand considerably more efficient and more accurate algorithms. Machine learning (ML) algorithms have been used to classify outcomes in biomedical datasets, including random forests (RF), decision tree (DT), artificial neural networks (ANN), and support vector machine (SVM). However, their performance and efficiency in classifying multi-category outcomes of rectangular data are poorly understood. Therefore, we compared these metrics among the 4 ML algorithms. As an example, we created a large rectangular dataset using the female breast cancers in the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results-18 database, which were diagnosed in 2004 and followed up until December 2016. The outcome was the five-category cause of death, namely alive, non-breast cancer, breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, and other cause. We analyzed the 54 dichotomized features from ~45,000 patients using MatLab (version 2018a) and the tenfold cross-validation approach. The accuracy in classifying five-category cause of death with DT, RF, ANN, and SVM was 69.21%, 70.23%, 70.16%, and 69.06%, respectively, which was higher than the accuracy of 68.12% with multinomial logistic regression. Based on the features' information entropy, we optimized dimension reduction (i.e., reduce the number of features in models). We found 32 or more features were required to maintain similar accuracy, while the running time decreased from 55.57 s for 54 features to 25.99 s for 32 features in RF, from 12.92 s to 10.48 s in ANN, and from 175.50 s to 67.81 s in SVM. In summary, we here show that RF, DT, ANN, and SVM had similar accuracy for classifying multi-category outcomes in this large rectangular dataset. Dimension reduction based on information gain will increase the model’s efficiency while maintaining classification accuracy.",Conclusions not available,Traditional ML,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

With the training dataset, MLM was constructed to predict IOP using 35 systemic variables and 25 blood measurements. A DL model was developed to predict IOP from color fundus photographs. The prediction accuracy of each model was evaluated through the absolute error and the marginal R-squared (mR2), using the testing dataset. The mean absolute error with MLM was 2.29 mmHg, which was significantly smaller than that with DL (2.70 dB). The mR2 with MLM was 0.15, whereas that with DL was 0.0066. The mean absolute error (between 2.24 and 2.30 mmHg) and mR2 (between 0.11 and 0.15) with LASSO, SVM and RF were similar to or poorer than MLM. A DL model to predict IOP using color fundus photography proved far less accurate than MLM using systemic variables.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Ensemble machine learning prediction and variable importance analysis of 5-year mortality after cardiac valve and CABG operations,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-82403-0,10 Feb 2021,"Despite having a similar post-operative complication profile, cardiac valve operations are associated with a higher mortality rate compared to coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) operations. For long-term mortality, few predictors are known. In this study, we applied an ensemble machine learning (ML) algorithm to 88 routinely collected peri-operative variables to predict 5-year mortality after different types of cardiac operations. The Super Learner algorithm was trained using prospectively collected peri-operative data from 8241 patients who underwent cardiac valve, CABG and combined operations. Model performance and calibration were determined for all models, and variable importance analysis was conducted for all peri-operative parameters. Results showed that the predictive accuracy was the highest for solitary mitral (0.846 [95% CI 0.812–0.880]) and solitary aortic (0.838 [0.813–0.864]) valve operations, confirming that ensemble ML using routine data collected perioperatively can predict 5-year mortality after cardiac operations with high accuracy. Additionally, post-operative urea was identified as a novel and strong predictor of mortality for several types of operation, having a seemingly additive effect to better known risk factors such as age and postoperative creatinine.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Predictive modeling of clinical trial terminations using feature engineering and embedding learning,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-82840-x,10 Feb 2021,"In this study, we propose to use machine learning to understand terminated clinical trials. Our goal is to answer two fundamental questions: (1) what are common factors/markers associated to terminated clinical trials? and (2) how to accurately predict whether a clinical trial may be terminated or not? The answer to the first question provides effective ways to understand characteristics of terminated trials for stakeholders to better plan their trials; and the answer to the second question can direct estimate the chance of success of a clinical trial in order to minimize costs. By using 311,260 trials to build a testbed with 68,999 samples, we use feature engineering to create 640 features, reflecting clinical trial administration, eligibility, study information, criteria etc. Using feature ranking, a handful of features, such as trial eligibility, trial inclusion/exclusion criteria, sponsor types etc., are found to be related to the clinical trial termination. By using sampling and ensemble learning, we achieve over 67% Balanced Accuracy and over 0.73 AUC (Area Under the Curve) scores to correctly predict clinical trial termination, indicating that machine learning can help achieve satisfactory prediction results for clinical trial study.","In this paper, we used feature engineering and predictive modeling to study key factors associated to clinical trial termination, and proposed a framework to predict trial termination. By using 311,260 clinical trials to build a dataset with 68,999 samples, we achieved over 0.73 AUC and over 67% Balanced Accuracy scores for trial termination prediction. The predictive modeling offers insight for stakeholders to better plan clinical trials to avoid waste and ensure success.A limitation of our research is that the decision logic of the predictive models is not transparent, making it difficult to interpret the predictions. Future work can focus on models with better interpretability. In addition, research can segregate clinical trials into separate groups to determine if concentrated research area trials have more pronounced features or termination results. For example, this study and a previous study found oncology keywords as important features17. A different study has found surgery words as the highest important keyword factor18. Segregating clinical trials on the basis of research or therapeutic area for a single data set may possibly yield improved results for a predictive termination model. In which case, the same methodology could be applied to a subset of clinical trials.","Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

A dynamic lesion model for differentiation of malignant and benign pathologies,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-83095-2,10 Feb 2021,"Malignant lesions have a high tendency to invade their surrounding environment compared to benign ones. This paper proposes a dynamic lesion model and explores the 2nd order derivatives at each image voxel, which reflect the rate of change of image intensity, as a quantitative measure of the tendency. The 2nd order derivatives at each image voxel are usually represented by the Hessian matrix, but it is difficult to quantify a matrix field (or image) through the lesion space as a measure of the tendency. We conjecture that the three eigenvalues contain important information of the Hessian matrix and are chosen as the surrogate representation of the Hessian matrix. By treating the three eigenvalues as a vector, called Hessian vector, which is defined in a local coordinate formed by three orthogonal Hessian eigenvectors and further adapting the gray level occurrence computing method to extract the vector texture descriptors (or measures) from the Hessian vector, a quantitative presentation for the dynamic lesion model is completed. The vector texture descriptors were applied to differentiate malignant from benign lesions from two pathologically proven datasets: colon polyps and lung nodules. The classification results not only outperform four state-of-the-art methods but also three radiologist experts.","A dynamic lesion model was proposed to consider the clinical observation that malignant lesions have a high tendency to invade their surrounding environment compared to benign ones. To mathematically describe the lesion model, one conjecture was made that the lesion growing or invading tendency is related to the rate of image intensity changing at each image voxel, and the rate is represented by the 2nd order derivatives at that voxel, leading to a field of Hessian matrix across the image array space. To circumvent the difficulty of extracting quantitative measures from a matrix field for the task of CADx of lesions, another conjecture was made that the three eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix can be a surrogate representation of the Hessian matrix, and further be treated as a vector in the orthogonal system of the eigenvectors, i.e. Hessian vector.Inspired by the well-known co-occurrence texture measures for the CADx task, we extracted the co-occurrence vector texture features, i.e. VTFs, from the Hessian vector field or image. Classifying the VTFs for the CADx task on two pathologically proven lesion datasets of polyps and nodules provided striking results, outperforming both the state-of-the-art CADx methods and radiologist experts.While the VTF was demonstrated as a good feature descriptor of the dynamic lesion model, other vector feature descriptors can be explored for the CADx task. This is one of our future research topics.While the Hessian vector was demonstrated as a good surrogate of the Hessian matrix, use of the Hessian matrix for generation of matrix feature descriptors for the CADx task is desired. This is another topic of our future research endeavors.More importantly, by the insights on why AlphaGo can outperform the human experts, we believe task-driven AI-enabled CADx systems would be a direction of our future research endeavors40,41,42.It can be seen that the evaluation study of the VTF descriptor for the dynamic lesion model is limited by the small sample size of both the polyp and the nodule datasets. We have been devoting significant effort to continually acquire more pathologically proven lesion datasets, although the data acquisition is highly costly.","DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Unraveling the deep learning gearbox in optical coherence tomography image segmentation towards explainable artificial intelligence,https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-021-01697-y,05 Feb 2021,"Machine learning has greatly facilitated the analysis of medical data, while the internal operations usually remain intransparent. To better comprehend these opaque procedures, a convolutional neural network for optical coherence tomography image segmentation was enhanced with a Traceable Relevance Explainability (T-REX) technique. The proposed application was based on three components: ground truth generation by multiple graders, calculation of Hamming distances among graders and the machine learning algorithm, as well as a smart data visualization (‘neural recording’). An overall average variability of 1.75% between the human graders and the algorithm was found, slightly minor to 2.02% among human graders. The ambiguity in ground truth had noteworthy impact on machine learning results, which could be visualized. The convolutional neural network balanced between graders and allowed for modifiable predictions dependent on the compartment. Using the proposed T-REX setup, machine learning processes could be rendered more transparent and understandable, possibly leading to optimized applications.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Meta-omics characteristics of intestinal microbiota associated to HBeAg seroconversion induced by oral antiviral therapy,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-82939-1,05 Feb 2021,"Tenofovir and entecavir are currently designated as the preferred oral antiviral drugs for chronic hepatitis B. However, only less than 40% of patients can achieve HBeAg seroconversion. We aim at investigating the role of intestinal microbiome in HBeAg seroconversion induced by oral antiviral therapy and describe multi-omics characteristics of HBeAg seroconversion associated intestinal flora. In this study, we prospectively collected fecal samples at baseline from the patients with HBeAg positive chronic hepatitis B who would have oral antiviral therapy. 16S rDNA sequencing and metabolomics were performed. We identified HBeAg seroconversion-related microbial signature and constructed prediction model for HBeAg seroconversion. Thirty-seven of these subjects achieved HBeAg seroconversion within 156 weeks after the initiation of oral antiviral therapy, while 41 subjects remained HBeAg positive even after over 156 weeks of therapy. A computational statistical and machine learning approach allowed us to identify a microbial signature for HBeAg seroconversion. Using random forest method, we further constructed a classifier based on the microbial signature, with area under curve being 0.749 for the test set. Patients who achieved HBeAg seroconversion tended to have lower abundance of certain fecal metabolites such as essential amino acids, and several dipeptides. By analyzing the fecal microbiota from the patients with and without HBeAg seroconversion, we showed intestinal microbiome play a critical role in HBeAg seroconversion induced by oral antiviral therapy. We also identified intestinal microbial signature that is associated with HBeAg seroconversion after oral antiviral therapy.",Conclusions not available,Gen AI,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Epidemiological studies require the establishment of high-quality databases. Several datasets that primarily involve heart failure populations have been established in Western countries and have generated many high-quality studies. However, no such dataset is available from China. Due to differences in genetic background and healthcare systems between China and Western countries, the establishment of a heart failure database for the Chinese population is urgently needed.

Practical prediction model of the clinical response to programmed death-ligand 1 inhibitors in advanced gastric cancer,https://www.nature.com/articles/s12276-021-00559-1,05 Feb 2021,"The identification of predictive biomarkers or models is necessary for the selection of patients who might benefit the most from immunotherapy. Seven histological features (signet ring cell [SRC], fibrous stroma, myxoid stroma, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes [TILs], necrosis, tertiary lymphoid follicles, and ulceration) detected in surgically resected tissues (N = 44) were used to train a model. The presence of SRC became an optimal decision parameter for pathology alone (AUC = 0.78). Analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for the prediction of genomic markers showed that C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 11 (CXCL11) was high in responders (P < 0.001). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed to verify its potential as a biomarker. IHC revealed that the expression of CXCL11 was associated with responsiveness (P = 0.003). The response prediction model was trained by integrating the results of the analysis of pathological factors and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). When trained with the C5.0 decision tree model, the categorical level of the expression of CXCL11, a single variable, was shown to be the best model (AUC = 0.812). The AUC of the model trained with the random forest was 0.944. Survival analysis revealed that the C5.0-trained model (log-rank P = 0.01 for progression-free survival [PFS]; log-rank P = 0.012 for overall survival [OS]) and the random forest-trained model (log-rank P < 0.001 for PFS; log-rank P = 0.001 for OS) predicted prognosis more accurately than the PD-L1 test (log-rank P = 0.031 for PFS; log-rank P = 0.107 for OS).",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Classification of paediatric brain tumours by diffusion weighted imaging and machine learning,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-82214-3,04 Feb 2021,"To determine if apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) can discriminate between posterior fossa brain tumours on a multicentre basis. A total of 124 paediatric patients with posterior fossa tumours (including 55 Medulloblastomas, 36 Pilocytic Astrocytomas and 26 Ependymomas) were scanned using diffusion weighted imaging across 12 different hospitals using a total of 18 different scanners. Apparent diffusion coefficient maps were produced and histogram data was extracted from tumour regions of interest. Total histograms and histogram metrics (mean, variance, skew, kurtosis and 10th, 20th and 50th quantiles) were used as data input for classifiers with accuracy determined by tenfold cross validation. Mean ADC values from the tumour regions of interest differed between tumour types, (ANOVA P < 0.001). A cut off value for mean ADC between Ependymomas and Medulloblastomas was found to be of 0.984 × 10−3 mm2 s−1 with sensitivity 80.8% and specificity 80.0%. Overall classification for the ADC histogram metrics were 85% using Naïve Bayes and 84% for Random Forest classifiers.

A universal molecular prognostic score for gastrointestinal tumors,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41525-021-00172-1,04 Feb 2021,"Colorectal and gastric cancers are a leading cause of cancer deaths in developed countries. Precise estimation of prognosis is important with regard to clinical decision making for individuals with such cancers. We here comprehensively compiled a complete atlas of prognostic genes based on an integrated meta-analysis of one of the largest assembled colorectal cancer cohorts. A simple yet robust machine learning approach was then applied to establish a universal molecular prognostic score (mPS_colon) that relies on the expression status of only 16 genes and which was validated with independent data sets. This score was found to be an independent prognostic indicator in multivariate models including cancer stage, to be valid independent of tumor characteristics or patient ethnicity, and to be also applicable to gastric cancer. We conclude that mPS_colon is a universal prognostic classifier for patients with gastrointestinal cancers and that it should prove informative for optimization of personalized therapy for such patients.",Conclusions not available,Traditional ML,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Applying artificial intelligence to longitudinal imaging analysis of vestibular schwannoma following radiosurgery,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-82665-8,04 Feb 2021,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has been applied with considerable success in the fields of radiology, pathology, and neurosurgery. It is expected that AI will soon be used to optimize strategies for the clinical management of patients based on intensive imaging follow-up. Our objective in this study was to establish an algorithm by which to automate the volumetric measurement of vestibular schwannoma (VS) using a series of parametric MR images following radiosurgery. Based on a sample of 861 consecutive patients who underwent Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) between 1993 and 2008, the proposed end-to-end deep-learning scheme with automated pre-processing pipeline was applied to a series of 1290 MR examinations (T1W+C, and T2W parametric MR images). All of which were performed under consistent imaging acquisition protocols. The relative volume difference (RVD) between AI-based volumetric measurements and clinical measurements performed by expert radiologists were + 1.74%, − 0.31%, − 0.44%, − 0.19%, − 0.01%, and + 0.26% at each follow-up time point, regardless of the state of the tumor (progressed, pseudo-progressed, or regressed). This study outlines an approach to the evaluation of treatment responses via novel volumetric measurement algorithm, and can be used longitudinally following GKRS for VS.

Risk factors analysis of COVID-19 patients with ARDS and prediction based on machine learning,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-82492-x,03 Feb 2021,"COVID-19 is a newly emerging infectious disease, which is generally susceptible to human beings and has caused huge losses to people's health. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is one of the common clinical manifestations of severe COVID-19 and it is also responsible for the current shortage of ventilators worldwide. This study aims to analyze the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 ARDS patients and establish a diagnostic system based on artificial intelligence (AI) method to predict the probability of ARDS in COVID-19 patients. We collected clinical data of 659 COVID-19 patients from 11 regions in China. The clinical characteristics of the ARDS group and no-ARDS group of COVID-19 patients were elaborately compared and both traditional machine learning algorithms and deep learning-based method were used to build the prediction models. Results indicated that the median age of ARDS patients was 56.5 years old, which was significantly older than those with non-ARDS by 7.5 years. Male and patients with BMI > 25 were more likely to develop ARDS. The clinical features of ARDS patients included cough (80.3%), polypnea (59.2%), lung consolidation (53.9%), secondary bacterial infection (30.3%), and comorbidities such as hypertension (48.7%). Abnormal biochemical indicators such as lymphocyte count, CK, NLR, AST, LDH, and CRP were all strongly related to the aggravation of ARDS. Furthermore, through various AI methods for modeling and prediction effect evaluation based on the above risk factors, decision tree achieved the best AUC, accuracy, sensitivity and specificity in identifying the mild patients who were easy to develop ARDS, which undoubtedly helped to deliver proper care and optimize use of limited resources.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Eighty-six patients with GBM were enrolled in the training set after they underwent CCRT or radiotherapy and presented with new or enlarging contrast enhancement within the radiation field on follow-up MRI. A diagnosis was established either pathologically or clinicoradiologically (63 recurrent GBM and 23 RN). Another 41 patients (23 recurrent GBM and 18 RN) from a different institution were enrolled in the test set. Conventional MRI sequences (T2-weighted and postcontrast T1-weighted images) and ADC were analyzed to extract 263 radiomic features. After feature selection, various machine learning models with oversampling methods were trained with combinations of MRI sequences and subsequently validated in the test set. In the independent test set, the model using ADC sequence showed the best diagnostic performance, with an AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity of 0.80, 78%, 66.7%, and 87%, respectively. In conclusion, the radiomics models models using other MRI sequences showed AUCs ranging from 0.65 to 0.66 in the test set.

Data-driven identification of ageing-related diseases from electronic health records,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-82459-y,03 Feb 2021,"Reducing the burden of late-life morbidity requires an understanding of the mechanisms of ageing-related diseases (ARDs), defined as diseases that accumulate with increasing age. This has been hampered by the lack of formal criteria to identify ARDs. Here, we present a framework to identify ARDs using two complementary methods consisting of unsupervised machine learning and actuarial techniques, which we applied to electronic health records (EHRs) from 3,009,048 individuals in England using primary care data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) linked to the Hospital Episode Statistics admitted patient care dataset between 1 April 2010 and 31 March 2015 (mean age 49.7 years (s.d. 18.6), 51% female, 70% white ethnicity). We grouped 278 high-burden diseases into nine main clusters according to their patterns of disease onset, using a hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm. Four of these clusters, encompassing 207 diseases spanning diverse organ systems and clinical specialties, had rates of disease onset that clearly increased with chronological age. However, the ages of onset for these four clusters were strikingly different, with median age of onset 82 years (IQR 82–83) for Cluster 1, 77 years (IQR 75–77) for Cluster 2, 69 years (IQR 66–71) for Cluster 3 and 57 years (IQR 54–59) for Cluster 4. Fitting to ageing-related actuarial models confirmed that the vast majority of these 207 diseases had a high probability of being ageing-related. Cardiovascular diseases and cancers were highly represented, while benign neoplastic, skin and psychiatric conditions were largely absent from the four ageing-related clusters. Our framework identifies and clusters ARDs and can form the basis for fundamental and translational research into ageing pathways.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
An open source machine learning framework for efficient and transparent systematic reviews,https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-020-00287-7,01 Feb 2021,"To help researchers conduct a systematic review or meta-analysis as efficiently and transparently as possible, we designed a tool to accelerate the step of screening titles and abstracts. For many tasks—including but not limited to systematic reviews and meta-analyses—the scientific literature needs to be checked systematically. Scholars and practitioners currently screen thousands of studies by hand to determine which studies to include in their review or meta-analysis. This is error prone and inefficient because of extremely imbalanced data: only a fraction of the screened studies is relevant. The future of systematic reviewing will be an interaction with machine learning algorithms to deal with the enormous increase of available text. We therefore developed an open source machine learning-aided pipeline applying active learning: ASReview. We demonstrate by means of simulation studies that active learning can yield far more efficient reviewing than manual reviewing while providing high quality. Furthermore, we describe the options of the free and open source research software and present the results from user experience tests.

Importantly, we demonstrate that the breathprint identified an additional nine of eleven patients who had unconfirmed clinical TB and whose symptoms improved while treated for TB. While more work is necessary to validate the utility of using patient breath to diagnose pediatric TB, it shows promise as a triage instrument or paired as part of an aggregate diagnostic scheme.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Synthetic skull bone defects for automatic patient-specific craniofacial implant design,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-021-00806-0,29 Jan 2021,"Patient-specific craniofacial implants are used to repair skull bone defects after trauma or surgery. Currently, cranial implants are designed and produced by third-party suppliers, which is usually time-consuming and expensive. Recent advances in additive manufacturing made the in-hospital or in-operation-room fabrication of personalized implants feasible. However, the implants are still manufactured by external companies. To facilitate an optimized workflow, fast and automatic implant manufacturing is highly desirable. Data-driven approaches, such as deep learning, show currently great potential towards automatic implant design. However, a considerable amount of data is needed to train such algorithms, which is, especially in the medical domain, often a bottleneck. Therefore, we present CT-imaging data of the craniofacial complex from 24 patients, in which we injected various artificial cranial defects, resulting in 240 data pairs and 240 corresponding implants. Based on this work, automatic implant design and manufacturing processes can be trained.

Time-ordered comorbidity correlations identify patients at risk of mis- and overdiagnosis,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-021-00382-y,29 Jan 2021,"Diagnostic errors are common and can lead to harmful treatments. We present a data-driven, generic approach for identifying patients at risk of being mis- or overdiagnosed, here exemplified by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It has been estimated that 5–60% of all COPD cases are misdiagnosed. High-throughput methods are therefore needed in this domain. We have used a national patient registry, which contains hospital diagnoses for 6.9 million patients across the entire Danish population for 21 years and identified statistically significant disease trajectories for COPD patients. Using 284,154 patients diagnosed with COPD, we identified frequent disease trajectories comprising time-ordered comorbidities. Interestingly, as many as 42,459 patients did not present with these time-ordered, common comorbidities. Comparison of the individual disease history for each non-follower to the COPD trajectories, demonstrated that 9597 patients were unusual. Survival analysis showed that this group died significantly earlier than COPD patients following a trajectory. Out of the 9597 patients, we identified one subgroup comprising 2185 patients at risk of misdiagnosed COPD without the typical events of COPD patients. In all, 10% of these patients were diagnosed with lung cancer, and it seems likely that they are underdiagnosed for lung cancer as their laboratory test values and survival pattern are similar to such patients. Furthermore, only 4% had a lung function test to confirm the COPD diagnosis. Another subgroup with 2368 patients were found to be at risk of “classically” overdiagnosed COPD that survive >5.5 years after the COPD diagnosis, but without the typical complications of COPD.",Conclusions not available,Traditional ML,Attack Types: poisoning; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Present study aimed to explore the long-term effects that GM-IVH have on hippocampal subfields, and their correlates with memory. The sample consisted of 58 participants, including 36 preterm-born (16 with GM-IVH and 20 without neonatal brain injury), and 22 full-term children aged between 6 and 15 years old. All participants underwent a cognitive assessment and magnetic resonance imaging study. GM-IVH children evidenced lower scores in Full Intelligence Quotient and memory measures compared to their low-risk preterm and full-term peers. High-risk preterm children with GM-IVH evidenced significantly lower total hippocampal volumes bilaterally and hippocampal subfield volumes compared to both low-risk preterm and full-term groups. Finally, significant positive correlations between memory and hippocampal subfield volumes were only found in preterm participants together; memory and the right CA-field correlation remained significant after Bonferroni correction was applied (p = .002). In conclusion, memory alterations and both global and regional volumetric reductions in the hippocampus were found to be specifically related to a preterm sample with GM-IVH. Nevertheless, results also suggest that prematurity per se has a long-lasting impact on the association between the right CA-field volume and memory during childhood.",Conclusions not available,Traditional ML,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: ; Attacker Capability:

This study focused on characterizing the entire VF ECM in length and depth with optical imaging. A quantitative morphometric evaluation of the human vocal fold lamina propria using two-photon excitation fluorescence (TPEF), second harmonic generation (SHG), and optical coherence tomography (OCT) was investigated. Fibrillar morphological features, such as fiber diameter, orientation, anisotropy, waviness and second-order statistics features were evaluated and compared according to their spatial distribution. The evidence acquired in this study suggests that the VF ECM is not a strict discrete three-layer structure as traditionally described but instead a continuous assembly of different fibrillar arrangement anchored by predominant collagen transitions zones. We demonstrated that the ECM composition is distinct and markedly thinned in the anterior one-third of itself, which may play a role in the development of some laryngeal diseases. We further examined and extracted the relationship between OCT and multiphoton imaging, promoting correspondences that could lead to accurate 3D mapping of the VF architecture in real-time during phonosurgeries. As miniaturization of optical probes is consistently improving, a clinical translation of OCT imaging and multiphoton imaging, with valuable qualitative and quantitative features, may have significant implications for treating voice disorders.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
"Inhibition of mitochondrial function by metformin increases glucose uptake, glycolysis and GDF-15 release from intestinal cells",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-81349-7,28 Jan 2021,"Even though metformin is widely used to treat type2 diabetes, reducing glycaemia and body weight, the mechanisms of action are still elusive. Recent studies have identified the gastrointestinal tract as an important site of action. Here we used intestinal organoids to explore the effects of metformin on intestinal cell physiology. Bulk RNA-sequencing analysis identified changes in hexose metabolism pathways, particularly glycolytic genes. Metformin increased expression of Slc2a1 (GLUT1), decreased expression of Slc2a2 (GLUT2) and Slc5a1 (SGLT1) whilst increasing GLUT-dependent glucose uptake and glycolytic rate as observed by live cell imaging of genetically encoded metabolite sensors and measurement of oxygen consumption and extracellular acidification rates. Metformin caused mitochondrial dysfunction and metformin’s effects on 2D-cultures were phenocopied by treatment with rotenone and antimycin-A, including upregulation of GDF15 expression, previously linked to metformin dependent weight loss. Gene expression changes elicited by metformin were replicated in 3D apical-out organoids and distal small intestines of metformin treated mice. We conclude that metformin affects glucose uptake, glycolysis and GDF-15 secretion, likely downstream of the observed mitochondrial dysfunction. This may explain the effects of metformin on intestinal glucose utilisation and food balance.",Conclusions not available,Gen AI,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Using machine learning improves predictions of herd-level bovine tuberculosis breakdowns in Great Britain,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-81716-4,26 Jan 2021,"In the United Kingdom, despite decades of control efforts, bovine tuberculosis (bTB) has not been controlled and currently costs ~ £100 m annually. Critical in the failure of control efforts has been the lack of a sufficiently sensitive diagnostic test. Here we use machine learning (ML) to predict herd-level bTB breakdowns in Great Britain (GB) with the aim of improving herd-level diagnostic sensitivity. The results of routinely-collected herd-level tests were correlated with risk factor data. Four ML methods were independently trained with data from 2012–2014 including ~ 4700 positive herd-level test results annually. The best model’s performance was compared to the observed sensitivity and specificity of the herd-level test calculated on the 2015 data resulting in an increased herd-level sensitivity from 61.3 to 67.6% (95% confidence interval (CI): 66.4–68.8%) and herd-level specificity from 90.5 to 92.3% (95% CI: 91.6–93.1%).

Predicting the central 10 degrees visual field in glaucoma by applying a deep learning algorithm to optical coherence tomography images,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-79494-6,26 Jan 2021,"We aimed to develop a model to predict visual field (VF) in the central 10 degrees in patients with glaucoma, by training a convolutional neural network (CNN) with optical coherence tomography (OCT) images and adjusting the values with Humphrey Field Analyzer (HFA) 24–2 test. The training dataset included 558 eyes from 312 glaucoma patients and 90 eyes from 46 normal subjects. The testing dataset included 105 eyes from 72 glaucoma patients. All eyes were analyzed by the HFA 10-2 test and OCT; eyes in the testing dataset were additionally analyzed by the HFA 24-2 test. During CNN model training, the total deviation (TD) values of the HFA 10-2 test point were predicted from the combined OCT-measured macular retinal layers’ thicknesses. Then, the predicted TD values were corrected using the TD values of the innermost four points from the HFA 24-2 test. Mean absolute error derived from the CNN models ranged between 9.4 and 9.5 B. These values reduced to 5.5 dB on average, when the data were corrected using the HFA 24-2 test. In conclusion, HFA 10-2 test results can be predicted with a OCT images using a trained CNN model with adjustment using HFA 24-2 test.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
The impact of tinnitus distress on cognition,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-81728-0,26 Jan 2021,"Tinnitus is the chronic perception of a phantom sound with different levels of related distress. Past research has elucidated interactions of tinnitus distress with audiological, affective and further clinical variables. The influence of tinnitus distress on cognition is underinvestigated. Our study aims at investigating specific influences of tinnitus distress and further associated predictors on cognition in a cohort of n = 146 out-ward clinical tinnitus patients. Age, educational level, hearing loss, Tinnitus Questionnaire (TQ) score, tinnitus duration, speech in noise (SIN), stress, anxiety and depression, and psychological well-being were included as predictors of a machine learning regression approach (elastic net) in three models with scores of a multiple choice vocabulary test (MWT-B), or two trail-making tests (TMT-A and TMT-B), as dependent variables. TQ scores predicted lower MWT-B scores and higher TMT-B test completion time. Stress, emotional, and psychological variables were not found to be relevant predictors in all models with the exception of small positive influences of SIN and depression on TMT-B. Effect sizes were small to medium for all models and predictors. Results are indicative of specific influence of tinnitus distress on cognitive performance, especially on general or crystallized intelligence and executive functions. More research is needed at the delicate intersection of tinnitus distress and cognitive skills needed in daily functioning.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Stress testing reveals gaps in clinic readiness of image-based diagnostic artificial intelligence models,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-020-00380-6,21 Jan 2021,"Artificial intelligence models match or exceed dermatologists in melanoma image classification. Less is known about their robustness against real-world variations, and clinicians may incorrectly assume that a model with an acceptable area under the receiver operating characteristic curve or related performance metric is ready for clinical use. Here, we systematically assessed the performance of dermatologist-level convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on real-world non-curated images by applying computational “stress tests”. Our goal was to create a proxy environment in which to comprehensively test the generalizability of off-the-shelf CNNs developed without training or evaluation protocols specific to individual clinics. We found inconsistent predictions on images captured repeatedly in the same setting or subjected to simple transformations (e.g., rotation). Such transformations resulted in false positive or negative predictions for 6.5–22% of skin lesions across test datasets. Our findings indicate that models meeting conventionally reported metrics need further validation with computational stress tests to assess clinic readiness.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

To define the long-term effects of such a vaccine, we evaluated the clinical outcome and circulating immune responses of eight patients with surgically resected stage IIIB/C or IVM1a/b melanoma, at a median of almost 4 years after treatment with NeoVax, a long-peptide vaccine targeting up to 20 personal neoantigens per patient (NCT01970358). All patients were alive and six were without evidence of active disease. We observed long-term persistence of neoantigen-specific T cell responses following vaccination, with ex vivo detection of neoantigen-specific T cells exhibiting a memory phenotype. We also found diversification of neoantigen-specific T cell clones over time, with emergence of multiple T cell receptor clonotypes exhibiting distinct functional avidities. Furthermore, we detected evidence of tumor infiltration by neoantigen-specific T cell clones after vaccination and epitope spreading, suggesting on-target vaccine-induced tumor cell killing. Personal neoantigen peptide vaccines thus induce T cell responses that persist over years and broaden the spectrum of tumor-specific cytotoxicity in patients with melanoma.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Predictors of change in suicidal ideation across treatment phases of major depressive disorder: analysis of the STAR*D data,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41386-020-00953-9,21 Jan 2021,"The effects of common antidepressants on suicidal ideation (SI) is unclear. In the landmark STAR*D trial antidepressants were effective for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) in early treatment phases, but less effective in later phases. The effects of antidepressants on SI across the entire sample of the STAR*D trial has never been investigated. We performed a secondary analysis of the STAR*D data with the primary outcome of change in score on the suicide item (item three) of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD17) across all four study levels. We used descriptive statistics and logistic regression analyses. Pearson correlation was used for change in SI versus change in depression (HRSD16). Reduction in mean (SD) SI was greater in levels one: 0.29 (±0.78) (p < 0.001) and two: 0.26 (±0.88) (p < 0.001) than in levels three: 0.16 (±0.92) (p = 0.005) and four: 0.18 (±0.93) (p = 0.094). A history of past suicide attempts (OR 1.72, p = 0.007), comorbid medical illness (OR 2.23, p = 0.005), and a family history of drug abuse (OR 1.69, p = 0.008) were correlated with worsening of SI across level one. Treatment with bupropion (OR 0.24, p < 0.001) or buspirone (OR 0.24, p = 0.001) were correlated with lowering of SI across level two. Improvement in SI was correlated with improvement in overall depression (HRSD16) at level one: r(3756) = 0.48; level two: r(1027) = 0.38; level three: r(249) = 0.31; and level four: r(75) = 0.42 (p < 0.001 for all levels). Improvement in SI is limited with pharmacotherapy in patients with treatment-resistant depression.

Impaired meningeal lymphatic drainage in patients with idiopathic Parkinson’s disease,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-01198-1,18 Jan 2021,"Animal studies implicate meningeal lymphatic dysfunction in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, there is no direct evidence in humans to support this role1,2,3,4,5. In this study, we used dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging to assess meningeal lymphatic flow in cognitively normal controls and patients with idiopathic PD (iPD) or atypical Parkinsonian (AP) disorders. We found that patients with iPD exhibited significantly reduced flow through the meningeal lymphatic vessels (mLVs) along the superior sagittal sinus and sigmoid sinus, as well as a notable delay in deep cervical lymph node perfusion, compared to patients with AP. There was no significant difference in the size (cross-sectional area) of mLVs in patients with iPD or AP versus controls. In mice injected with α-synuclein (α-syn) preformed fibrils, we showed that the emergence of α-syn pathology was followed by delayed meningeal lymphatic drainage, loss of tight junctions among meningeal lymphatic endothelial cells and increased inflammation of the meninges. Finally, blocking flow through the mLVs in mice treated with α-syn preformed fibrils increased α-syn pathology and exacerbated motor and memory deficits. These results suggest that meningeal lymphatic drainage dysfunction aggravates α-syn pathology and contributes to the progression of PD.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

The Feature Ambiguity Mitigate Operator model helps improve bone fracture detection on X-ray radiograph,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-81236-1,15 Jan 2021,"This study was performed to propose a method, the Feature Ambiguity Mitigate Operator (FAMO) model, to mitigate feature ambiguity in bone fracture detection on radiographs of various body parts. A total of 9040 radiographic studies were extracted. These images were classified into several body part types including 1651 hand, 1302 wrist, 406 elbow, 696 shoulder, 1580 pelvic, 948 knee, 1180 ankle, and 1277 foot images. Instance segmentation was annotated by radiologists. The ResNext-101+FPN was employed as the baseline network structure and the FAMO model for processing. The proposed FAMO model and other ablative models were tested on a test set of 20% total radiographs in a balanced body part distribution. To the per-fracture extent, an AP (average precision) analysis was performed. For per-image and per-case, the sensitivity, specificity, and AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) were analyzed. At the per-fracture level, the controlled experiment set the baseline AP to 76.8% (95% CI: 76.1%, 77.4%), and the major experiment using FAMO as a preprocessor improved the AP to 77.4% (95% CI: 76.6%, 78.2%). At the per-image level, the sensitivity, specificity, and AUC were 61.9% (95% CI: 58.7%, 65.0%), 91.5% (95% CI: 89.5%, 93.3%), and 74.9% (95% CI: 74.1%, 75.7%), respectively, for the controlled experiment, and 64.5% (95% CI: 61.3%, 67.5%), 92.9% (95% CI: 91.0%, 94.5%), and 77.5% (95% CI: 76.5%, 78.5%), respectively, for the experiment with FAMO.

Prediction of short-term antidepressant response using probabilistic graphical models with replication across multiple drugs and treatment settings,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41386-020-00943-x,15 Jan 2021,"Heterogeneity in the clinical presentation of major depressive disorder and response to antidepressants limits clinicians’ ability to accurately predict a specific patient’s eventual response to therapy. Validated depressive symptom profiles may be an important tool for identifying poor outcomes early in the course of treatment. To derive these symptom profiles, we first examined data from 947 depressed subjects treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) to delineate the heterogeneity of antidepressant response using probabilistic graphical models (PGMs). We then used unsupervised machine learning to identify specific depressive symptoms and thresholds of improvement that were predictive of antidepressant response by 4 weeks for a patient to achieve remission, response, or nonresponse by 8 weeks. Four depressive symptoms (depressed mood, guilt feelings and delusion, work and activities and psychic anxiety) and specific thresholds of change in each at 4 weeks predicted eventual outcome at 8 weeks to SSRI therapy with an average accuracy of 77% (p = 5.5E-08). The same four symptoms and prognostic thresholds derived from patients treated with SSRIs correctly predicted outcomes in 72% (p = 1.25E-05) of 1996 patients treated with other antidepressants in both inpatient and outpatient settings in independent publicly-available datasets. These predictive accuracies were higher than the accuracy of 53% for predicting SSRI response achieved using approaches that (i) incorporated only baseline clinical and sociodemographic factors, or (ii) used 4-week nonresponse status to predict likely outcomes at 8 weeks. The present findings suggest that PGMs providing interpretable predictions have the potential to enhance clinical treatment of depression and reduce the time burden associated with trials of ineffective antidepressants.

The participants in this case–control study included hospitalized older adults with acute conditions who had falls during their hospital stay (case group) and 410 hospitalized older adults who did not experience falls (control group). Data on medical history, fall risk assessment (Morse Fall Scale; MFS), medications, and laboratory results were obtained. Conditional logistic regression analysis was performed to estimate the association between clinical factors and falls. Receiver operating characteristic curves and area under the curve (AUC) were used to determine whether clinical factors could discriminate between fallers and controls. We evaluated three models: (M1) MFS, (M2) M1 plus age, sex, ward, and polypharmacy, and (M3) M2 plus clinical factors. Patients with diabetes mellitus or MFS scores ≥ 45 had the highest risk of falls. Calcium channel blockers, diuretics, anticonvulsants, and benzodiazepines were associated with high fall risk. The AUC of the three models was 0.615, 0.646, and 0.725, respectively (M1 vs. M2, P = 0.042 and M2 vs. M3, P < .001).

G-computation and machine learning for estimating the causal effects of binary exposure statuses on binary outcomes,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-81110-0,14 Jan 2021,"In clinical research, there is a growing interest in the use of propensity score-based methods to estimate causal effects. G-computation is an alternative because of its high statistical power. Machine learning is also increasingly used because of its possible robustness to model misspecification. In this paper, we aimed to propose an approach that combines machine learning and G-computation when both the outcome and the exposure status are binary and is able to deal with small samples. We evaluated the performances of several methods, including penalized logistic regressions, a neural network, a support vector machine, boosted classification and regression trees, and a super learner through simulations. We proposed six different scenarios characterised by various sample sizes, numbers of covariates and relationships between covariates, exposure statuses, and outcomes. We have also illustrated the application of these methods, in which they were used to estimate the efficacy of barbiturates prescribed during the first 24 h of an episode of intracranial hypertension. In the context of GC, for estimating the individual outcome probabilities in two counterfactual worlds, we reported that the super learner tended to outperform the other approaches in terms of both bias and variance, especially for small sample sizes. The support vector machine performed well, but its mean bias was slightly higher than that of the super learner. In the investigated scenarios, G-computation associated with the super learner was a performant method for drawing causal inferences, even from small sample sizes.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Inferred retinal sensitivity in recessive Stargardt disease using machine learning,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-80766-4,14 Jan 2021,"Spatially-resolved retinal function can be measured by psychophysical testing like fundus-controlled perimetry (FCP or ‘microperimetry’). It may serve as a performance outcome measure in emerging interventional clinical trials for macular diseases as requested by regulatory agencies. As FCP constitute laborious examinations, we have evaluated a machine-learning-based approach to predict spatially-resolved retinal function (’inferred sensitivity’) based on microstructural imaging (obtained by spectral domain optical coherence tomography) and patient data in recessive Stargardt disease. Using nested cross-validation, prediction accuracies of (mean absolute error, MAE [95% CI]) 4.74 dB [4.48–4.99] were achieved. After additional inclusion of limited FCP data, the latter reached 3.89 dB [3.67–4.10] comparable to the test–retest MAE estimate of 3.51 dB [3.11–3.91]. Analysis of the permutation importance revealed, that the IS&OS and RPE thickness were the most important features for the prediction of retinal sensitivity. ’Inferred sensitivity’, herein, enables to accurately estimate differential effects of retinal microstructure on spatially-resolved function in Stargardt disease, and might be used as quasi-functional surrogate marker for a refined and time-efficient investigation of possible functionally relevant treatment effects or disease progression.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Twenty-eight patients with temporal lobe epilepsy underwent pre- and postoperative MRI (T1-MPRAGE and Diffusion Tensor Imaging) as well as kinetic perimetry according to Goldmann standard. We probed for whole-brain gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) correlates of VFD using voxel-based morphometry and tract-based spatial statistics, respectively. We furthermore reconstructed individual structural connectomes and conducted local and global network analyses. Two clusters in the bihemispheric middle temporal gyri indicated a postsurgical GM volume decrease with increasing VFD severity (FWE-corrected p < 0.05). A single WM cluster showed a fractional anisotropy decrease with increasing severity of VFD in the ipsilesional optic radiation (FWE-corrected p < 0.05). Furthermore, patients with (vs. without) VFD showed a higher number of postoperative local connectivity changes. Neither in the GM, WM, nor in network metrics we found preoperative correlates of VFD severity.

We developed a random forest (RF) model that predicts pediatric mortality within 72 h of ICU admission, evaluated its performance, and compared it with the Pediatric Index of Mortality 3 (PIM 3). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of RF model was 0.942 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.912–0.972) in the derivation cohort and 0.906 (95% CI = 0.900–0.912) in the validation cohort. In contrast, the AUROC of PIM 3 was 0.892 (95% CI = 0.878–0.906) in the derivation cohort and 0.845 (95% CI = 0.817–0.873) in the validation cohort.

Personalized treatment options for chronic diseases using precision cohort analytics,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-80967-5,13 Jan 2021,"To support point-of-care decision making by presenting outcomes of past treatment choices for cohorts of similar patients based on observational data from electronic health records (EHRs), a machine-learning precision cohort treatment option (PCTO) workflow consisting of (1) data extraction, (2) similarity model training, (3) precision cohort identification, and (4) treatment options analysis was developed. The similarity model is used to dynamically create a cohort of similar patients, to inform clinical decisions about an individual patient. The workflow was implemented using EHR data from a large health care provider for three different highly prevalent chronic diseases: hypertension (HTN), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and hyperlipidemia (HL). A retrospective analysis demonstrated that treatment options with better outcomes were available for a majority of cases (75%, 74%, 85% for HTN, T2DM, HL, respectively). The models for HTN and T2DM were deployed in a pilot study with primary care physicians using it during clinic visits. A novel data-analytic workflow was developed to create patient-similarity models that dynamically generate personalized treatment insights at the point-of-care. By leveraging both knowledge-driven treatment guidelines and data-driven EHR data, physicians can incorporate real-world evidence in their medical decision-making process when considering treatment options for individual patients.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Age-group determination of living individuals using first molar images based on artificial intelligence,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-80182-8,13 Jan 2021,"Dental age estimation of living individuals is difficult and challenging, and there is no consensus method in adults with permanent dentition. Thus, we aimed to provide an accurate and robust artificial intelligence (AI)-based diagnostic system for age-group estimation by incorporating a convolutional neural network (CNN) using dental X-ray image patches of the first molars extracted via panoramic radiography. The data set consisted of four first molar images from the right and left sides of the maxilla and mandible of each of 1586 individuals across all age groups, which were extracted from their panoramic radiographs. The accuracy of the tooth-wise estimation was 89.05 to 90.27%. Performance accuracy was evaluated mainly using a majority voting system and area under curve (AUC) scores. The AUC scores ranged from 0.94 to 0.98 for all age groups, which indicates outstanding capacity. The learned features of CNNs were visualized as a heatmap, and revealed that CNNs focus on differentiated anatomical parameters, including tooth pulp, alveolar bone level, or interdental space, depending on the age and location of the tooth. With this, we provided a deeper understanding of the most informative regions distinguished by age groups. The prediction accuracy and heat map analyses support that this AI-based age-group determination model is plausible and useful.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Prediction of lithium response using genomic data,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-80814-z,13 Jan 2021,"Predicting lithium response prior to treatment could both expedite therapy and avoid exposure to side effects. Since lithium responsiveness may be heritable, its predictability based on genomic data is of interest. We thus evaluate the degree to which lithium response can be predicted with a machine learning (ML) approach using genomic data. Using the largest existing genomic dataset in the lithium response literature (n = 2210 across 14 international sites; 29% responders), we evaluated the degree to which lithium response could be predicted based on 47,465 genotyped single nucleotide polymorphisms using a supervised ML approach. Under appropriate cross-validation procedures, lithium response could be predicted to above-chance levels in two constituent sites (Halifax, Cohen’s kappa 0.15, 95% confidence interval, CI [0.07, 0.24]; and Würzburg, kappa 0.2 [0.1, 0.3]). Variants with shared importance in these models showed over-representation of postsynaptic membrane related genes. Lithium response was not predictable in the pooled dataset (kappa 0.02 [− 0.01, 0.04]), although non-trivial performance was achieved within a restricted dataset including only those patients followed prospectively (kappa 0.09 [0.04, 0.14]). Genomic classification of lithium response remains a promising but difficult task. Classification performance could potentially be improved by further harmonization of data collection procedures.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
"Pro-inflammatory cytokine polymorphisms and interactions with dietary alcohol and estrogen, risk factors for invasive breast cancer using a post genome-wide analysis for gene–gene and gene–lifestyle interaction",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-80197-1,13 Jan 2021,"Molecular and genetic immune-related pathways connected to breast cancer and lifestyles in postmenopausal women are not fully characterized. In this study, we explored the role of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in those pathways at the genome-wide level. With single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the biomarkers and lifestyles together, we further constructed risk profiles to improve predictability for breast cancer. Our earlier genome-wide association gene-environment interaction study used large cohort data from the Women’s Health Initiative Database for Genotypes and Phenotypes Study and identified 88 SNPs associated with CRP and IL-6. For this study, we added an additional 68 SNPs from previous GWA studies, and together with 48 selected lifestyles, evaluated for the association with breast cancer risk via a 2-stage multimodal random survival forest and generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction methods. Overall and in obesity strata (by body mass index, waist, waist-to-hip ratio, exercise, and dietary fat intake), we identified the most predictive genetic and lifestyle variables. Two SNPs (SALL1 rs10521222 and HLA-DQA1 rs9271608) and lifestyles, including alcohol intake, lifetime cumulative exposure to estrogen, and overall and visceral obesity, are the most common and strongest predictive markers for breast cancer across the analyses. The risk profile that combined those variables presented their synergistic effect on the increased breast cancer risk in a gene–lifestyle dose-dependent manner. Our study may contribute to improved predictability for breast cancer and suggest potential interventions for the women with the risk genotypes and lifestyles to reduce their breast cancer risk.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
On the information hidden in a classifier distribution,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-79548-9,13 Jan 2021,"Classification tasks are a common challenge to every field of science. To correctly interpret the results provided by a classifier, we need to know the performance indices of the classifier including its sensitivity, specificity, the most appropriate cut-off value (for continuous classifiers), etc. Typically, several studies should be conducted to find all these indices. Herein, we show that they already exist, hidden in the distribution of the variable used to classify, and can readily be harvested. An educated guess about the distribution of the variable used to classify in each class would help us to decompose the frequency distribution of the variable in population into its components—the probability density function of the variable in each class. Based on the harvested parameters, we can then calculate the performance indices of the classifier. As a case study, we applied the technique to the relative frequency distribution of prostate-specific antigen, a biomarker commonly used in medicine for the diagnosis of prostate cancer. We used nonlinear curve fitting to decompose the variable relative frequency distribution into the probability density functions of the non-diseased and diseased people. The functions were then used to determine the performance indices of the classifier. Sensitivity, specificity, the most appropriate cut-off value, and likelihood ratios were calculated. The reference range of the biomarker and the prevalence of prostate cancer for various age groups were also calculated. The indices obtained were in good agreement with the values reported in previous studies. All these were done without being aware of the real health status of the individuals studied. The method is even applicable for conditions with no definite definitions (e.g., hypertension). We believe the method has a wide range of applications in many scientific fields.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
The association of Coronavirus Disease-19 mortality and prior bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccination: a robust ecological analysis using unsupervised machine learning,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-80787-z,12 Jan 2021,"Population-level data have suggested that bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination may lessen the severity of Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) prompting clinical trials in this area. Some reports have demonstrated conflicting results. We performed a robust, ecologic analysis comparing COVID-19 related mortality (CRM) between strictly selected countries based on BCG vaccination program status utilizing publicly available databases and machine learning methods to define the association between active BCG vaccination programs and CRM. Validation was performed using linear regression and country-specific modeling. CRM was lower for the majority of countries with a BCG vaccination policy for at least the preceding 15 years (BCG15). CRM increased significantly for each increase in the percent population over age 65. A higher total population of a country and BCG15 were significantly associated with improved CRM. There was a consistent association between countries with a BCG vaccination for the preceding 15 years, but not other vaccination programs, and CRM. BCG vaccination programs continued to be associated with decreased CRM even for populations < 40 years old where CRM events are less frequent.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Evaluation of wavelength ranges and tissue depth probed by diffuse reflectance spectroscopy for colorectal cancer detection,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-79517-2,12 Jan 2021,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common type of cancer worldwide and the second most deadly. Recent research efforts have focused on developing non-invasive techniques for CRC detection. In this study, we evaluated the diagnostic capabilities of diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) for CRC detection by building 6 classification models based on support vector machines (SVMs). Our dataset consists of 2889 diffuse reflectance spectra collected from freshly excised ex vivo tissues of 47 patients over wavelengths ranging from 350 and 1919 nm with source-detector distances of 630-µm and 2500-µm to probe different depths. Quadratic SVMs were used and performance was evaluated using twofold cross-validation on 10 iterations of randomized training and test sets. We achieved (93.5 ± 2.4)% sensitivity, (94.0 ± 1.7)% specificity AUC by probing the superficial colorectal tissue and (96.1 ± 1.8)% sensitivity, (95.7 ± 0.6)% specificity AUC by sampling deeper tissue layers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first DRS study to investigate the potential of probing deeper tissue layers using larger SDD probes for CRC detection in the luminal wall. The data analysis showed that using a broader spectrum and longer near-infrared wavelengths can improve the diagnostic accuracy of CRC as well as probing deeper tissue layers.","In this study, we evaluated the usefulness of the extended wavelength range for improving CRC detection using DRS and compared results achieved in this study with previous research. By using probing the superficial tissue, we obtained (93.5 ± 2.4)% sensitivity, (94.0 ± 1.7)% specificity and 0.971 ± 0.014 AUROC, whereas (96.1 ± 1.8)% sensitivity, (95.7 ± 0.6)% specificity and 0.987 ± 0.005 AUROC was achieved by sampling deeper tissue layers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first DRS study to investigate the potential of probing deeper tissue layers using larger SDD probes for CRC detection in the luminal wall. Our study was conducted in ex vivo tissues, while it is straight forward to extend this methodology to an in vivo examination during endoscopy. Future studies employing diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, elastic scattering spectroscopy, near-infrared spectroscopy, hyperspectral imaging and spatial frequency domain imaging can exploit enhanced tumor detection due to the use of large SDD probes and the broadband wavelength range illustrated in this study. In a practical perspective, this study could potentially be used to develop a probe for CRC detection during colonoscopy. Real-time tissue classification is enabled by automated SVM model coupled with a DRS instrument capable of displaying the result of a single reading in about 2–3 s. By integrating this capability into a flexible fiberoptic probe which could be passed down a scope working channel, optical spectroscopy can obviate the need for multiple biopsies or polypectomies of normal mucosa as well as identify more subtle mucosal abnormalities such as sessile serrated polyps for example, which may be difficult to recognize during colonoscopy.","Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Anti-senescent drug screening by deep learning-based morphology senescence scoring,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-20213-0,11 Jan 2021,"Advances in deep learning technology have enabled complex task solutions. The accuracy of image classification tasks has improved owing to the establishment of convolutional neural networks (CNN). Cellular senescence is a hallmark of ageing and is important for the pathogenesis of ageing-related diseases. Furthermore, it is a potential therapeutic target. Specific molecular markers are used to identify senescent cells. Moreover senescent cells show unique morphology, which can be identified. We develop a successful morphology-based CNN system to identify senescent cells and a quantitative scoring system to evaluate the state of endothelial cells by senescence probability output from pre-trained CNN optimised for the classification of cellular senescence, Deep Learning-Based Senescence Scoring System by Morphology (Deep-SeSMo). Deep-SeSMo correctly evaluates the effects of well-known anti-senescent reagents. We screen for drugs that control cellular senescence using a kinase inhibitor library by Deep-SeSMo-based drug screening and identify four anti-senescent drugs. RNA sequence analysis reveals that these compounds commonly suppress senescent phenotypes through inhibition of the inflammatory response pathway. Thus, morphology-based CNN system can be a powerful tool for anti-senescent drug screening.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Realizing the full potential of iBCIs critically depends on continued progress in understanding how different cortical areas contribute to movement control. Here we present the first comparison between neuronal ensemble recordings from the left middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and precentral gyrus (PCG) of a person with tetraplegia using an iBCI. As expected, PCG was more engaged in selecting and generating intended movements than in earlier perceptual stages of action planning. By contrast, MFG displayed movement-related information during the sensorimotor processing steps preceding the appearance of the action plan in PCG, but only when the actions were instructed using auditory cues. These results describe a previously unreported function for neurons in the human left MFG in auditory processing contributing to motor control.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Sleep classification from wrist-worn accelerometer data using random forests,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-79217-x,08 Jan 2021,"Accurate and low-cost sleep measurement tools are needed in both clinical and epidemiological research. To this end, wearable accelerometers are widely used as they are both low in price and provide reasonably accurate estimates of movement. Techniques to classify sleep from the high-resolution accelerometer data primarily rely on heuristic algorithms. In this paper, we explore the potential of detecting sleep using Random forests. Models were trained using data from three different studies where 134 adult participants (70 with sleep disorder and 64 good healthy sleepers) wore an accelerometer on their wrist during a one-night polysomnography recording in the clinic. The Random forests were able to distinguish sleep-wake states with an F1 score of 73.93% on a previously unseen test set of 24 participants. Detecting when the accelerometer is not worn was also successful using machine learning (\(\hbox {F1-score} > 93.31\%\)), and when combined with our sleep detection models on day-time data provide a sleep estimate that is correlated with self-reported habitual nap behaviour (\(\hbox {r}=.60\)). These Random forest models have been made open-source to aid further research. In line with literature, sleep stage classification turned out to be difficult using only accelerometer data.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Development and validation of an interpretable neural network for prediction of postoperative in-hospital mortality,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-020-00377-1,08 Jan 2021,"While deep neural networks (DNNs) and other machine learning models often have higher accuracy than simpler models like logistic regression (LR), they are often considered to be “black box” models and this lack of interpretability and transparency is considered a challenge for clinical adoption. In healthcare, intelligible models not only help clinicians to understand the problem and create more targeted action plans, but also help to gain the clinicians’ trust. One method of overcoming the limited interpretability of more complex models is to use Generalized Additive Models (GAMs). Standard GAMs simply model the target response as a sum of univariate models. Inspired by GAMs, the same idea can be applied to neural networks through an architecture referred to as Generalized Additive Models with Neural Networks (GAM-NNs). In this manuscript, we present the development and validation of a model applying the concept of GAM-NNs to allow for interpretability by visualizing the learned feature patterns related to risk of in-hospital mortality for patients undergoing surgery under general anesthesia. The data consists of 59,985 patients with a feature set of 46 features extracted at the end of surgery to which we added previously not included features: total anesthesia case time (1 feature); the time in minutes spent with mean arterial pressure (MAP) below 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, and 65 mmHg during surgery (6 features); and Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) Code Descriptions of the Primary current procedure terminology (CPT) codes (33 features) for a total of 86 features. All data were randomly split into 80% for training (n = 47,988) and 20% for testing (n = 11,997) prior to model development. Model performance was compared to a standard LR model using the same features as the GAM-NN. The data consisted of 59,985 surgical records, and the occurrence of in-hospital mortality was 0.81% in the training set and 0.72% in the testing set. The GAM-NN model with HCUP features had the highest area under the curve (AUC) 0.921 (0.895–0.95). Overall, both GAM-NN models had higher AUCs than LR models, however, had lower average precisions. The LR model without HCUP features had the highest average precision 0.217 (0.136–0.31). To assess the interpretability of the GAM-NNs, we then visualized the learned contributions of the GAM-NNs and compared against the learned contributions of the LRs for the models with HCUP features. Overall, we were able to demonstrate that our proposed generalized additive neural network (GAM-NN) architecture is able to (1) leverage a neural network’s ability to learn nonlinear patterns in the data, which is more clinically intuitive, (2) be interpreted easily, making it more clinically useful, and (3) maintain model performance as compared to previously published DNNs.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

A novel simple risk model to predict the prognosis of patients with paraquat poisoning,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-80371-5,08 Jan 2021,"To identify risk factors and develop a simple model to predict early prognosis of acute paraquat (PQ) poisoning patients, we performed a retrospective cohort study of acute PQ poisoning patients (n = 1199). Patients (n = 913) with PQ poisoning from 2011 to 2018 were randomly divided into training (n = 609) and test (n = 304) samples. Another two independent cohorts were used as validation samples for a different time (n = 207) and site (n = 79). Risk factors were identified using a logistic model with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation and further evaluated using a latent class analysis. The prediction score was developed based on the training sample and was evaluated using the testing and validation samples. Eight factors, including age, ingestion volume, creatine kinase-MB [CK-MB], platelet [PLT], white blood cell [WBC], neutrophil counts [N], gamma-glutamyl transferase [GGT], and serum creatinine [Cr] were identified as independent risk indicators of in-hospital death events. The risk model had C statistics of 0.895 (95% CI 0.855–0.928), 0.891 (95% CI 0.848–0.932), and 0.829 (95% CI 0.455–1.000), and predictive ranges of 4.6–98.2%, 2.3–94.9%, and 0–12.5% for the test, validation_time, and validation_site samples, respectively. In the training sample, the risk model classified 18.4%, 59.9%, and 21.7% of patients into the high-, average-, and low-risk groups, with corresponding probabilities of 0.985, 0.365, and 0.03 for in-hospital death events. We developed and evaluated a simple risk model to predict the prognosis of patients with acute PQ poisoning.

Gene expression profiling-based risk prediction and profiles of immune infiltration in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41408-020-00404-0,07 Jan 2021,"The clinical risk stratification of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) relies on the International Prognostic Index (IPI) for the identification of high-risk disease. Recent studies suggest that the immune microenvironment plays a role in treatment response prediction and survival in DLBCL. This study developed a risk prediction model and evaluated the model’s biological implications in association with the estimated profiles of immune infiltration. Gene-expression profiling of 718 patients with DLBCL was done, for which RNA sequencing data and clinical covariates were obtained from Reddy et al. (2017). Using unsupervised and supervised machine learning methods to identify survival-associated gene signatures, a multivariable model of survival was constructed. Tumor-infiltrating immune cell compositions were enumerated using CIBERSORT deconvolution analysis. A four gene-signature-based score was developed that separated patients into high- and low-risk groups. The combination of the gene-expression-based score with the IPI improved the discrimination on the validation and complete sets. The gene signatures were successfully validated with the deconvolution output. Correlating the deconvolution findings with the gene signatures and risk score, CD8+ T-cells and naïve CD4+ T-cells were associated with favorable prognosis. By analyzing the gene-expression data with a systematic approach, a risk prediction model that outperforms the existing risk assessment methods was developed and validated.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: evasion; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Distinct trajectories of response to prefrontal tDCS in major depression: results from a 3-arm randomized controlled trial,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41386-020-00935-x,21 Dec 2020,"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a safe, effective treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). While antidepressant effects are heterogeneous, no studies have investigated trajectories of tDCS response. We characterized distinct improvement trajectories and associated baseline characteristics for patients treated with prefrontal tDCS, an active pharmacotherapy (escitalopram), and placebo. This is a secondary analysis of a randomized, non-inferiority, double-blinded trial (ELECT-TDCS, N = 245). Participants were diagnosed with an acute unipolar, nonpsychotic, depressive episode, and presented Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (17-items, HAM-D) scores ≥17. Latent trajectory modeling was used to identify HAM-D response trajectories over a 10-week treatment. Top-down (hypothesis-driven) and bottom-up (data-driven) methods were employed to explore potential predictive features using, respectively, conservatively corrected regression models and a cross-validated stability ranking procedure combined with elastic net regularization. Three trajectory classes that were distinct in response speed and intensity (rapid, slow, and no/minimal improvement) were identified for escitalopram, tDCS, and placebo. Differences in response and remission rates were significant early for all groups. Depression severity, use of benzodiazepines, and age were associated with no/minimal improvement. No significant differences in trajectory assignment were found in tDCS vs. placebo comparisons (38.3, 34, and 27.6%; vs. 23.3, 43.3, and 33.3% for rapid, slow, and no/minimal trajectories, respectively). Additional features are suggested in bottom-up analyses. Summarily, groups treated with tDCS, escitalopram, and placebo differed in trajectory class distributions and baseline predictors of response.

Dynamic survival prediction in intensive care units from heterogeneous time series without the need for variable selection or curation,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-79142-z,17 Dec 2020,"Extensive monitoring in intensive care units (ICUs) generates large quantities of data which contain numerous trends that are difficult for clinicians to systematically evaluate. Current approaches to such heterogeneity in electronic health records (EHRs) discard pertinent information. We present a deep learning pipeline that uses all uncurated chart, lab, and output events for prediction of in-hospital mortality without variable selection. Over 21,000 ICU patients and tens of thousands of variables derived from the MIMIC-III database were used to train and validate our model. Recordings in the first few hours of a patient’s stay were found to be strongly predictive of mortality, outperforming models using SAPS II and OASIS scores, AUROC 0.72 and 0.76 at 24 h respectively, within just 12 h of ICU admission. Our model achieves a very strong predictive performance of AUROC 0.85 (95% CI 0.83–0.86) after 48 h. Predictive performance increases over the first 48 h, but suffers from diminishing returns, providing rationale for time-limited trials of critical care and suggesting that the timing of decision making can be optimised and individualised.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Impact of data on generalization of AI for surgical intelligence applications,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-79173-6,17 Dec 2020,"AI is becoming ubiquitous, revolutionizing many aspects of our lives. In surgery, it is still a promise. AI has the potential to improve surgeon performance and impact patient care, from post-operative debrief to real-time decision support. But, how much data is needed by an AI-based system to learn surgical context with high fidelity? To answer this question, we leveraged a large-scale, diverse, cholecystectomy video dataset. We assessed surgical workflow recognition and report a deep learning system, that not only detects surgical phases, but does so with high accuracy and is able to generalize to new settings and unseen medical centers. Our findings provide a solid foundation for translating AI applications from research to practice, ushering in a new era of surgical intelligence.","In this work, we follow previously suggested guidelines for ML to overcome “barriers to deployment” and have an actual impact on healthcare34.

Challenges such as data quantity and quality and model generalizability are addressed in this study. Since our dataset is more than an order of magnitude larger than any previous study it provides in-depth knowledge of surgical workflow characteristics. In addition, as ML systems are often considered as a “black-box”, we train our approach based on predefined phase mapping, agreed to by a group of experts in the field. This ensures that healthcare professionals understand and can interpret the results.In summary, the contributions of this work are threefold. First, we leverage a large and diverse surgical video dataset and apply state-of-the-art methods for video analysis to introduce a deep learning system that achieves more than 90% accuracy in detecting the correct surgical phase. In order to support future research in this field, we report the set of hyperparameters learned and optimized with our dataset, allowing to train models on smaller but publicly available datasets. Second, we report a comprehensive analysis, assessing the likely asymptotic performance of our phase detection system and evaluating the generalization of our approach to different medical centers and a diverse surgeon population. Third, given a set of unseen videos from a new medical center, we demonstrate that by fine-tuning on a relatively small number of new samples, our model can converge to a similar high performance.Examining the number of videos needed in order to learn the surgical workflow shows high return in performance when going from tens to hundreds of training videos, where a diminishing effect in accuracy is starting to appear. We do note that our performance assessment was done using a fixed model capacity. Increasing the available data to thousands or even tens of thousands of videos may offer additional improvements by also increasing the model capacity.As opposed to elite athletes who can review performance and analyze every roll, pitch and yaw post-competition, surgeons lack objective tools to routinely debrief and analyze performance. The current level of accuracy allows for the creation of surgical highlight reels that can be returned to a surgeon quickly after exiting the operating room. Higher levels of accuracy will be required in order to leverage such capabilities for real-time decision support.The results in this report are limited to one specific surgical procedure, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, which has a relatively linear phase progression. Further analysis is needed in order to ensure the transferability of the ideas presented here to less structured or lengthy procedures. In addition, both modules do not assume any causality constraints and design to operate offline on the entire surgical video. However, enforcing such constraints can easily be done by adjusting the models to “look” at past inputs only. The evaluation of such models is not within the scope of this work. Although procedures from MC1 were curated over decades and capture high surgical variability, the dataset is still skewed towards this single center. Our generalization exploration focuses on high-level biases, which might occur due to different medical centers, surgeons and techniques. Once sufficiently labeled, future exploration should be done to assess both patient-level bias factors such as age, BMI, ethnicity, sex, anatomy variance, etc. and medical-center-level bias, e.g. by grouping procedures based on visualization hardware, instruments, or on the period or date of performing the surgery. Our models are also limited in handling outliers, such as very low video quality or in case a new surgical tool, never seen before, is used.The hyperparameters described for the short- and long-term approach enable training robust models on relatively small, but publicly available, datasets such as Cholec8011 and EndoTube36. The ability to detect surgical phases with high accuracy can promote the development of other surgical applications and support continuous research in this field. In addition, robust phase detection models can be the catalyst for studies of intraoperative event detection or applying transfer learning on other types of laparoscopic procedures.There are many opportunities for ML-based AI in the operating room10. Regardless of the use case, a foundational step in integrating AI systems into routine surgeon workflow is the ability to analyze and successfully discern between different surgical phases. Thus, surgical phase detection is a key benchmark problem to assess the ability of AI to successfully learn surgical context.We believe our analysis can further accelerate computer vision-based research and applications for laparoscopic surgery to the point of integrating AI systems in the surgical workflow routine, assisting in the decision-making processes and ultimately improving surgeon experience and patient care.","DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Differential diagnosis of vergence and saccade disorders in dyslexia,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-79089-1,17 Dec 2020,"Previous studies suggest vergence and saccade abnormalities in dyslexic adolescents. However, these studies are mainly clinically based and do not provide objective measurements of eye movements, but rather subjectively evaluate vergence using haplosopic conditions in which the two eyes are dissociated (via polarizers, prisms, or intermittent spectacles). Other studies have identified deficits with binocular coordination during reading in dyslexics. Yet, there are few studies that provide objective measurements of eye movements in the dyslexic population to help provide more information regarding if these deficits could be due to an intrinsic motor problem or if they are the consequence of poor reading. 47 dyslexic adolescents (18 female, 29 male; mean age 15.5) and 44 non-dyslexic adolescents (22 female, 22 male; mean age 14.8) wore a head-based eye tracker (PupilCore, Pupil Labs, Berlin) which recorded wide angle saccade and vergence eye movements at 200 Hz. Tests were run using the REMOBI device, which produced a saccade or vergence audiovisual target. Analysis of eye movements was performed with lab-developed software, AIDEAL. The results showed statistically significant abnormalities in vergence and saccades. In vergence, dyslexics displayed a reduced amplitude of the visually driven portion of convergence and a longer duration in the initial phase of divergence. In saccades, dyslexic adolescents demonstrated slower saccades in both directions. They also had an increased disconjugate drift in the first 80 or 160 ms following saccades to the right, suggesting poor binocular coordination. For both vergence and saccades, the peak velocity and time to peak velocity was higher and earlier, respectively, in non-dyslexics compared to dyslexics; yet the average velocity of both movements was lower in dyslexics. Thus, these results indicate peculiar velocity profiles in dyslexics, particularly a slow deceleration phase in both vergence and saccades. The study provides an objective method to diagnose vergence and saccade abnormalities while viewing targets in the real three-dimensional space in a dyslexic population. Vergence abnormalities are demonstrated to be a problem in dyslexics, occurring independently from reading. We hypothesize these disconjugate drifts following saccades are the result of slow vergence capacity. Rehabilitation programs, such as those using REMOBI, should aim to target these deficits in vergence velocity, as this has been shown to improve binocular control.",Conclusions not available,,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
A flexible computational pipeline for research analyses of unsolved clinical exome cases,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41525-020-00161-w,10 Dec 2020,"Exome sequencing has enabled molecular diagnoses for rare disease patients but often with initial diagnostic rates of ~25−30%. Here we develop a robust computational pipeline to rank variants for reassessment of unsolved rare disease patients. A comprehensive web-based patient report is generated in which all deleterious variants can be filtered by gene, variant characteristics, OMIM disease and Phenolyzer scores, and all are annotated with an ACMG classification and links to ClinVar. The pipeline ranked 21/34 previously diagnosed variants as top, with 26 in total ranked ≤7th, 3 ranked ≥13th; 5 failed the pipeline filters. Pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants by ACMG criteria were identified for 22/145 unsolved cases, and a previously undefined candidate disease variant for 27/145. This open access pipeline supports the partnership between clinical and research laboratories to improve the diagnosis of unsolved exomes. It provides a flexible framework for iterative developments to further improve diagnosis.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Dysgraphia detection through machine learning,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-78611-9,09 Dec 2020,"Dysgraphia, a disorder affecting the written expression of symbols and words, negatively impacts the academic results of pupils as well as their overall well-being. The use of automated procedures can make dysgraphia testing available to larger populations, thereby facilitating early intervention for those who need it. In this paper, we employed a machine learning approach to identify handwriting deteriorated by dysgraphia. To achieve this goal, we collected a new handwriting dataset consisting of several handwriting tasks and extracted a broad range of features to capture different aspects of handwriting. These were fed to a machine learning algorithm to predict whether handwriting is affected by dysgraphia. We compared several machine learning algorithms and discovered that the best results were achieved by the adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) algorithm. The results show that machine learning can be used to detect dysgraphia with almost 80% accuracy, even when dealing with a heterogeneous set of subjects differing in age, sex and handedness.","Our study provides new data, a new orthography and an algorithm not previously used for dysgraphia recognition. We introduced several new features that have not previously been used to evaluate handwriting and dysgraphia. These features proved relevant for diagnosis and, moreover, offer a high level of interpretability. Features such as maximum segment vertical length, minimum segment height, and difference between maximum y-positions of the second and penultimate segments can be directly related to changes in handwriting due to dysgraphia. In conclusion, the proposed approach was able to recognize dysgraphic handwriting with almost 80% accuracy; however, the dataset includes subjects aged 8–15 years. This is a relatively wide age range, especially for handwriting, since handwriting is still developing and changing during these years. This makes classification tasks more challenging than in more focused datasets.The proposed model can be employed as part of a decision support system to assist professionals in occupational therapy to provide more objective diagnosis. Some commercially available conventional tablets now offer the possibility of capturing handwriting, which would allow a whole decision support system to be implemented on a tablet device at relatively low cost, thus opening possibilities for extensive screening of children for dysgraphia in schools.The limitations of our study lie in the fact that we used only Slovak orthography and tested children in a relatively broad age range with fewer cases in separate age groups, so we could not pinpoint differences between children of different ages. Additional studies are necessary to identify whether the features proposed by us and others9,18 are valid for other orthographies and other age cohorts.","Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Vital signs assessed in initial clinical encounters predict COVID-19 mortality in an NYC hospital system,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-78392-1,09 Dec 2020,"Timely and effective clinical decision-making for COVID-19 requires rapid identification of risk factors for disease outcomes. Our objective was to identify characteristics available immediately upon first clinical evaluation related COVID-19 mortality. We conducted a retrospective study of 8770 laboratory-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 from a network of 53 facilities in New-York City. We analysed 3 classes of variables; demographic, clinical, and comorbid factors, in a two-tiered analysis that included traditional regression strategies and machine learning. COVID-19 mortality was 12.7%. Logistic regression identified older age (OR, 1.69 [95% CI 1.66–1.92]), male sex (OR, 1.57 [95% CI 1.30–1.90]), higher BMI (OR, 1.03 [95% CI 1.102–1.05]), higher heart rate (OR, 1.01 [95% CI 1.00–1.01]), higher respiratory rate (OR, 1.05 [95% CI 1.03–1.07]), lower oxygen saturation (OR, 0.94 [95% CI 0.93–0.96]), and chronic kidney disease (OR, 1.53 [95% CI 1.20–1.95]) were associated with COVID-19 mortality. Using gradient-boosting machine learning, these factors predicted COVID-19 related mortality (AUC = 0.86) following cross-validation in a training set. Immediate, objective and culturally generalizable measures accessible upon clinical presentation are effective predictors of COVID-19 outcome. These findings may inform rapid response strategies to optimize health care delivery in parts of the world who have not yet confronted this epidemic, as well as in those forecasting a possible second outbreak.","In this retrospective observational study focusing on demographic and clinical characteristics of confirmed COVID-19 patients in a large NYC hospital system, older age, being a male, higher BMI, presenting vitals of higher heart rate, higher respiratory rate and lower O2 saturation as well as having CKD, were identified as risk factors for COVID-19 mortality. We found that these factors could be combined in a gradient-boosting machine learning model to create an effective predictor of mortality with an AUC of 0.86. Notably, our results show that immediate, objective measures collected at the time of clinical presentation, independently of patient level of consciousness, can be effective predictors of mortality. Reliance on results from hematologic and biochemical laboratory tests or extensive medical history review may create a critical lag in response time. These findings may inform rapid response strategies to optimize health care delivery in parts of the world who have yet confronted this epidemic, as well as in those forecasting a possible second outbreak.","Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Personalized quantification of facial normality: a machine learning approach,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-78180-x,07 Dec 2020,"What is a normal face? A fundamental task for the facial reconstructive surgeon is to answer that question as it pertains to any given individual. Accordingly, it would be important to be able to place the facial appearance of a patient with congenital or acquired deformity numerically along their own continuum of normality, and to measure any surgical changes against such a personalized benchmark. This has not previously been possible. We have solved this problem by designing a computerized model that produces realistic, normalized versions of any given facial image, and objectively measures the perceptual distance between the raw and normalized facial image pair. The model is able to faithfully predict human scoring of facial normality. We believe this work represents a paradigm shift in the assessment of the human face, holding great promise for development as an objective tool for surgical planning, patient education, and as a means for clinical outcome measurement.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
nnU-Net: a self-configuring method for deep learning-based biomedical image segmentation,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-020-01008-z,07 Dec 2020,"Biomedical imaging is a driver of scientific discovery and a core component of medical care and is being stimulated by the field of deep learning. While semantic segmentation algorithms enable image analysis and quantification in many applications, the design of respective specialized solutions is non-trivial and highly dependent on dataset properties and hardware conditions. We developed nnU-Net, a deep learning-based segmentation method that automatically configures itself, including preprocessing, network architecture, training and post-processing for any new task. The key design choices in this process are modeled as a set of fixed parameters, interdependent rules and empirical decisions. Without manual intervention, nnU-Net surpasses most existing approaches, including highly specialized solutions on 23 public datasets used in international biomedical segmentation competitions. We make nnU-Net publicly available as an out-of-the-box tool, rendering state-of-the-art segmentation accessible to a broad audience by requiring neither expert knowledge nor computing resources beyond standard network training.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Feature replacement methods enable reliable home video analysis for machine learning detection of autism,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-76874-w,04 Dec 2020,"Autism Spectrum Disorder is a neuropsychiatric condition affecting 53 million children worldwide and for which early diagnosis is critical to the outcome of behavior therapies. Machine learning applied to features manually extracted from readily accessible videos (e.g., from smartphones) has the potential to scale this diagnostic process. However, nearly unavoidable variability in video quality can lead to missing features that degrade algorithm performance. To manage this uncertainty, we evaluated the impact of missing values and feature imputation methods on two previously published autism detection classifiers, trained on standard-of-care instrument scoresheets and tested on ratings of 140 children videos from YouTube. We compare the baseline method of listwise deletion to classic univariate and multivariate techniques. We also introduce a feature replacement method that, based on a score, selects a feature from an expanded dataset to fill-in the missing value. The replacement feature selected can be identical for all records (general) or automatically adjusted to the record considered (dynamic). Our results show that general and dynamic feature replacement methods achieve a higher performance than classic univariate and multivariate methods, supporting the hypothesis that algorithmic management can maintain the fidelity of video-based diagnostics in the face of missing values and variable video quality.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Saturation transfer properties of tumour xenografts derived from prostate cancer cell lines 22Rv1 and DU145,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-78353-8,04 Dec 2020,"Histopathology is currently the most reliable tool in assessing the aggressiveness and prognosis of solid tumours. However, developing non-invasive modalities for tumour evaluation remains crucial due to the side effects and complications caused by biopsy procedures. In this study, saturation transfer MRI was used to investigate the microstructural and metabolic properties of tumour xenografts in mice derived from the prostate cancer cell lines 22Rv1 and DU145, which express different aggressiveness. The magnetization transfer (MT) and chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) effects, which are associated with the microstructural and metabolic properties in biological tissue, respectively, were analyzed quantitatively and compared amongst different tumour types and regions. Histopathological staining was performed as a reference. Higher cellular density and metabolism expressed in more aggressive tumours (22Rv1) were associated with larger MT and CEST effects. High collagen content in the necrotic regions might explain their higher MT effects compared to tumour regions.",Conclusions not available,Gen AI,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Forecasting the long-term trend of COVID-19 epidemic using a dynamic model,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-78084-w,03 Dec 2020,"The current outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has recently been declared as a pandemic and spread over 200 countries and territories. Forecasting the long-term trend of the COVID-19 epidemic can help health authorities determine the transmission characteristics of the virus and take appropriate prevention and control strategies beforehand. Previous studies that solely applied traditional epidemic models or machine learning models were subject to underfitting or overfitting problems. We propose a new model named Dynamic-Susceptible-Exposed-Infective-Quarantined (D-SEIQ), by making appropriate modifications of the Susceptible-Exposed-Infective-Recovered (SEIR) model and integrating machine learning based parameter optimization under epidemiological rational constraints. We used the model to predict the long-term reported cumulative numbers of COVID-19 cases in China from January 27, 2020. We evaluated our model on officially reported confirmed cases from three different regions in China, and the results proved the effectiveness of our model in terms of simulating and predicting the trend of the COVID-19 outbreak. In China-Excluding-Hubei area within 7 days after the first public report, our model successfully and accurately predicted the long trend up to 40 days and the exact date of the outbreak peak. The predicted cumulative number (12,506) by March 10, 2020, was only 3·8% different from the actual number (13,005). The parameters obtained by our model proved the effectiveness of prevention and intervention strategies on epidemic control in China. The prediction results for five other countries suggested the external validity of our model. The integrated approach of epidemic and machine learning models could accurately forecast the long-term trend of the COVID-19 outbreak. The model parameters also provided insights into the analysis of COVID-19 transmission and the effectiveness of interventions in China.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Early prediction of neoadjuvant chemotherapy response for advanced breast cancer using PET/MRI image deep learning,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-77875-5,03 Dec 2020,"This study aimed to investigate the predictive efficacy of positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the pathological response of advanced breast cancer to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). The breast PET/MRI image deep learning model was introduced and compared with the conventional methods. PET/CT and MRI parameters were evaluated before and after the first NAC cycle in patients with advanced breast cancer [n = 56; all women; median age, 49 (range 26–66) years]. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) were obtained with the corresponding baseline values (SUV0, MTV0, and TLG0, respectively) and interim PET images (SUV1, MTV1, and TLG1, respectively). Mean apparent diffusion coefficients were obtained from baseline and interim diffusion MR images (ADC0 and ADC1, respectively). The differences between the baseline and interim parameters were measured (ΔSUV, ΔMTV, ΔTLG, and ΔADC). Subgroup analysis was performed for the HER2-negative and triple-negative groups. Datasets for convolutional neural network (CNN), assigned as training (80%) and test datasets (20%), were cropped from the baseline (PET0, MRI0) and interim (PET1, MRI1) images. Histopathologic responses were assessed using the Miller and Payne system, after three cycles of chemotherapy. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to assess the performance of the differentiating responders and non-responders. There were six responders (11%) and 50 non-responders (89%). The area under the curve (AUC) was the highest for ΔSUV at 0.805 (95% CI 0.677–0.899). The AUC was the highest for ΔSUV at 0.879 (95% CI 0.722–0.965) for the HER2-negative subtype. AUC improved following CNN application (SUV0:PET0 = 0.652:0.886, SUV1:PET1 = 0.687:0.980, and ADC1:MRI1 = 0.537:0.701), except for ADC0 (ADC0:MRI0 = 0.703:0.602).

Sparse-view (100 views, full-scan) projection data were reconstructed using the FDK algorithm. The proposed MS-RDN uses the sparse-view and reference FDK reconstructions as input and label, respectively. Our MS-RDN evaluated with respect to fully sampled FDK reference yields superior performance, quantitatively and visually, compared to conventional compressed sensing methods and state-of-the-art deep learning based methods.

Using machine learning tools to predict outcomes for emergency department intensive care unit patients,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-77548-3,01 Dec 2020,"The number of critically ill patients has increased globally along with the rise in emergency visits. Mortality prediction for critical patients is vital for emergency care, which affects the distribution of emergency resources. Traditional scoring systems are designed for all emergency patients using a classic mathematical method, but risk factors in critically ill patients have complex interactions, so traditional scoring cannot as readily apply to them. As an accurate model for predicting the mortality of emergency department critically ill patients is lacking, this study’s objective was to develop a scoring system using machine learning optimized for the unique case of critical patients in emergency departments. We conducted a retrospective cohort study in a tertiary medical center in Beijing, China. Patients over 16 years old were included if they were alive when they entered the emergency department intensive care unit system from February 2015 and December 2015. Mortality up to 7 days after admission into the emergency department was considered as the primary outcome, and 1624 cases were included to derive the models. Prospective factors included previous diseases, physiologic parameters, and laboratory results. Several machine learning tools were built for 7-day mortality using these factors, for which their predictive accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) was evaluated by area under the curve (AUC). The AUCs were 0.794, 0.840, 0.849 and 0.822 respectively, for the SVM, GBDT, XGBoost and logistic regression model. In comparison with the SAPS 3 model (AUC = 0.826), the discriminatory capability of the newer machine learning methods, XGBoost in particular, is demonstrated to be more reliable for predicting outcomes for emergency department intensive care unit patients.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Predicting the need for intubation in the first 24 h after critical care admission using machine learning approaches,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-77893-3,01 Dec 2020,"Early and accurate prediction of the need for intubation may provide more time for preparation and increase safety margins by avoiding high risk late intubation. This study evaluates whether machine learning can predict the need for intubation within 24 h using commonly available bedside and laboratory parameters taken at critical care admission. We extracted data from 2 large critical care databases (MIMIC-III and eICU-CRD). Missing variables were imputed using autoencoder. Machine learning classifiers using logistic regression and random forest were trained using 60% of the data and tested using the remaining 40% of the data. We compared the performance of logistic regression and random forest models to predict intubation in critically ill patients. After excluding patients with limitations of therapy and missing data, we included 17,616 critically ill patients in this retrospective cohort. Within 24 h of admission, 2,292 patients required intubation, whilst 15,324 patients were not intubated. Blood gas parameters (PaO2, PaCO2, HCO3−), Glasgow Coma Score, respiratory variables (respiratory rate, SpO2), temperature, age, and oxygen therapy were used to predict intubation. Random forest had AUC 0.86 (95% CI 0.85–0.87) and logistic regression had AUC 0.77 (95% CI 0.76–0.78) for intubation prediction performance. Random forest model had sensitivity of 0.88 (95% CI 0.86–0.90) and specificity of 0.66 (95% CI 0.63–0.69), with good calibration throughout the range of intubation risks. The results showed that machine learning could predict the need for intubation in critically ill patients using commonly collected bedside clinical parameters and laboratory results. It may be used in real-time to help clinicians predict the need for intubation within 24 h of intensive care unit admission.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: poisoning; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Network and pathway expansion of genetic disease associations identifies successful drug targets,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-77847-9,01 Dec 2020,"Genetic evidence of disease association has often been used as a basis for selecting of drug targets for complex common diseases. Likewise, the propagation of genetic evidence through gene or protein interaction networks has been shown to accurately infer novel disease associations at genes for which no direct genetic evidence can be observed. However, an empirical test of the utility of combining these approaches for drug discovery has been lacking. In this study, we examine genetic associations arising from an analysis of 648 UK Biobank GWAS and evaluate whether targets identified as proxies of direct genetic hits are enriched for successful drug targets, as measured by historical clinical trial data. We find that protein networks formed from specific functional linkages such as protein complexes and ligand–receptor pairs are suitable for even naïve guilt-by-association network propagation approaches. In addition, more sophisticated approaches applied to global protein–protein interaction networks and pathway databases, also successfully retrieve targets enriched for clinically successful drug targets. We conclude that network propagation of genetic evidence can be used for drug target identification.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: ; Attacker Capability:

Assessment of metastatic lymph nodes in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas using simultaneous 18F-FDG-PET and MRI,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-77740-5,27 Nov 2020,"In this study, we investigate the feasibility of using dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI), diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), and dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) for detection of metastatic lymph nodes in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cases. Twenty HNSCC patients scheduled for lymph node dissection underwent DCE-MRI, dynamic PET, and DWI using a PET-MR scanner within one week prior to their planned surgery. During surgery, resected nodes were labeled to identify their nodal levels and sent for routine clinical pathology evaluation. Quantitative parameters of metastatic and normal nodes were calculated from DCE-MRI (ve, vp, PS, Fp, Ktrans), DWI (ADC) and PET (Ki, K1, k2, k3) to assess if an individual or a combination of parameters can classify normal and metastatic lymph nodes accurately. There were 38 normal and 11 metastatic nodes covered by all three imaging methods and confirmed by pathology. 34% of all normal nodes had volumes greater than or equal to the smallest metastatic node while 4 normal nodes had SUV > 4.5. Among the MRI parameters, the median vp, Fp, PS, and Ktrans values of the metastatic lymph nodes were significantly lower (p = <0.05) than those of normal nodes. ve and ADC did not show any statistical significance. For the dynamic PET parameters, the metastatic nodes had significantly higher k3 (p value = 8.8 × 10−8) and Ki (p value = 5.3 × 10−8) than normal nodes. K1 and k2 did not show any statistically significant difference. Ki had the best separation with accuracy = 0.96 (sensitivity = 1, specificity = 0.95) using a cutoff of Ki = 5.3 × 10−3 mL/cm3/min, while k3 and volume had accuracy of 0.94 (sensitivity = 0.82, specificity = 0.97) and 0.90 (sensitivity = 0.64, specificity = 0.97) respectively. 100% accuracy can be achieved using a multivariate logistic regression model of MRI parameters after thresholding the data with Ki < 5.3 × 10−3 mL/cm3/min. The results of this preliminary study suggest that quantitative MRI may provide additional value in distinguishing metastatic nodes, particularly among small nodes, when used together with FDG-PET.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Prognostic value of texture analysis from cardiac magnetic resonance imaging in patients with Takotsubo syndrome: a machine learning based proof-of-principle approach,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-76432-4,25 Nov 2020,"Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging has become an important technique for non-invasive diagnosis of takotsubo syndrome (TTS). The long-term prognostic value of CMR imaging in TTS has not been fully elucidated yet. This study sought to evaluate the prognostic value of texture analysis (TA) based on CMR images in patients with TTS using machine learning. In this multicenter study (InterTAK Registry), we investigated CMR imaging data of 58 patients (56 women, mean age 68 ± 12 years) with TTS. CMR imaging was performed in the acute to subacute phase (median time after symptom onset 4 days) of TTS. TA of the left ventricle was performed using free-hand regions-of-interest in short axis late gadolinium-enhanced and on T2-weighted (T2w) images. A total of 608 TA features adding the parameters age, gender, and body mass index were included. Dimension reduction was performed removing TA features with poor intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC ≤ 0.6) and those being redundant (correlation matrix with Pearson correlation coefficient r > 0.8). Five common machine-learning classifiers (artificial neural network Multilayer Perceptron, decision tree J48, NaïveBayes, RandomForest, and Sequential Minimal Optimization) with tenfold cross-validation were applied to assess 5-year outcome including major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE). Dimension reduction yielded 10 TA features carrying prognostic information, which were all based on T2w images. The NaïveBayes machine learning classifier showed overall best performance with a sensitivity of 82.9% (confidence interval (CI) 80–86.2), specificity of 83.7% (CI 75.7–92), and an area-under-the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.88 (CI 0.83–0.92). This proof-of-principle study is the first to identify unique T2w-derived TA features that predict long-term outcome in patients with TTS. These features might serve as imaging prognostic biomarkers in TTS patients.","In the present proof-of-principle study, we demonstrated that selected TA features, exclusively derived from T2w CMR images and identified through machine learning, have potential prognostic long-term value in patients with TTS. Thus, they may serve as novel imaging biomarkers for risk stratification in patients with TTS (Fig. 4).Figure 4Improving risk stratification in patients with takotsubo syndrome. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging-derived texture analysis features, identified through machine learning algorithms, have a prognostic value in patients with takotsubo syndrome.

Detection and classification of intracranial haemorrhage on CT images using a novel deep-learning algorithm,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-77441-z,25 Nov 2020,"A novel deep-learning algorithm for artificial neural networks (ANNs), completely different from the back-propagation method, was developed in a previous study. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of using the algorithm for the detection of intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) and the classification of its subtypes, without employing the convolutional neural network (CNN). For the detection of ICH with the summation of all the computed tomography (CT) images for each case, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.859, and the sensitivity and the specificity were 78.0% and 80.0%, respectively. Regarding ICH localisation, CT images were divided into 10 subdivisions based on the intracranial height. With the subdivision of 41–50%, the best diagnostic performance for detecting ICH was obtained with AUC of 0.903, the sensitivity of 82.5%, and the specificity of 84.1%. For the classification of the ICH to subtypes, the accuracy rate for subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) was considerably excellent at 91.7%. This study revealed that our approach can greatly reduce the ICH diagnosis time in an actual emergency situation with a fairly good diagnostic performance.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Successful application requires a highly detailed model of research options. We have constructed a model, the first of its kind, that accurately characterizes these options for the biomedical literature. The model comprises over 18 million PubMed documents from 1996–2019. Document relatedness was measured using a hybrid citation analysis + text similarity approach. The resulting 606.6 million document-to-document links were used to create 28,743 document clusters and an associated visual map. Clusters are characterized using metadata (e.g., phrases, MeSH) and over 20 indicators (e.g., funding, patent activity). The map and cluster-level data are embedded in Tableau to provide an interactive model enabling in-depth exploration of a research portfolio.

Full wave 3D inverse scattering transmission ultrasound tomography in the presence of high contrast,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-76754-3,19 Nov 2020,"We present here a quantitative ultrasound tomographic method yielding a sub-mm resolution, quantitative 3D representation of tissue characteristics in the presence of high contrast media. This result is a generalization of previous work where high impedance contrast was not present and may provide a clinically and laboratory relevant, relatively inexpensive, high resolution imaging method for imaging in the presence of bone. This allows tumor, muscle, tendon, ligament or cartilage disease monitoring for therapy and general laboratory or clinical settings. The method has proven useful in breast imaging and is generalized here to high-resolution quantitative imaging in the presence of bone. The laboratory data are acquired in ~ 12 min and the reconstruction in ~ 24 min—approximately 200 times faster than previously reported simulations in the literature. Such fast reconstructions with real data require careful calibration, adequate data redundancy from a 2D array of 2048 elements and a paraxial approximation. The imaging results show that tissue surrounding the high impedance region is artifact free and has correct speed of sound at sub-mm resolution.",Conclusions not available,Gen AI,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Convolutional neuronal networks combined with X-ray phase-contrast imaging for a fast and observer-independent discrimination of cartilage and liver diseases stages,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-76937-y,17 Nov 2020,"We applied transfer learning using Convolutional Neuronal Networks to high resolution X-ray phase contrast computed tomography datasets and tested the potential of the systems to accurately classify Computed Tomography images of different stages of two diseases, i.e. osteoarthritis and liver fibrosis. The purpose is to identify a time-effective and observer-independent methodology to identify pathological conditions. Propagation-based X-ray phase contrast imaging WAS used with polychromatic X-rays to obtain a 3D visualization of 4 human cartilage plugs and 6 rat liver samples with a voxel size of 0.7 × 0.7 × 0.7 µm3 and 2.2 × 2.2 × 2.2 µm3, respectively. Images with a size of 224 × 224 pixels are used to train three pre-trained convolutional neuronal networks for data classification, which are the VGG16, the Inception V3, and the Xception networks. We evaluated the performance of the three systems in terms of classification accuracy and studied the effect of the variation of the number of inputs, training images and of iterations. The VGG16 network provides the highest classification accuracy when the training and the validation-test of the network are performed using data from the same samples for both the cartilage (99.8%) and the liver (95.5%) datasets. The Inception V3 and Xception networks achieve an accuracy of 84.7% (43.1%) and of 72.6% (53.7%), respectively, for the cartilage (liver) images. By using data from different samples for the training and validation-test processes, the Xception network provided the highest test accuracy for the cartilage dataset (75.7%), while for the liver dataset the VGG16 network gave the best results (75.4%). By using convolutional neuronal networks we show that it is possible to classify large datasets of biomedical images in less than 25 min on a 8 CPU processor machine providing a precise, robust, fast and observer-independent method for the discrimination/classification of different stages of osteoarthritis and liver diseases.","In this work, we have investigated the possibility of using convolutional neuronal networks for the classification of healthy and pathological biological tissues considering two different biomedical cases: osteoarthritic cartilage and liver fibrosis. The evaluation of the samples was carried out by two experienced pathologists on the basis of the histological results, which served as golden standard.We have applied three CNNs (VGG16, Inception V3, and Xception networks) and compared their performances in terms of accuracy in the classification and the time needed for this calculation. The VGG16 network provided the highest accuracy, compared to the Inception V3 and Xception network in the analyzed cases. In the VGG16, the entire image is convoluted, whereas in the Inception V3 and the Xception networks, the image to be analyzed is split into different regions. This process of subdividing the images can lead to overfitting that causes poor performances of the networks when applied to data in the validation and testing phase. This fact determines the discrepancy between the training and the validation/testing accuracy curves for the Inception V3 and Xception networks. Additionally, this explains the discrepancy of our results with respect to the LSVRC competition.We also tested the effect of training the network with images of two cartilage samples (one healthy and one degenerated) and validated and tested with images of another cartilage sample: the testing accuracy decreased in all of the three networks. However, the Xception network was the one with the highest testing accuracy. This last fact shows that the Xception network model is the best generalized model, when splitting the dataset by sample type.Many different ways, such as additional fully connected layers and drop out layers, changing the optimizer algorithm or adjusting the learning rate, were used to reduce overfitting in the Xception and Inception V3 networks. The results we presented here were obtained after this optimization procedure (best accuracy and lowest overfitting); instead, the results of these intermediate optimization procedures were not reported.In the case of the cartilage, other computer-aided diagnosis tools are available, like texture analysis. This kind of analysis on cartilage PCI images for characterizing osteoarthritis, gives good results for both 2D images49 and 3D volumes50.The Inception V3 network with its inception modules is much faster for training, validation and testing than the other two networks. For the cartilage dataset, the Inception was 56.7% faster than the VGG16 network and 47.4% than the Xception. For the liver dataset, the Inception was 26.6% and 29.5% faster than the VGG16 and Xception networks, respectively. The reason of its higher performances lies in its unique inception module structure, which reduces the number of trainable weights and therefore speeds up the computation.With the data augmentation of the liver dataset, we could show that the networks converged faster when the number of input images was increased and therefore we needed fewer epochs. For the VGG16 network, the testing accuracy stayed approximately the same 95.5% and but the computational time increased by 23.5% from 34 min and 21 s to 42 min and 11 s because of increasing the number of input images by a factor of 4. We can conclude that more input data leads to a better accuracy and a faster convergence of the VGG network, but this does not come with shorter computational times.When we used data from different liver samples for the training and the testing of the networks, we achieved a decreased testing accuracy of all the networks, whereas the training accuracy increased. This result shows that an overfitting occurs and the networks do not generalize enough; to overcome this limitation, a larger number of samples should be used. The network presenting the best testing accuracy is the VGG16 with 75.38%, as in the calculation without the split based on samples. Both the Inception V3 and Xception networks testing accuracies were for this test below 50%; for this test and both networks did not perform well on liver data, in contrast to the cartilage data, were both networks had a testing accuracy above 68%.The testing accuracy strongly depends on the data splitting method that is used. If the slices for training and testing the CNN are extracted from the same sample, the data used in the two processes may look very similar and an overfitting of the networks during training may occur. In this case, the generalization of the CNN on new samples is unsettled and may be severely hindered.This study shows that the combination of advanced high sensitive X-ray imaging techniques (PCI) with newly available algorithms for data classification based on the neuronal network concept, could significantly support the discrimination between healthy-normal and pathological-abnormal conditions of biological tissues. The proof of concept of this methodology was here performed on small tissue samples (cylindrical bone/cartilage plugs of 7 mm in diameter). This method could be an important asset in the direction of the automation of diagnostic procedures. The application of CNNs to our datasets showed that these tools (in the specific case we identified the VGG16 network as the most accurate one) make it possible to analyze and classify sets of 9616 images of 224 × 224 pixels in less than 25 min providing a robust, fast and observer-independent method of diagnosis.","DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Comparing distress of mouse models for liver damage,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-76391-w,13 Nov 2020,"In order to foster animal welfare as well as high quality of research, many countries regulate by law that the severity of animal experiments must be evaluated and considered when performing biomedical research. It is well accepted that multiple parameters rather than a single readout parameter should be applied to describe animal distress or suffering. However, since the performance of readout parameters for animal distress is rarely defined and methods for multivariate analysis have only in rare cases been used, it is not known which methodology is most appropriate to define animal distress. This study used receiver operating characteristic curve analysis to quantify the performance of burrowing activity, body weight change and a distress score of mice after induction of liver damage by bile duct ligation or carbon tetrachloride. In addition, Support Vector Machine classification was used to compare the distress of these mouse models. This approach demonstrated that bile duct ligation causes much more distress than carbon tetrachloride-induced liver damage. This study, therefore, provides a prototype how to compare two animal models by considering several readout parameters. In the future these or similar methods for multivariate analysis will be necessary, when assessing and comparing the severity of animal models.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
"Context aware deep learning for brain tumor segmentation, subtype classification, and survival prediction using radiology images",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-74419-9,12 Nov 2020,"A brain tumor is an uncontrolled growth of cancerous cells in the brain. Accurate segmentation and classification of tumors are critical for subsequent prognosis and treatment planning. This work proposes context aware deep learning for brain tumor segmentation, subtype classification, and overall survival prediction using structural multimodal magnetic resonance images (mMRI). We first propose a 3D context aware deep learning, that considers uncertainty of tumor location in the radiology mMRI image sub-regions, to obtain tumor segmentation. We then apply a regular 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) on the tumor segments to achieve tumor subtype classification. Finally, we perform survival prediction using a hybrid method of deep learning and machine learning. To evaluate the performance, we apply the proposed methods to the Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge 2019 (BraTS 2019) dataset for tumor segmentation and overall survival prediction, and to the dataset of the Computational Precision Medicine Radiology-Pathology (CPM-RadPath) Challenge on Brain Tumor Classification 2019 for tumor classification. We also perform an extensive performance evaluation based on popular evaluation metrics, such as Dice score coefficient, Hausdorff distance at percentile 95 (HD95), classification accuracy, and mean square error. The results suggest that the proposed method offers robust tumor segmentation and survival prediction, respectively. Furthermore, the tumor classification results in this work is ranked at second place in the testing phase of the 2019 CPM-RadPath global challenge.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Prediction of vascular aging based on smartphone acquired PPG signals,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-76816-6,12 Nov 2020,"Photoplethysmography (PPG) measured by smartphone has the potential for a large scale, non-invasive, and easy-to-use screening tool. Vascular aging is linked to increased arterial stiffness, which can be measured by PPG. We investigate the feasibility of using PPG to predict healthy vascular aging (HVA) based on two approaches: machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL). We performed data preprocessing, including detrending, demodulating, and denoising on the raw PPG signals. For ML, ridge penalized regression has been applied to 38 features extracted from PPG, whereas for DL several convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been applied to the whole PPG signals as input. The analysis has been conducted using the crowd-sourced Heart for Heart data. The prediction performance of ML using two features (AUC of 94.7%) – the a wave of the second derivative PPG and tpr, including four covariates, sex, height, weight, and smoking – was similar to that of the best performing CNN, 12-layer ResNet (AUC of 95.3%). Without having the heavy computational cost of DL, ML might be advantageous in finding potential biomarkers for HVA prediction.

Post-exertional malaise (PEM), defined as the exacerbation of the patient's symptoms following minimal physical or mental stress, is a hallmark of ME/CFS. While multiple case definitions exist, there is currently no well-established biomarkers or laboratory tests to diagnose ME/CFS. Our study aimed to investigate circulating microRNA expression in severely ill ME/CFS patients before and after an innovative stress challenge that stimulates PEM. Our findings highlight the differential expression of eleven microRNAs associated with a physiological response to PEM. The present study uncovers specific microRNA expression signatures associated with ME/CFS in response to PEM induction and reports microRNA expression patterns associated to specific symptom severities. The identification of distinctive microRNA expression signatures for ME/CFS through a provocation challenge is essential for the elucidation of the ME/CFS pathophysiology, and lead to accurate diagnoses, prevention measures, and effective treatment options.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Intra-individual variability of eGFR trajectories in early diabetic kidney disease and lack of performance of prognostic biomarkers,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-76773-0,12 Nov 2020,"Studies reporting on biomarkers aiming to predict adverse renal outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes and kidney disease (DKD) conventionally define a surrogate endpoint either as a percentage of decrease of eGFR (e.g. ≥ 30%) or an absolute decline (e.g. ≥ 5 ml/min/year). The application of those study results in clinical practise however relies on the assumption of a linear and intra-individually stable progression of DKD. We studied 860 patients of the PROVALID study and 178 of an independent population with a relatively preserved eGFR at baseline and at least 5 years of follow up. Individuals with a detrimental prognosis were identified using various thresholds of a percentage or absolute decline of eGFR after each year of follow up. Next, we determined how many of the patients met the same criteria at other points in time. Interindividual eGFR decline was highly variable but in addition intra-individual eGFR trajectories also were frequently non-linear. For example, of all subjects reaching an endpoint defined as a decrease of eGFR by ≥ 30% between baseline and 3 years of follow up, only 60.3 and 45.2% lost at least the same amount between baseline and year 4 or 5. The results were similar when only patients on stable medication or subpopulations based on baseline eGFR or albuminuria status were analyzed or an eGFR decline of ≥ 5 ml/min/1.73m2/year was used. Identification of reliable biomarkers predicting adverse prognosis is a strong clinical need given the large interindividual variability of DKD progression. However, it is conceptually challenging in early DKD because of non-linear intra-individual eGFR trajectories. As a result, the performance of a prognostic biomarker may be accurate after a specific time of follow-up in a single population only.",Conclusions not available,Traditional ML,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Predictive modeling of proliferative vitreoretinopathy using automated machine learning by ophthalmologists without coding experience,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-76665-3,11 Nov 2020,"We aimed to assess the feasibility of machine learning (ML) algorithm design to predict proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) by ophthalmologists without coding experience using automated ML (AutoML). The study was a retrospective cohort study of 506 eyes who underwent pars plana vitrectomy for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) by a single surgeon at a tertiary-care hospital between 2012 and 2019. Two ophthalmologists without coding experience used an interactive application in MATLAB to build and evaluate ML algorithms for the prediction of postoperative PVR using clinical data from the electronic health records. The clinical features associated with postoperative PVR were determined by univariate feature selection. The area under the curve (AUC) for predicting postoperative PVR was better for models that included pre-existing PVR as an input. The quadratic support vector machine (SVM) model built using all selected clinical features had an AUC of 0.90, a sensitivity of 63.0%, and a specificity of 97.8%. An optimized Naïve Bayes algorithm that did not include pre-existing PVR as an input feature had an AUC of 0.81, a sensitivity of 54.3%, and a specificity of 92.4%. In conclusion, the development of ML models for the prediction of PVR by ophthalmologists without coding experience is feasible.

A total of 131 subjects with MRI (66 TLE patients [35 right and 31 left TLE] and 65 healthy controls [HC]) were allocated to training (n = 90) and test (n = 41) sets. Radiomics features (n = 186) from the bilateral hippocampi were extracted from T1-weighted images. After feature selection, machine learning models were trained. The performance of the classifier was validated in the test set to differentiate TLE from HC and ipsilateral TLE from HC. Identical processes were performed to differentiate right TLE from HC (training set, n = 69; test set; n = 31) and left TLE from HC (training set, n = 66; test set, n = 30). The best-performing model for identifying TLE showed an AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 0.848, 84.8%, 76.2%, and 75.0% in the test set, respectively. The best-performing radiomics models for identifying right TLE and left TLE subgroups showed AUCs of 0.845 and 0.840 in the test set, respectively.

Generating high-fidelity synthetic patient data for assessing machine learning healthcare software,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-020-00353-9,09 Nov 2020,"There is a growing demand for the uptake of modern artificial intelligence technologies within healthcare systems. Many of these technologies exploit historical patient health data to build powerful predictive models that can be used to improve diagnosis and understanding of disease. However, there are many issues concerning patient privacy that need to be accounted for in order to enable this data to be better harnessed by all sectors. One approach that could offer a method of circumventing privacy issues is the creation of realistic synthetic data sets that capture as many of the complexities of the original data set (distributions, non-linear relationships, and noise) but that does not actually include any real patient data. While previous research has explored models for generating synthetic data sets, here we explore the integration of resampling, probabilistic graphical modelling, latent variable identification, and outlier analysis for producing realistic synthetic data based on UK primary care patient data. In particular, we focus on handling missingness, complex interactions between variables, and the resulting sensitivity analysis statistics from machine learning classifiers, while quantifying the risks of patient re-identification from synthetic datapoints. We show that, through our approach of integrating outlier analysis with graphical modelling and resampling, we can achieve synthetic data sets that are not significantly different from original ground truth data in terms of feature distributions, feature dependencies, and sensitivity analysis statistics when inferring machine learning classifiers. What is more, the risk of generating synthetic data that is identical or very similar to real patients is shown to be low.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Prediction of age and brachial-ankle pulse-wave velocity using ultra-wide-field pseudo-color images by deep learning,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-76513-4,09 Nov 2020,"This study examined whether age and brachial-ankle pulse-wave velocity (baPWV) can be predicted with ultra-wide-field pseudo-color (UWPC) images using deep learning (DL). We examined 170 UWPC images of both eyes of 85 participants (40 men and 45 women, mean age: 57.5 ± 20.9 years). Three types of images were included (total, central, and peripheral) and analyzed by k-fold cross-validation (k = 5) using Visual Geometry Group-16. After bias was eliminated using the generalized linear mixed model, the standard regression coefficients (SRCs) between actual age and baPWV and predicted age and baPWV from the UWPC images by the neural network were calculated, and the prediction accuracies of the DL model for age and baPWV were examined. The SRC between actual age and predicted age by the neural network was 0.833 for all images, 0.818 for central images, and 0.649 for peripheral images (all P < 0.001) and between the actual baPWV and the predicted baPWV was 0.390 for total images, 0.419 for central images, and 0.312 for peripheral images (all P < 0.001). These results show the potential prediction capability of DL for age and vascular aging and could be useful for disease prevention and early treatment.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
MLL4-associated condensates counterbalance Polycomb-mediated nuclear mechanical stress in Kabuki syndrome,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-020-00724-8,09 Nov 2020,"The genetic elements required to tune gene expression are partitioned in active and repressive nuclear condensates. Chromatin compartments include transcriptional clusters whose dynamic establishment and functioning depend on multivalent interactions occurring among transcription factors, cofactors and basal transcriptional machinery. However, how chromatin players contribute to the assembly of transcriptional condensates is poorly understood. By interrogating the effect of KMT2D (also known as MLL4) haploinsufficiency in Kabuki syndrome, we found that mixed lineage leukemia 4 (MLL4) contributes to the assembly of transcriptional condensates through liquid–liquid phase separation. MLL4 loss of function impaired Polycomb-dependent chromatin compartmentalization, altering the nuclear architecture. By releasing the nuclear mechanical stress through inhibition of the mechanosensor ATR, we re-established the mechanosignaling of mesenchymal stem cells and their commitment towards chondrocytes both in vitro and in vivo. This study supports the notion that, in Kabuki syndrome, the haploinsufficiency of MLL4 causes an altered functional partitioning of chromatin, which determines the architecture and mechanical properties of the nucleus.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Clustering of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease based on genetic burden of shared molecular mechanisms,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-76200-4,05 Nov 2020,"One of the visions of precision medicine has been to re-define disease taxonomies based on molecular characteristics rather than on phenotypic evidence. However, achieving this goal is highly challenging, specifically in neurology. Our contribution is a machine-learning based joint molecular subtyping of Alzheimer’s (AD) and Parkinson’s Disease (PD), based on the genetic burden of 15 molecular mechanisms comprising 27 proteins (e.g. APOE) that have been described in both diseases. We demonstrate that our joint AD/PD clustering using a combination of sparse autoencoders and sparse non-negative matrix factorization is reproducible and can be associated with significant differences of AD and PD patient subgroups on a clinical, pathophysiological and molecular level. Hence, clusters are disease-associated. To our knowledge this work is the first demonstration of a mechanism based stratification in the field of neurodegenerative diseases. Overall, we thus see this work as an important step towards a molecular mechanism-based taxonomy of neurological disorders, which could help in developing better targeted therapies in the future by going beyond classical phenotype based disease definitions.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Prediction of mortality in severe acute malnutrition in hospitalized children by faecal volatile organic compound analysis: proof of concept,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-75515-6,05 Nov 2020,"Children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) display immature, altered gut microbiota and have a high mortality risk. Faecal volatile organic compounds (VOCs) reflect the microbiota composition and may provide insight into metabolic dysfunction that occurs in SAM. Here we determine whether analysis of faecal VOCs could identify children with SAM with increased risk of mortality. VOC profiles from children who died within six days following admission were compared to those who were discharged alive using machine learning algorithms. VOC profiles of children who died could be separated from those who were discharged with fair accuracy (AUC) = 0.71; 95% CI 0.59–0.87; P = 0.004). We present the first study showing differences in faecal VOC profiles between children with SAM who survived and those who died.

Mucosal microbiota and gene expression are associated with long-term remission after discontinuation of adalimumab in ulcerative colitis,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-76175-2,05 Nov 2020,"Given that sustained remission is the ultimate treatment goal in the management of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), the decision to stop anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) treatment in UC patients is difficult. The aim of this study was to evaluate mucosal microbiota and gene expression profiles associated with long-term remission after discontinuation of anti-TNF therapy. In nine UC patients who received anti-TNF therapy for 6 months, microbiota isolated from uninflamed mucosae and gene expression in inflamed and uninflamed mucosae were investigated at week 0 and at week 24. At treatment initiation, Fusobacterium sp. and Veillonella dispar were over-represented in the relapse group compared with the non-relapse group. After treatment, Dorea sp. and Lachnospira sp. were over-represented in the non-relapse group. In the relapse group only, a significant shift in gut bacterial community composition was found between week 0 and week 24. Gene expression of ALIX (PDCD6IP) and SLC9A3 was significantly higher in the non-relapse group than in the relapse group. Lastly, we used machine learning methods to identify relevant gene signatures associated with sustained remission. Statistical analyses of microbiota and expression profiles revealed differences between UC patients who did or did not keep remission after the discontinuation of TNF inhibitors.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Deep learning classification of early normal-tension glaucoma and glaucoma suspects using Bruch’s membrane opening-minimum rim width and RNFL,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-76154-7,04 Nov 2020,"We aimed to classify early normal-tension glaucoma (NTG) and glaucoma suspect (GS) using Bruch’s membrane opening-minimum rim width (BMO-MRW), peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), and the color classification of RNFL based on a deep-learning model. Discriminating early-stage glaucoma and GS is challenging and a deep-learning model may be helpful to clinicians. NTG accounts for an average 77% of open-angle glaucoma in Asians. BMO-MRW is a new structural parameter that has advantages in assessing neuroretinal rim tissue more accurately than conventional parameters. A dataset consisted of 229 eyes out of 277 GS and 168 eyes of 285 patients with early NTG. A deep-learning algorithm was developed to discriminate between GS and early NTG using a training set, and its accuracy was validated in the testing dataset using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC). The deep neural network model (DNN) achieved highest diagnostic performance, with an AUC of 0.966 (95%confidence interval 0.929–1.000) in classifying either GS or early NTG, while AUCs of 0.927–0.947 were obtained by other machine-learning models. The performance of the DNN model considering all three OCT-based parameters was the highest (AUC 0.966) compared to the combinations of just two parameters. As a single parameter, BMO-MRW (0.959) performed better than RNFL alone (0.914).",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

The clinical and laboratory data were collected for statistical analysis. The texture features of the Non-focus area of the first chest CT of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were extracted, and then the classification model of the first chest CT of COVID-19 pneumonia was constructed by using these texture features based on the Auto-ML method of radiomics, The area under curve(AUC), true positive rate(TPR), true negative rate (TNR), positive predictive value(PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the operating characteristic curve (ROC) were used to evaluate the accuracy of the first chest CT image classification model in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. The TPR, TNR, PPV, NPV and AUC of the training cohort and test cohort of the moderate group and the control group, the severe group and the control group, the moderate group and the severe group were all greater than 95% and 0.95 respectively. The non-focus area of the first CT image of COVID-19 pneumonia has obvious difference in different clinical types.

ADHD is associated with gambling disorder and obesity, showing overlaps of about 20% with each diagnosis. It is important for clinical practice to differentiate between conditions displaying similar symptoms via established diagnostic instruments. Applying the LightGBM algorithm in machine learning, we were able to differentiate subjects with ADHD, obesity, problematic gambling, and a control group using all 26 items of the Conners’ Adult ADHD Rating Scales (CAARS-S: S) with a global accuracy of .80; precision (positive predictive value) ranged between .78 (gambling) and .92 (obesity), recall (sensitivity) between .58 for obesity and .87 for ADHD.

Prediction of amyloid β PET positivity using machine learning in patients with suspected cerebral amyloid angiopathy markers,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-75664-8,02 Nov 2020,"Amyloid-β(Aβ) PET positivity in patients with suspected cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) MRI markers is predictive of a worse cognitive trajectory, and it provides insights into the underlying vascular pathology (CAA vs. hypertensive angiopathy) to facilitate prognostic prediction and appropriate treatment decisions. In this study, we applied two interpretable machine learning algorithms, gradient boosting machine (GBM) and random forest (RF), to predict Aβ PET positivity in patients with CAA MRI markers. In the GBM algorithm, the number of lobar cerebral microbleeds (CMBs), deep CMBs, lacunes, CMBs in dentate nuclei, and age were ranked as the most influential to predict Aβ positivity. In the RF algorithm, the absence of diabetes was additionally chosen. Cut-off values of the above variables predictive of Aβ positivity were as follows: (1) the number of lobar CMBs > 16.4(GBM)/14.3(RF), (2) no deep CMBs(GBM/RF), (3) the number of lacunes > 7.4(GBM/RF), (4) age > 74.3(GBM)/64(RF), (5) no CMBs in dentate nucleus(GBM/RF). The classification performances based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve were 0.83 in GBM and 0.80 in RF. Our study demonstrates the utility of interpretable machine learning in the clinical setting by quantifying the relative importance and cutoff values of predictive variables for Aβ positivity in patients with suspected CAA markers.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

We built a deep learning system model to diagnose CSC, and distinguish chronic from acute CSC using spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) images. Data from SD-OCT images of patients with CSC and a control group were analyzed with a convolutional neural network. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) were used to evaluate the model. For CSC diagnosis, our model showed an accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 93.8%, 90.0%, and 99.1%, respectively; AUROC was 98.9% (95% CI, 0.983–0.995); and its diagnostic performance was comparable with VGG-16, Resnet-50, and the diagnoses of five different ophthalmologists. For distinguishing chronic from acute cases, the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were 97.6%, 100.0%, and 92.6%, respectively; AUROC was 99.4% (95% CI, 0.985–1.000); performance was better than VGG-16 and Resnet-50, and was as good as the ophthalmologists. Our model performed well when diagnosing CSC and yielded highly accurate results when distinguishing between acute and chronic cases.

Performance and clinical utility of supervised machine-learning approaches in detecting familial hypercholesterolaemia in primary care,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-020-00349-5,30 Oct 2020,"Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is a common inherited disorder, causing lifelong elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Most individuals with FH remain undiagnosed, precluding opportunities to prevent premature heart disease and death. Some machine-learning approaches improve detection of FH in electronic health records, though clinical impact is under-explored. We assessed performance of an array of machine-learning approaches for enhancing detection of FH, and their clinical utility, within a large primary care population. A retrospective cohort study was done using routine primary care clinical records of 4,027,775 individuals from the United Kingdom with total cholesterol measured from 1 January 1999 to 25 June 2019. Predictive accuracy of five common machine-learning algorithms (logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting machines, neural networks and ensemble learning) were assessed for detecting FH. Predictive accuracy was assessed by area under the receiver operating curves (AUC) and expected vs observed calibration slope; with clinical utility assessed by expected case-review workload and likelihood ratios. There were 7928 incident diagnoses of FH. In addition to known clinical features of FH (raised total cholesterol or LDL-C and family history of premature coronary heart disease), machine-learning (ML) algorithms identified features such as raised triglycerides which reduced the likelihood of FH. Apart from logistic regression (AUC, 0.81), all four other ML approaches had similarly high predictive accuracy (AUC > 0.89). Calibration slope ranged from 0.997 for gradient boosting machines to 1.857 for logistic regression. Among those screened, high probability cases requiring clinical review varied from 0.73% using ensemble learning to 10.16% using deep learning, but with positive predictive values of 15.5% and 2.8% respectively. Ensemble learning exhibited a dominant positive likelihood ratio (45.5) compared to all other ML models (7.0–14.4). Machine-learning models show similar high accuracy in detecting FH, offering opportunities to increase diagnosis. However, the clinical case-finding workload required for yield of cases will differ substantially between models.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Deep learning from “passive feeding” to “selective eating” of real-world data,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-020-00350-y,30 Oct 2020,"Artificial intelligence (AI) based on deep learning has shown excellent diagnostic performance in detecting various diseases with good-quality clinical images. Recently, AI diagnostic systems developed from ultra-widefield fundus (UWF) images have become popular standard-of-care tools in screening for ocular fundus diseases. However, in real-world settings, these systems must base their diagnoses on images with uncontrolled quality (“passive feeding”), leading to uncertainty about their performance. Here, using 40,562 UWF images, we develop a deep learning–based image filtering system (DLIFS) for detecting and filtering out poor-quality images in an automated fashion such that only good-quality images are transferred to the subsequent AI diagnostic system (“selective eating”). In three independent datasets from different clinical institutions, the DLIFS performed well with sensitivities of 96.9%, 95.6% and 96.6%, and specificities of 96.6%, 97.9% and 98.8%, respectively. Furthermore, we show that the application of our DLIFS significantly improves the performance of established AI diagnostic systems in real-world settings. Our work demonstrates that “selective eating” of real-world data is necessary and needs to be considered in the development of image-based AI systems.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Patients who have recovered from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) could profoundly impact the health care system. We sought to define the kinetics and relevance of PCR-positive recurrence during recovery from acute COVID-19 to better understand risks for prolonged infectivity and reinfection. A series of 414 patients with confirmed SARS-Cov-2 infection, at The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, China from January 11 to April 23, 2020. Statistical analyses were performed of the clinical, laboratory, radiologic image, medical treatment, and clinical course of admission/quarantine/readmission data, and a recurrence predictive algorithm was developed. 16.7% recovered patients with PCR positive recurring one to three times, despite being in strict quarantine. Younger patients with mild pulmonary respiratory syndrome had higher risk of PCR positivity recurrence. The recurrence prediction model had an area under the ROC curve of 0.786. This case series provides characteristics of patients with recurrent SARS-CoV-2 positivity.

Predicting stroke severity with a 3-min recording from the Muse portable EEG system for rapid diagnosis of stroke,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-75379-w,28 Oct 2020,"In this study, we demonstrated the use of low-cost portable electroencephalography (EEG) as a method for prehospital stroke diagnosis. We used a portable EEG system to record data from 25 participants, 16 had acute ischemic stroke events, and compared the results to age-matched controls that included stroke mimics. Delta/alpha ratio (DAR), (delta + theta)/(alpha + beta) ratio (DBATR) and pairwise-derived Brain Symmetry Index (pdBSI) were investigated, as well as head movement using the on-board accelerometer and gyroscope. We then used machine learning to distinguish between different subgroups. DAR and DBATR increased in ischemic stroke patients with increasing stroke severity (p = 0.0021, partial η2 = 0.293; p = 0.01, partial η2 = 0.234). Also, pdBSI decreased in low frequencies and increased in high frequencies in patients who had a stroke (p = 0.036, partial η2 = 0.177). Using classification trees, we were able to distinguish moderate to severe stroke patients and from minor stroke and controls, with a 63% sensitivity, 86% specificity and accuracy of 76%. There are significant differences in DAR, DBATR, and pdBSI between patients with ischemic stroke when compared to controls, and these effects scale with severity. We have shown the utility of a low-cost portable EEG system to aid in patient triage and diagnosis as an early detection tool.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

In organ transplantation, delayed graft function (DGF) remains a major concern in deceased donor kidney transplantation (DDKT). To this end, we harnessed ML to build personalized prognostic models to predict DGF. Registry data were obtained on adult DDKT recipients for model development (n = 55,044) and validation (n = 6176). Incidence rates of DGF were 25.1% and 26.3% for the development and validation sets, respectively. Twenty-six predictors were identified via recursive feature elimination with random forest. Five widely-used ML algorithms—logistic regression (LR), elastic net, random forest, artificial neural network (ANN), and extreme gradient boosting (XGB) were trained and compared with a baseline LR model fitted with previously identified risk factors. The new ML models, particularly ANN with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) of 0.732 and XGB with ROC-AUC of 0.735, exhibited superior performance to the baseline model (ROC-AUC = 0.705). This study demonstrates the use of ML as a viable strategy to enable personalized risk quantification for medical applications.

We evaluate the use of a deep neural network for the detection of endoleak on CTA for post-EVAR patients using a novel data efficient training approach. 50 CTAs and 20 CTAs with and without endoleak respectively were identified based on gold standard interpretation by a cardiovascular subspecialty radiologist. The Endoleak Augmentor, a custom designed augmentation method, provided robust training for the machine learning (ML) model. Predicted segmentation maps underwent post-processing to determine the presence of endoleak. The model was tested against 3 blinded general radiologists and 1 blinded subspecialist using a held-out subset (10 positive endoleak CTAs, 10 control CTAs). Model accuracy, precision and recall for endoleak diagnosis were 95%, 90% and 100% relative to reference subspecialist interpretation (AUC = 0.99). Accuracy, precision and recall was 70/70/70% for generalist1, 50/50/90% for generalist2, and 90/83/100% for generalist3. The blinded subspecialist had concordant interpretations for all test cases compared with the reference.

Currently its use is limited mainly due to lack of experience in interpretation of the smears. We developed a deep learning model, TzanckNet, that can identify cells in Tzanck smear test findings. TzanckNet was trained on a retrospective development dataset of 2260 Tzanck smear images collected between December 2006 and December 2019. The finalized model was evaluated using a prospective validation dataset of 359 Tzanck smear images collected from 15 patients during January 2020. It is designed to recognize six cell types (acantholytic cells, eosinophils, hypha, multinucleated giant cells, normal keratinocytes and tadpole cells). For 359 images and 6 cell types, TzanckNet made 2154 predictions. The accuracy was 94.3% (95% CI 93.4–95.3), the sensitivity was 83.7% (95% CI 80.3–87.0) and the specificity was 97.3% (95% CI 96.5–98.1).

We use SWIR-MPI to monitor clinically important physiological processes including edema, inflammation, and tumor lipid heterogeneity in preclinical models. We also show that SWIR-MPI can spatially map blood-lipids in humans, representing an example of non-invasive and contact-free measurements of in vivo blood lipids.

The proposed algorithm was trained end-to-end directly using 5,325 ocular surface images from a retrospective dataset. Finally, the algorithm’s performance was tested against 10 ophthalmologists in a prospective clinic-based dataset with 510 outpatients newly enrolled with diseases of infectious keratitis, non-infectious keratitis, corneal dystrophy or degeneration, and corneal neoplasm. The area under the ROC curve of the algorithm for each corneal disease type was over 0.910 and in general it had sensitivity and specificity similar to or better than the average values of all ophthalmologists. Confusion matrices revealed similarities in misclassification between human experts and the algorithm.

Large-scale biometry with interpretable neural network regression on UK Biobank body MRI,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-74633-5,20 Oct 2020,"In a large-scale medical examination, the UK Biobank study has successfully imaged more than 32,000 volunteer participants with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Each scan is linked to extensive metadata, providing a comprehensive medical survey of imaged anatomy and related health states. Despite its potential for research, this vast amount of data presents a challenge to established methods of evaluation, which often rely on manual input. To date, the range of reference values for cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors is therefore incomplete. In this work, neural networks were trained for image-based regression to infer various biological metrics from the neck-to-knee body MRI automatically. The approach requires no manual intervention or direct access to reference segmentations for training. The examined fields span 64 variables derived from anthropometric measurements, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), atlas-based segmentations, and dedicated liver scans. With the ResNet50, the standardized framework achieves a close fit to the target values (median R\(^2 > 0.97\)) in cross-validation. Interpretation of aggregated saliency maps suggests that the network correctly targets specific body regions and limbs, and learned to emulate different modalities. On several body composition metrics, the quality of the predictions is within the range of variability observed between established gold standard techniques.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: ; Attacker Capability: 
Interferons and viruses induce a novel truncated ACE2 isoform and not the full-length SARS-CoV-2 receptor,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-020-00731-9,19 Oct 2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19, utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for entry into target cells. ACE2 has been proposed as an interferon-stimulated gene (ISG). Thus, interferon-induced variability in ACE2 expression levels could be important for susceptibility to COVID-19 or its outcomes. Here, we report the discovery of a novel, transcriptionally independent truncated isoform of ACE2, which we designate as deltaACE2 (dACE2). We demonstrate that dACE2, but not ACE2, is an ISG. In The Cancer Genome Atlas, the expression of dACE2 was enriched in squamous tumors of the respiratory, gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts.

Deep learning algorithms for detecting and visualising intussusception on plain abdominal radiography in children: a retrospective multicenter study,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-74653-1,16 Oct 2020,"This study aimed to verify a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm to detect intussusception in children using a human-annotated data set of plain abdominal X-rays from affected children. From January 2005 to August 2019, 1449 images were collected from plain abdominal X-rays of patients ≤ 6 years old who were diagnosed with intussusception while 9935 images were collected from patients without intussusception from three tertiary academic hospitals (A, B, and C data sets). Single Shot MultiBox Detector and ResNet were used for abdominal detection and intussusception classification, respectively. The diagnostic performance of the algorithm was analysed using internal and external validation tests. The internal test values after training with two hospital data sets were 0.946 to 0.971 for the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), 0.927 to 0.952 for the highest accuracy, and 0.764 to 0.848 for the highest Youden index. The values from external test using the remaining data set were all lower (P-value < 0.001). The mean values of the internal test with all data sets were 0.935 and 0.743 for the AUC and Youden Index, respectively. Detection of intussusception by deep CNN and plain abdominal X-rays could aid in screening for intussusception in children.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Integration of geoscience frameworks into digital pathology analysis permits quantification of microarchitectural relationships in histological landscapes,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-74691-9,16 Oct 2020,"Although gold-standard histological assessment is subjective it remains central to diagnosis and clinical trial protocols and is crucial for the evaluation of any preclinical disease model. Objectivity and reproducibility are enhanced by quantitative analysis of histological images but current methods require application-specific algorithm training and fail to extract understanding from the histological context of observable features. We reinterpret histopathological images as disease landscapes to describe a generalisable framework defining topographic relationships in tissue using geoscience approaches. The framework requires no user-dependent training to operate on all image datasets in a classifier-agnostic manner but is adaptable and scalable, able to quantify occult abnormalities, derive mechanistic insights, and define a new feature class for machine-learning diagnostic classification. We demonstrate application to inflammatory, fibrotic and neoplastic disease in multiple organs, including the detection and quantification of occult lobular enlargement in the liver secondary to hilar obstruction. We anticipate this approach will provide a robust class of histological data for trial stratification or endpoints, provide quantitative endorsement of experimental models of disease, and could be incorporated within advanced approaches to clinical diagnostic pathology.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

From two public datasets, 1248 CXR images were obtained, which included 215, 533, and 500 CXR images of COVID-19 pneumonia patients, non-COVID-19 pneumonia patients, and the healthy samples, respectively. The proposed CADx system utilized VGG16 as a pre-trained model and combination of conventional method and mixup as data augmentation methods. Other types of pre-trained models were compared with the VGG16-based model. Single type or no data augmentation methods were also evaluated. Splitting of training/validation/test sets was used when building and evaluating the CADx system. Three-category accuracy was evaluated for test set with 125 CXR images. The three-category accuracy of the CAD system was 83.6% between COVID-19 pneumonia, non-COVID-19 pneumonia, and the healthy. Sensitivity for COVID-19 pneumonia was more than 90%. The combination of conventional method and mixup was more useful than single type or no data augmentation method. In conclusion, this study was able to create an accurate CADx system for the 3-category classification.

Hyperactive sensorimotor cortex during voice perception in spasmodic dysphonia,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-73450-0,14 Oct 2020,"Spasmodic dysphonia (SD) is characterized by an involuntary laryngeal muscle spasm during vocalization. Previous studies measured brain activation during voice production and suggested that SD arises from abnormal sensorimotor integration involving the sensorimotor cortex. However, it remains unclear whether this abnormal sensorimotor activation merely reflects neural activation produced by abnormal vocalization. To identify the specific neural correlates of SD, we used a sound discrimination task without overt vocalization to compare neural activation between 11 patients with SD and healthy participants. Participants underwent functional MRI during a two-alternative judgment task for auditory stimuli, which could be modal or falsetto voice. Since vocalization in falsetto is intact in SD, we predicted that neural activation during speech perception would differ between the two groups only for modal voice and not for falsetto voice. Group-by-stimulus interaction was observed in the left sensorimotor cortex and thalamus, suggesting that voice perception activates different neural systems between the two groups. Moreover, the sensorimotor signals positively correlated with disease severity of SD, and classified the two groups with 73% accuracy in linear discriminant analysis. Thus, the sensorimotor cortex and thalamus play a central role in SD pathophysiology and sensorimotor signals can be a new biomarker for SD diagnosis.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
A critical evaluation of visual proportion of Gleason 4 and maximum cancer core length quantified by histopathologists,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-73524-z,14 Oct 2020,"Gleason score 7 prostate cancer with a higher proportion of pattern 4 (G4) has been linked to genomic heterogeneity and poorer patient outcome. The current assessment of G4 proportion uses estimation by a pathologist, with a higher proportion of G4 more likely to trigger additional imaging and treatment over active surveillance. This estimation method has been shown to have inter-observer variability. Fifteen patients with Prostate Grade Group (GG) 2 (Gleason 3 + 4) and fifteen patients with GG3 (Gleason 4 + 3) disease were selected from the PROMIS study with 192 haematoxylin and eosin-stained slides scanned. Two experienced uropathologists assessed the maximum cancer core length (MCCL) and G4 proportion using the current standard method (visual estimation) followed by detailed digital manual annotation of each G4 area and measurement of MCCL (planimetric estimation) using freely available software by the same two experts. We aimed to compare visual estimation of G4 and MCCL to a pathologist-driven digital measurement. We show that the visual and digital MCCL measurement differs up to 2 mm in 76.6% (23/30) with a high degree of agreement between the two measurements; Visual gave a median MCCL of 10 ± 2.70 mm (IQR 4, range 5–15 mm) compared to digital of 9.88 ± 3.09 mm (IQR 3.82, range 5.01–15.7 mm) (p = 0.64) The visual method for assessing G4 proportion over-estimates in all patients, compared to digital measurements [median 11.2% (IQR 38.75, range 4.7–17.9%) vs 30.4% (IQR 18.37, range 12.9–50.76%)]. The discordance was higher as the amount of G4 increased (Bias 18.71, CI 33.87–48.75, r 0.7, p < 0.0001). Further work on assessing actual G4 burden calibrated to clinical outcomes might lead to the use of differing G4 thresholds of significance if the visual estimation is used or by incorporating semi-automated methods for G4 burden measurement.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
"Survival prediction of patients with sepsis from age, sex, and septic episode number alone",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-73558-3,13 Oct 2020,"Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by an exaggerated reaction of the body to an infection, that leads to organ failure or even death. Since sepsis can kill a patient even in just one hour, survival prediction is an urgent priority among the medical community: even if laboratory tests and hospital analyses can provide insightful information about the patient, in fact, they might not come in time to allow medical doctors to recognize an immediate death risk and treat it properly. In this context, machine learning can be useful to predict survival of patients within minutes, especially when applied to few medical features easily retrievable. In this study, we show that it is possible to achieve this goal by applying computational intelligence algorithms to three features of patients with sepsis, recorded at hospital admission: sex, age, and septic episode number. We applied several data mining methods to a cohort of 110,204 admissions of patients, and obtained high prediction scores both on this complete dataset (top precision-recall area under the curve PR AUC = 0.966) and on its subset related to the recent Sepsis-3 definition (top PR AUC = 0.860). Additionally, we tested our models on an external validation cohort of 137 patients, and achieved good results in this case too (top PR AUC = 0.863), confirming the generalizability of our approach. Our results can have a huge impact on clinical settings, allowing physicians to forecast the survival of patients by sex, age, and septic episode number alone.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

BUndle ANalytics (BUAN) is a fast, robust, and flexible computational framework for real-world tractometric studies. BUAN combines tractography and anatomical information to analyze the challenging datasets and identifies significant group differences in specific locations of the white matter bundles. Additionally, BUAN takes the shape of the bundles into consideration for the analysis. BUAN compares the shapes of the bundles using a metric called bundle adjacency which calculates shape similarity between two given bundles. BUAN builds networks of bundle shape similarities that can be paramount for automating quality control. BUAN is freely available in DIPY.

Deep transfer learning for reducing health care disparities arising from biomedical data inequality,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18918-3,12 Oct 2020,"As artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly applied to biomedical research and clinical decisions, developing unbiased AI models that work equally well for all ethnic groups is of crucial importance to health disparity prevention and reduction. However, the biomedical data inequality between different ethnic groups is set to generate new health care disparities through data-driven, algorithm-based biomedical research and clinical decisions. Using an extensive set of machine learning experiments on cancer omics data, we find that current prevalent schemes of multiethnic machine learning are prone to generating significant model performance disparities between ethnic groups. We show that these performance disparities are caused by data inequality and data distribution discrepancies between ethnic groups. We also find that transfer learning can improve machine learning model performance for data-disadvantaged ethnic groups, and thus provides an effective approach to reduce health care disparities arising from data inequality among ethnic groups.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Five-year trajectories of multimorbidity patterns in an elderly Mediterranean population using Hidden Markov Models,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-73231-9,09 Oct 2020,"This study aimed to analyse the trajectories and mortality of multimorbidity patterns in patients aged 65 to 99 years in Catalonia (Spain). Five year (2012–2016) data of 916,619 participants from a primary care, population-based electronic health record database (Information System for Research in Primary Care, SIDIAP) were included in this retrospective cohort study. Individual longitudinal trajectories were modelled with a Hidden Markov Model across multimorbidity patterns. We computed the mortality hazard using Cox regression models to estimate survival in multimorbidity patterns. Ten multimorbidity patterns were originally identified and two more states (death and drop-outs) were subsequently added. At baseline, the most frequent cluster was the Non-Specific Pattern (42%), and the least frequent the Multisystem Pattern (1.6%). Most participants stayed in the same cluster over the 5 year follow-up period, from 92.1% in the Nervous, Musculoskeletal pattern to 59.2% in the Cardio-Circulatory and Renal pattern. The highest mortality rates were observed for patterns that included cardio-circulatory diseases: Cardio-Circulatory and Renal (37.1%); Nervous, Digestive and Circulatory (31.8%); and Cardio-Circulatory, Mental, Respiratory and Genitourinary (28.8%). This study demonstrates the feasibility of characterizing multimorbidity patterns along time. Multimorbidity trajectories were generally stable, although changes in specific multimorbidity patterns were observed. The Hidden Markov Model is useful for modelling transitions across multimorbidity patterns and mortality risk. Our findings suggest that health interventions targeting specific multimorbidity patterns may reduce mortality in patients with multimorbidity.","Four main aspects differentiate and characterise the ten multimorbidity patterns observed: (1) the proportion of women was higher in C2-Eye Impairment and Mental; C4-Cardio-circulatory and Renal; C7-Respiratory and Ear; and C9-Nervous, Musculoskeletal, and Minor, whereas men predominated in C5-Cardio-circulatory, Mental, Respiratory and Genitourinary; (2) the highest mortality rates were observed for C4-Cardio-Circulatory and Renal; C6-Nervous, Digestive and Circulatory and C5-Cardio-Circulatory, Mental, Respiratory and Genitourinary; (3) trajectories were generally stable, although changes were common in certain patterns of multimorbidity; (4) most trajectories consisted of a single transition during 5 years of follow up.This study sheds light on the changing prevalence of multimorbidity patterns over time and on mortality associated with specific patterns. These data are essential for the provision of adequate healthcare for patients with multiple chronic conditions. Future studies on the trajectory of multimorbidity patterns should follow up a younger population for a longer period of time.","Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Clinical predictive modelling of post-surgical recovery in individuals with cervical radiculopathy: a machine learning approach,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-73740-7,08 Oct 2020,"Prognostic models play an important role in the clinical management of cervical radiculopathy (CR). No study has compared the performance of modern machine learning techniques, against more traditional stepwise regression techniques, when developing prognostic models in individuals with CR. We analysed a prospective cohort dataset of 201 individuals with CR. Four modelling techniques (stepwise regression, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator [LASSO], boosting, and multivariate adaptive regression splines [MuARS]) were each used to form a prognostic model for each of four outcomes obtained at a 12 month follow-up (disability—neck disability index [NDI]), quality of life (EQ5D), present neck pain intensity, and present arm pain intensity). For all four outcomes, the differences in mean performance between all four models were small (difference of NDI < 1 point; EQ5D < 0.1 point; neck and arm pain < 2 points). Given that the predictive accuracy of all four modelling methods were clinically similar, the optimal modelling method may be selected based on the parsimony of predictors. Some of the most parsimonious models were achieved using MuARS, a non-linear technique. Modern machine learning methods may be used to probe relationships along different regions of the predictor space.",Conclusions not available,Traditional ML,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Data mining and model-predicting a global disease reservoir for low-pathogenic Avian Influenza (AI) in the wider pacific rim using big data sets,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-73664-2,08 Oct 2020,"Avian Influenza (AI) is a complex but still poorly understood disease; specifically when it comes to reservoirs, co-infections, connectedness and wider landscape perspectives. Low pathogenic (Low-path LP) AI in chickens caused by less virulent strains of AI viruses (AIVs)—when compared with highly pathogenic AIVs (HPAIVs)—are not even well-described yet or known how they contribute to wider AI and immune system issues. Co-circulation of LPAIVs with HPAIVs suggests their interactions in their ecological aspects. Here we show for the Pacific Rim an international approach how to data mine and model-predict LP AI and its ecological niche with machine learning and open access data sets and geographic information systems (GIS) on a 5 km pixel size for best-possible inference. This is based on the best-available data on the issue (~ 40,827 records of lab-analyzed field data from Japan, Russia, Vietnam, Mongolia, Alaska and Influenza Research Database (IRD) and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) database sets, as well as 19 GIS data layers). We sampled 157 hosts and 110 low-path AIVs with 32 species as drivers. The prevalence across low-path AIV subtypes is dominated by Muscovy ducks, Mallards, Whistling Swans and gulls also emphasizing industrial impacts for the human-dominated wildlife contact zone.

Longitudinal assessment of U-shaped and inverted U-shaped developmental changes in the spontaneous movements of infants via markerless video analysis,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-74006-y,08 Oct 2020,"Various attempts have been made to elucidate the development patterns in the spontaneous movements of infants through longitudinal evaluations. Movement complexity has been found to demonstrate u-shaped changes in the measurements focusing on limb movements. However, researchers have not yet clarified how other characteristics, besides movement complexity, change over time. This paper presents a longitudinal evaluation of spontaneous movements in infants using evaluation indices calculated through markerless video analysis. Nine infants with corrected ages from \(-1\) to 15 weeks participated in the experiments. We confirmed the change in indices over time using statistical methods. Index changes can be classified as positively correlated, u-shaped, inverted u-shaped, and uncorrelated. We also confirmed that the u-shaped and inverted u-shaped indices are negatively correlated. Furthermore, the principal component analysis revealed that the first principal component had the inverted u-shaped changes with the corrected age. These results suggest that it is important to synchronize the inverted u-shaped variations in the movement and velocity with the u-shaped changes in the movement complexity for infant development.",Conclusions not available,Gen AI,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: ; Attacker Capability: 
A multivariate neuromonitoring approach to neuroplasticity-based computerized cognitive training in recent onset psychosis,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41386-020-00877-4,07 Oct 2020,"Two decades of studies suggest that computerized cognitive training (CCT) has an effect on cognitive improvement and the restoration of brain activity. Nevertheless, individual response to CCT remains heterogenous, and the predictive potential of neuroimaging in gauging response to CCT remains unknown. We employed multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) on whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) to (neuro)monitor clinical outcome defined as psychosis-likeness change after 10-hours of CCT in recent onset psychosis (ROP) patients. Additionally, we investigated if sensory processing (SP) change during CCT is associated with individual psychosis-likeness change and cognitive gains after CCT. 26 ROP patients were divided into maintainers and improvers based on their SP change during CCT. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier separating 56 healthy controls (HC) from 35 ROP patients using rsFC (balanced accuracy of 65.5%, P < 0.01) was built in an independent sample to create a naturalistic model representing the HC-ROP hyperplane. This model was out-of-sample cross-validated in the ROP patients from the CCT trial to assess associations between rsFC pattern change, cognitive gains and SP during CCT. Patients with intact SP threshold at baseline showed improved attention despite psychosis status on the SVM hyperplane at follow-up (p < 0.05). Contrarily, the attentional gains occurred in the ROP patients who showed impaired SP at baseline only if rsfMRI diagnosis status shifted to the healthy-like side of the SVM continuum. Our results reveal the utility of MVPA for elucidating treatment response neuromarkers based on rsFC-SP change and pave the road to more personalized interventions.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Using epidemic simulators for monitoring an ongoing epidemic,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-73308-5,06 Oct 2020,"Prediction of infection trends, estimating the efficacy of contact tracing, testing or impact of influx of infected are of vital importance for administration during an ongoing epidemic. Most effective methods currently are empirical in nature and their relation to parameters of interest to administrators are not evident. We thus propose a modified SEIRD model that is capable of modeling effect of interventions and inward migrations on the progress of an epidemic. The tunable parameters of this model bear relevance to monitoring of an epidemic. This model was used to show that some of the commonly seen features of cumulative infections in real data can be explained by piecewise constant changes in interventions and population influx. We also show that the data of cumulative infections from twelve Indian states between mid March and mid April 2020 can be generated from the model by applying interventions according to a set of heuristic rules. Prediction for the next ten days based on this model, reproduced real data very well. In addition, our model also reproduced the time series of recoveries and deaths. Our work constitutes an important first step towards an effective dashboard for the monitoring of epidemic by the administration, especially in an Indian context.",Conclusions not available,Gen AI,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Three-dimensional optoacoustic imaging of nailfold capillaries in systemic sclerosis and its potential for disease differentiation using deep learning,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-73319-2,05 Oct 2020,"The autoimmune disease systemic sclerosis (SSc) causes microvascular changes that can be easily observed cutaneously at the finger nailfold. Optoacoustic imaging (OAI), a combination of optical and ultrasound imaging, specifically raster-scanning optoacoustic mesoscopy (RSOM), offers a non-invasive high-resolution 3D visualization of capillaries allowing for a better view of microvascular changes and an extraction of volumetric measures. In this study, nailfold capillaries of patients with SSc and healthy controls are imaged and compared with each other for the first time using OAI. The nailfolds of 23 patients with SSc and 19 controls were imaged using RSOM. The acquired images were qualitatively compared to images from state-of-the-art imaging tools for SSc, dermoscopy and high magnification capillaroscopy. The vascular volume in the nailfold capillaries were computed from the RSOM images. The vascular volumes differ significantly between both cohorts (0.216 ± 0.085 mm3 and 0.337 ± 0.110 mm3; p < 0.0005). In addition, an artificial neural network was trained to automatically differentiate nailfold images from both cohorts to further assess whether OAI is sensitive enough to visualize anatomical differences in the capillaries between the two cohorts. Using transfer learning, the model classifies images with an area under the ROC curve of 0.897, and a sensitivity of 0.783 and specificity of 0.895. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the capabilities of RSOM as an imaging tool for SSc and establishes it as a modality that facilitates more in-depth studies into the disease mechanisms and progression.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Deep learning algorithms out-perform veterinary pathologists in detecting the mitotically most active tumor region,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-73246-2,05 Oct 2020,"Manual count of mitotic figures, which is determined in the tumor region with the highest mitotic activity, is a key parameter of most tumor grading schemes. It can be, however, strongly dependent on the area selection due to uneven mitotic figure distribution in the tumor section. We aimed to assess the question, how significantly the area selection could impact the mitotic count, which has a known high inter-rater disagreement. On a data set of 32 whole slide images of H&E-stained canine cutaneous mast cell tumor, fully annotated for mitotic figures, we asked eight veterinary pathologists (five board-certified, three in training) to select a field of interest for the mitotic count. To assess the potential difference on the mitotic count, we compared the mitotic count of the selected regions to the overall distribution on the slide. Additionally, we evaluated three deep learning-based methods for the assessment of highest mitotic density: In one approach, the model would directly try to predict the mitotic count for the presented image patches as a regression task. The second method aims at deriving a segmentation mask for mitotic figures, which is then used to obtain a mitotic density. Finally, we evaluated a two-stage object-detection pipeline based on state-of-the-art architectures to identify individual mitotic figures. We found that the predictions by all models were, on average, better than those of the experts. The two-stage object detector performed best and outperformed most of the human pathologists on the majority of tumor cases. The correlation between the predicted and the ground truth mitotic count was also best for this approach (0.963–0.979). Further, we found considerable differences in position selection between pathologists, which could partially explain the high variance that has been reported for the manual mitotic count. To achieve better inter-rater agreement, we propose to use a computer-based area selection for support of the pathologist in the manual mitotic count.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Here, we report the design and clinical implementation of an integrated robotic knee–ankle prosthesis that facilitates the real-world testing of its biomechanics and control strategies. The bionic leg is open source, it includes software for low-level control and for communication with control systems, and its hardware design is customizable, enabling reduction in its mass and cost, improvement in its ease of use and independent operation of the knee and ankle joints. We characterized the electromechanical and thermal performance of the bionic leg in benchtop testing, as well as its kinematics and kinetics in three individuals during walking on level ground, ramps and stairs.

However, there is significant variability in cognitive dysfunction, likely reflecting biological heterogeneity. We sought to identify neurocognitive subtypes and their neurofunctional signatures in a large cross-sectional sample of depressed youth. Participants were drawn from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort, including 712 youth with a lifetime history of a major depressive episode and 712 typically developing (TD) youth matched on age and sex. A subset (MDD n = 368, TD n = 200) also completed neuroimaging. Cognition was assessed with the Penn Computerized Neurocognitive Battery. A recently developed semi-supervised machine learning algorithm was used to delineate neurocognitive subtypes. Subtypes were evaluated for differences in both clinical psychopathology and brain activation during an n-back working memory fMRI task. We identified three neurocognitive subtypes in the depressed group. Subtype 1 was high-performing (high accuracy, moderate speed), Subtype 2 was cognitively impaired (low accuracy, slow speed), and Subtype 3 was impulsive (low accuracy, fast speed). While subtypes did not differ in clinical psychopathology, they diverged in their activation profiles in regions critical for executive function, which mirrored differences in cognition. Taken together, these data suggest disparate mechanisms of cognitive vulnerability and resilience in depressed youth, which may inform the identification of biomarkers for prognosis and treatment response.",Conclusions not available,Gen AI,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Following 12 weeks of diethylnitrosamine (DEN) and high-fat diet (HFD), wildtype (WT) and Osr1 heterozygous (Osr1+/−) male mice were examined for liver injuries. Osr1+/− mice displayed worsen liver injury with higher serum alanine aminotransferase levels than the WT mice. The Osr1+/− mice also revealed early signs of collagen deposition with increased hepatic Tgfb and Fn1 expression. There was overactivation of both JNK and NF-κB signaling in the Osr1+/− liver, along with accumulation of F4/80+ cells and enhanced hepatic expression of Il-1b and Il-6. Moreover, the Osr1+/− liver displayed hyperphosphorylation of AKT/mTOR signaling, associated with overexpression of Bcl-2. In addition, Osr1+/− and WT mice displayed differences in the DNA methylome of the liver cells. Specifically, Osr1-responsible CpG islands of Ccl3 and Pcgf2, genes for inflammation and macrophage infiltration, were further identified.

Because they are not curable, these diseases have a high impact on both the quality of life of patients and the healthcare budget. The stability of patient condition relies mostly on constant treatment adaptation and lung function monitoring. However, due to the variety of inflammation phenotypes, almost one third of the patients receive an ineffective treatment. To improve phenotyping, we evaluated the complementarity of two techniques for exhaled breath analysis: full resolving comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled to high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC × GC-HRTOFMS) and rapid screening selected ion flow tube MS (SIFT-MS). GC × GC-HRTOFMS has a high resolving power and offers a full overview of sample composition, providing deep insights on the ongoing biology. SIFT-MS is usually used for targeted analyses, allowing rapid classification of samples in defined groups. In this study, we used SIFT-MS in a possible untargeted full-scan mode, where it provides pattern-based classification capacity. We analyzed the exhaled breath of 50 asthmatic patients. Both techniques provided good classification accuracy (around 75%), similar to the efficiency of other clinical tools routinely used for asthma phenotyping. Moreover, our study provides useful information regarding the complementarity of the two techniques.",Conclusions not available,Gen AI,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
"Contact lenses, the reverse Pulfrich effect, and anti-Pulfrich monovision corrections",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-71395-y,30 Sept 2020,"Interocular differences in image blur can cause processing speed differences that lead to dramatic misperceptions of the distance and three-dimensional direction of moving objects. This recently discovered illusion—the reverse Pulfrich effect—is caused by optical conditions induced by monovision, a common correction for presbyopia. Fortunately, anti-Pulfrich monovision corrections, which darken the blurring lens, can eliminate the illusion for many viewing conditions. However, the reverse Pulfrich effect and the efficacy of anti-Pulfrich corrections have been demonstrated only with trial lenses. This situation should be addressed, for clinical and scientific reasons. First, it is important to replicate these effects with contact lenses, the most common method for delivering monovision. Second, trial lenses of different powers, unlike contacts, can cause large magnification differences between the eyes. To confidently attribute the reverse Pulfrich effect to interocular optical blur differences, and to ensure that previously reported effect sizes are reliable, one must control for magnification. Here, in a within-observer study with five separate experiments, we demonstrate that (1) contact lenses and trial lenses induce indistinguishable reverse Pulfrich effects, (2) anti-Pulfrich corrections are equally effective when induced by contact and trial lenses, and (3) magnification differences do not cause or impact the Pulfrich effect.","This manuscript shows that interocular magnification differences up to ±3.6% do not cause or impact the reverse Pulfrich effect, that the reverse Pulfrich effect can be caused by contact lenses delivering monovision corrections, and that the reverse Pulfrich effect can be eliminated with contact lenses delivering anti-Pulfrich monovision corrections. Although many questions must still be resolved before the suitability of anti-Pulfrich corrections can be determined for clinical practice, optometrists and ophthalmologists should consider making their patients aware of the reverse Pulfrich effect when prescribing monovision. Because the reverse Pulfrich effect is mediated by processing speed differences between the eyes, scientific and clinical progress will be facilitated by a computational theory that links properties of individual images to neural processing speed.","Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Birth and birth-related obstetrical characteristics in southwestern China associated with the current adjustment of family planning policy: a 7-year retrospective study,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-73039-7,29 Sept 2020,"In China, the adjustment of the family planning policy was expected to increase the number of births and trigger a change in the demographic and obstetrical background of pregnant women. The policy itself, and corresponding background variations of the pregnant mothers, might have various influences on certain birth-related characteristics. Moreover, the adaption of the medical system to the policy needs to be demonstrated. To address these issues, over 50,000 individual records from January 2012 to December 2018 were collected from a large tertiary care centre of southwest China as a representative. The monthly numbers of deliveries and births showed stabilized patterns after remarkable upward trends. Policy-sensitive women, among whom older age and multiparity were typical features, contributed considerably to the remarkable additional births. Indeed, multivariable logistic regression analysis identified the child policy and these two background characteristics as factors influencing CS (caesarean section) rate and certain pregnancy complications or adverse outcomes. After the implementation of the two-child policy, a care provider was faced with fewer but more difficult cases. Briefly speaking, more individual-based studies on family planning policy and more efforts to improve obstetrical service are needed to better guide clinical practice in the new era.","Our study, conducted in a representative hospital in southwest China, demonstrated that (1) an increase in births occurred after implementation of the two-child policy and has already stabilized; (2) a newly balanced demographic makeup of pregnant women has developed; (3) the policy target is more sensitive to additional births; (4) the policy put hospitals and care providers in a situation of lower quantity but greater difficulty work; and (5) the covariates should not be ignored when analysing the factors influencing the birth-related obstetrical characteristics.We sincerely recommend that (1) more individual-based studies be performed both to describe changes and to answer the questions mentioned above; (2) more efforts should be put into providing high-quality health care service to prevent adverse outcomes from improper operations; and (3) childbearing should be concentrated within the optimum maternal age range.",Traditional ML,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
A machine learning-based diagnostic model associated with knee osteoarthritis severity,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-72941-4,25 Sept 2020,"Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is characterized by pain and decreased gait function. We aimed to find KOA-related gait features based on patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) and develop regression models using machine learning algorithms to estimate KOA severity. The study included 375 volunteers with variable KOA grades. The severity of KOA was determined using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). WOMAC scores were used to classify disease severity into three groups. A total of 1087 features were extracted from the gait data. An ANOVA and student’s t-test were performed and only features that were significant were selected for inclusion in the machine learning algorithm. Three WOMAC subscales (physical function, pain and stiffness) were further divided into three classes. An ANOVA was performed to determine which selected features were significantly related to the subscales. Both linear regression models and a random forest regression was used to estimate patient the WOMAC scores. Forty-three features were selected based on ANOVA and student’s t-test results. The following number of features were selected from each joint: 12 from hip, 1 feature from pelvic, 17 features from knee, 9 features from ankle, 1 feature from foot, and 3 features from spatiotemporal parameters. A significance level of < 0.0001 and < 0.00003 was set for the ANOVA and t-test, respectively. The physical function, pain, and stiffness subscales were related to 41, 10, and 16 features, respectively. Linear regression models showed a correlation of 0.723 and the machine learning algorithm showed a correlation of 0.741. The severity of KOA was predicted by gait analysis features, which were incorporated to develop an objective estimation model for KOA severity. The identified features may serve as a tool to guide rehabilitation and progress assessments. In addition, the estimation model presented here suggests an approach for clinical application of gait analysis data for KOA evaluation.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
MicroRNA signatures associated with lymph node metastasis in intramucosal gastric cancer,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41379-020-00681-x,24 Sept 2020,"Although a certain proportion of intramucosal carcinomas (IMCs) of the stomach does metastasize, the majority of patients are currently treated with endoscopic resection without lymph node dissection, and this potentially veils any existing metastasis and may put some patients in danger. In this regard, biological markers from the resected IMC that can predict metastasis are warranted. Here, we discovered unique miRNA expression profiles that consist of 21 distinct miRNAs that are specifically upregulated (miR-628-5p, miR-1587, miR-3175, miR-3620-5p, miR-4459, miR-4505, miR-4507, miR-4720-5p, miR-4742-5p, and miR-6779-5p) or downregulated (miR-106b-3p, miR-125a-5p, miR-151b, miR-181d-5p, miR-486-5p, miR-500a-3p, miR-502-3p, miR-1231, miR-3609, and miR-6831-5p) in metastatic (M)-IMC compared to nonmetastatic (N)-IMC, or nonneoplastic gastric mucosa. Intriguingly, most of these selected miRNAs showed stepwise increased or decreased expression from nonneoplastic tissue to N-IMC to M-IMC. This suggests that common oncogenic mechanisms are gradually intensified during the metastatic process. Using a machine-learning algorithm, we demonstrated that such miRNA signatures could distinguish M-IMC from N-IMC. Gene ontology and pathway analysis revealed that TGF-β signaling was enriched from upregulated miRNAs, whereas E2F targets, apoptosis-related, hypoxia-related, and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways, were enriched from downregulated miRNAs. Immunohistochemical staining of samples from multiple institutions indicated that PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway components, MAPK1, phospho-p44/42 MAPK, and pS6 were highly expressed and the expression of SMAD7, a TGF-β pathway component, was decreased in M-IMC, which could aid in distinguishing M-IMC from N-IMC. The miRNA signature discovered in this study is a valuable biological marker for identifying metastatic potential of IMCs, and provides novel insights regarding the metastatic progression of IMC.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: evasion; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Serum proteins may facilitate the identification of Kawasaki disease and promote in vitro neutrophil infiltration,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-72695-z,24 Sept 2020,"Kawasaki disease (KD) usually affects the children younger than 5 years of age and subsequently causes coronary artery lesions (CALs) without timely identification and treatment. Developing a robust and fast prediction method may facilitate the timely diagnosis of KD, significantly reducing the risk of CALs in KD patients. The levels of inflammatory serum proteins dramatically vary during the onsets of many immune diseases, including in KD. However, our understanding of their pathogenic roles in KD is behind satisfaction. The purpose of this study was to evaluate candidate diagnostic serum proteins and the potential mechanism in KD using iTRAQ gel-free proteomics. We enrolled subjects and conducted iTRAQ gel-free proteomics to globally screen serum proteins followed by specific validation with ELISA. Further in vitro leukocyte trans-endothelial model was also applied to investigate the pathogenesis roles of inflammatory serum proteins. We identified six KD protein biomarkers, including Protein S100-A8 (S100A8), Protein S100-A9 (S100A9), Protein S100-A12 (S100A12), Peroxiredoxin-2 (PRDX2), Neutrophil defensin 1 (DEFA1) and Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 1 (ORM1). They enabled us to develop a high-performance KD prediction model with an auROC value of 0.94, facilitating the timely identification of KD. Further assays concluded that recombinant S100A12 protein treatment activated neutrophil surface adhesion molecules responsible for adhesion to endothelial cells. Therefore, S100A12 promoted both freshly clinically isolated neutrophils and neutrophil-like cells to infiltrate through the endothelial layer in vitro. Finally, the antibody against S100A12 may attenuate the infiltration promoted by S100A12. Our result demonstrated that evaluating S100A8, S100A9, S100A12, PRDX2, DEFA1 and ORM1 levels may be a good diagnostic tool of KD. Further in vitro study implied that S100A12 could be a potential therapeutic target for KD.",Conclusions not available,Traditional ML,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Cells of the adult human heart,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2797-4,24 Sept 2020,"Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. Advanced insights into disease mechanisms and therapeutic strategies require a deeper understanding of the molecular processes involved in the healthy heart. Knowledge of the full repertoire of cardiac cells and their gene expression profiles is a fundamental first step in this endeavour. Here, using state-of-the-art analyses of large-scale single-cell and single-nucleus transcriptomes, we characterize six anatomical adult heart regions. Our results highlight the cellular heterogeneity of cardiomyocytes, pericytes and fibroblasts, and reveal distinct atrial and ventricular subsets of cells with diverse developmental origins and specialized properties. We define the complexity of the cardiac vasculature and its changes along the arterio-venous axis. In the immune compartment, we identify cardiac-resident macrophages with inflammatory and protective transcriptional signatures. Furthermore, analyses of cell-to-cell interactions highlight different networks of macrophages, fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes between atria and ventricles that are distinct from those of skeletal muscle.

Machine learning and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk prediction in a multi-ethnic population,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-020-00331-1,23 Sept 2020,"The pooled cohort equations (PCE) predict atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk in patients with characteristics within prespecified ranges and has uncertain performance among Asians or Hispanics. It is unknown if machine learning (ML) models can improve ASCVD risk prediction across broader diverse, real-world populations. We developed ML models for ASCVD risk prediction for multi-ethnic patients using an electronic health record (EHR) database from Northern California. Our cohort included patients aged 18 years or older with no prior CVD and not on statins at baseline (n = 262,923), stratified by PCE-eligible (n = 131,721) or PCE-ineligible patients based on missing or out-of-range variables. We trained ML models [logistic regression with L2 penalty and L1 lasso penalty, random forest, gradient boosting machine (GBM), extreme gradient boosting] and determined 5-year ASCVD risk prediction, including with and without incorporation of additional EHR variables, and in Asian and Hispanic subgroups. A total of 4309 patients had ASCVD events, with 2077 in PCE-ineligible patients. GBM performance in the full cohort, including PCE-ineligible patients (area under receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) 0.835, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.825–0.846), was significantly better than that of the PCE in the PCE-eligible cohort (AUC 0.775, 95% CI: 0.755–0.794). Among patients aged 40–79, GBM performed similarly before (AUC 0.784, 95% CI: 0.759–0.808) and after (AUC 0.790, 95% CI: 0.765–0.814) incorporating additional EHR data. Overall, ML models achieved comparable or improved performance compared to the PCE while allowing risk discrimination in a larger group of patients including PCE-ineligible patients. EHR-trained ML models may help bridge important gaps in ASCVD risk prediction.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

The purpose of this paper is to develop a transfer learning radiomics (TLR) model for preoperative prediction of LNM in PTC patients in a multicenter, cross-machine, multi-operator scenario. Here we report the TLR model produces a stable LNM prediction. In the experiments of cross-validation and independent testing of the main cohort according to diagnostic time, machine, and operator, the TLR achieves an average area under the curve (AUC) of 0.90. In the other two independent cohorts, TLR also achieves 0.93 AUC, and this performance is statistically better than the other three methods according to Delong test. Decision curve analysis also proves that the TLR model brings more benefit to PTC patients than other methods.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

To date, there are a lack of high-efficiency glaucoma diagnostic tools based on visual fields (VFs). Herein, we develop and evaluate the performance of ‘iGlaucoma’, a smartphone application-based deep learning system (DLS) in detecting glaucomatous VF changes. A total of 1,614,808 data points of 10,784 VFs (5542 patients) from seven centers in China were included in this study, divided over two phases. In Phase I, 1,581,060 data points from 10,135 VFs of 5105 patients were included to train (8424 VFs), validate (598 VFs) and test (3 independent test sets—200, 406, 507 samples) the diagnostic performance of the DLS. In Phase II, using the same DLS, iGlaucoma cloud-based application further tested on 33,748 data points from 649 VFs of 437 patients from three glaucoma clinics. With reference to three experienced expert glaucomatologists, the diagnostic performance (area under curve [AUC], sensitivity and specificity) of the DLS and six ophthalmologists were evaluated in detecting glaucoma. In Phase I, the DLS outperformed all six ophthalmologists in the three test sets (AUC of 0.834–0.877, with a sensitivity of 0.831–0.922 and a specificity of 0.676–0.709). In Phase II, iGlaucoma had 0.99 accuracy in recognizing different patterns in pattern deviation probability plots region, with corresponding AUC, sensitivity and specificity of 0.966 (0.953–0.979), 0.954 (0.930–0.977), and 0.873 (0.838–0.908), respectively.

A potential biomarker for treatment stratification in psychosis: evaluation of an [18F] FDOPA PET imaging approach,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41386-020-00866-7,22 Sept 2020,"[18F]FDOPA PET imaging has shown dopaminergic function indexed as Kicer differs between antipsychotic treatment responders and non-responders. However, the theragnostic potential of this biomarker to identify non-responders has yet to be evaluated. In view of this, we aimed to evaluate this as a theragnostic test using linear and non-linear machine-learning (i.e., Bernoulli, support vector, random forest and Gaussian processes) analyses and to develop and evaluate a simplified approach, standardised uptake value ratio (SUVRc). Both [18F]FDOPA PET approaches had good test-rest reproducibility across striatal regions (Kicer ICC: 0.68–0.94, SUVRc ICC: 0.76–0.91). Both our linear and non-linear classification models showed good predictive power to distinguish responders from non-responders (receiver operating curve area under the curve for region-of-interest approach: Kicer = 0.80, SUVRc = 0.79; for voxel-wise approach using a linear support vector machine: 0.88) and similar sensitivity for identifying treatment non-responders with 100% specificity (Kicer: ~50%, SUVRc: 40–60%). Although the findings were replicated in two independent datasets, given the total sample size (n = 84) and single setting, they warrant testing in other samples and settings. Preliminary economic analysis of [18F]FDOPA PET to fast-track treatment-resistant patients with schizophrenia to clozapine indicated a potential healthcare cost saving of ~£3400 (equivalent to $4232 USD) per patient. These findings indicate [18F]FDOPA PET dopamine imaging has potential as biomarker to guide treatment choice.",Our study showed that a short [18F]FDOPA PET imaging protocol provides reliable and reproducible measures of dopamine synthesis and that it and the full dynamic [18F]FDOPA PET imaging protocol can be used to distinguish patients with schizophrenia who are unlikely to respond to first-line antipsychotic treatments from those who will respond at first episode. The classification accuracy of the proposed simplified imaging method is comparable to that from a dynamic [18F]FDOPA PET scan.

Using behavioral rhythms and multi-task learning to predict fine-grained symptoms of schizophrenia,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-71689-1,15 Sept 2020,"Schizophrenia is a severe and complex psychiatric disorder with heterogeneous and dynamic multi-dimensional symptoms. Behavioral rhythms, such as sleep rhythm, are usually disrupted in people with schizophrenia. As such, behavioral rhythm sensing with smartphones and machine learning can help better understand and predict their symptoms. Our goal is to predict fine-grained symptom changes with interpretable models. We computed rhythm-based features from 61 participants with 6,132 days of data and used multi-task learning to predict their ecological momentary assessment scores for 10 different symptom items. By taking into account both the similarities and differences between different participants and symptoms, our multi-task learning models perform statistically significantly better than the models trained with single-task learning for predicting patients’ individual symptom trajectories, such as feeling depressed, social, and calm and hearing voices. We also found different subtypes for each of the symptoms by applying unsupervised clustering to the feature weights in the models. Taken together, compared to the features used in the previous studies, our rhythm features not only improved models’ prediction accuracy but also provided better interpretability for how patients’ behavioral rhythms and the rhythms of their environments influence their symptom conditions. This will enable both the patients and clinicians to monitor how these factors affect a patient’s condition and how to mitigate the influence of these factors. As such, we envision that our solution allows early detection and early intervention before a patient’s condition starts deteriorating without requiring extra effort from patients and clinicians.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

We develop a machine learning-based clinical decision support system (CDSS) for recommending initial treatment option in HCC and predicting overall survival (OS). From hospital records of 1,021 consecutive patients with HCC treated at a single centre in Korea between January 2010 and October 2010, we collected information on 61 pretreatment variables, initial treatment, and survival status. Twenty pretreatment key variables were finally selected. We developed the CDSS from the derivation set (N = 813) using random forest method and validated it in the validation set (N = 208). Among the 1,021 patients (mean age: 56.9 years), 81.8% were male and 77.0% had positive hepatitis B BCLC stages 0, A, B, C, and D were observed in 13.4%, 26.0%, 18.0%, 36.6%, and 6.3% of patients, respectively. The six multi-step classifier model was developed for treatment decision in a hierarchical manner, and showed good performance with 81.0% of accuracy for radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or resection versus not, 88.4% for RFA versus resection, and 76.8% for TACE or not. We also developed seven survival prediction models for each treatment option.

Given a huge number of T2DM patients, it is thus increasingly important to identify the ones with high risks of CHD complication but the quantitative method is still not available. Here, we first curated a dataset of 1,273 T2DM patients including 304 and 969 ones with or without CHD, respectively. We then trained an artificial intelligence (AI) model using randomly selected 4/5 of the dataset and use the rest data to validate the performance of the model. The result showed that the model achieved an AUC of 0.77 (fivefold cross-validation) on the training dataset and 0.80 on the testing dataset. To further confirm the performance of the presented model, we recruited 1,253 new T2DM patients as totally independent testing dataset including 200 and 1,053 ones with or without CHD. And the model achieved an AUC of 0.71. In addition, we implemented a model to quantitatively evaluate the risk contribution of each feature, which is thus able to present personalized guidance for specific individuals. Finally, an online web server for the model was built. This study presented an AI model to determine the risk of T2DM patients to develop to CHD, which has potential value in providing early warning personalized guidance of CHD risk for both T2DM patients and clinicians.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

In this paper, we investigated the impact of scanning systems (scanners) and cycle-GAN-based normalization on algorithm performance, by comparing different deep learning models to automatically detect prostate cancer in whole-slide images.

Models were developed on a multi-center cohort with 582 WSIs and subsequently evaluated on two independent test sets including 85 and 50 WSIs, respectively, to show the robustness of the proposed method to differing staining protocols and scanner types. We also investigated the application of normalization as a pre-processing step by two techniques, the whole-slide image color standardizer (WSICS) algorithm, and a cycle-GAN based method. For the two independent datasets we obtained an AUC of 0.92 and 0.83 respectively. After rescanning the AUC improves to 0.91/0.88 and after style normalization to 0.98/0.97.

"Population-scale longitudinal mapping of COVID-19 symptoms, behaviour and testing",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-00944-2,26 Aug 2020,"Despite the widespread implementation of public health measures, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to spread in the United States. To facilitate an agile response to the pandemic, we developed How We Feel, a web and mobile application that collects longitudinal self-reported survey responses on health, behaviour and demographics. Here, we report results from over 500,000 users in the United States from 2 April 2020 to 12 May 2020. We show that self-reported surveys can be used to build predictive models to identify likely COVID-19-positive individuals. We find evidence among our users for asymptomatic or presymptomatic presentation; show a variety of exposure, occupational and demographic risk factors for COVID-19 beyond symptoms; reveal factors for which users have been SARS-CoV-2 PCR tested; and highlight the temporal dynamics of symptoms and self-isolation behaviour. These results highlight the utility of collecting a diverse set of symptomatic, demographic, exposure and behavioural self-reported data to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Here we analyzed cardiovascular magnetic resonance images from a population-based study, the UK Biobank, using an automated machine-learning-based analysis pipeline. We report a comprehensive range of structural and functional phenotypes for the heart and aorta across 26,893 participants, and explore how these phenotypes vary according to sex, age and major cardiovascular risk factors. We extended this analysis with a phenome-wide association study, in which we tested for correlations of a wide range of non-imaging phenotypes of the participants with imaging phenotypes. We further explored the associations of imaging phenotypes with early-life factors, mental health and cognitive function using both observational analysis and Mendelian randomization. Our study illustrates how population-based cardiac and aortic imaging phenotypes can be used to better define cardiovascular disease risks as well as heart–brain health interactions, highlighting new opportunities for studying disease mechanisms and developing image-based biomarkers.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Development and validation of a sample entropy-based method to identify complex patient-ventilator interactions during mechanical ventilation,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-70814-4,17 Aug 2020,"Patient-ventilator asynchronies can be detected by close monitoring of ventilator screens by clinicians or through automated algorithms. However, detecting complex patient-ventilator interactions (CP-VI), consisting of changes in the respiratory rate and/or clusters of asynchronies, is a challenge. Sample Entropy (SE) of airway flow (SE-Flow) and airway pressure (SE-Paw) waveforms obtained from 27 critically ill patients was used to develop and validate an automated algorithm for detecting CP-VI. The algorithm’s performance was compared versus the gold standard (the ventilator’s waveform recordings for CP-VI were scored visually by three experts; Fleiss’ kappa = 0.90 (0.87–0.93)). A repeated holdout cross-validation procedure using the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) as a measure of effectiveness was used for optimization of different combinations of SE settings (embedding dimension, m, and tolerance value, r), derived SE features (mean and maximum values), and the thresholds of change (Th) from patient’s own baseline SE value. The most accurate results were obtained using the maximum values of SE-Flow (m = 2, r = 0.2, Th = 25%) and SE-Paw (m = 4, r = 0.2, Th = 30%) which report MCCs of 0.85 (0.78–0.86) and 0.78 (0.78–0.85), and accuracies of 0.93 (0.89–0.93) and 0.89 (0.89–0.93), respectively.

Effects of neonatal isoflurane anesthesia exposure on learning-specific and sensory systems in adults,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-70818-0,14 Aug 2020,"Millions of children undergo general anesthesia each year, and animal and human studies have indicated that exposure to anesthesia at an early age can impact neuronal development, leading to behavioral and learning impairments that manifest later in childhood and adolescence. Here, we examined the effects of isoflurane, a commonly-used general anesthetic, which was delivered to newborn rabbits. Trace eyeblink classical conditioning was used to assess the impact of neonatal anesthesia exposure on behavioral learning in adolescent subjects, and a variety of MRI techniques including fMRI, MR volumetry, spectroscopy and DTI captured functional, metabolic, and structural changes in key regions of the learning and sensory systems associated with anesthesia-induced learning impairment. Our results demonstrated a wide array of changes that were specific to anesthesia-exposed subjects, which supports previous studies that have pointed to a link between early anesthesia exposure and the development of learning and behavioral deficiencies.

Variability and reproducibility in deep learning for medical image segmentation,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-69920-0,13 Aug 2020,"Medical image segmentation is an important tool for current clinical applications. It is the backbone of numerous clinical diagnosis methods, oncological treatments and computer-integrated surgeries. A new class of machine learning algorithm, deep learning algorithms, outperforms the results of classical segmentation in terms of accuracy. However, these techniques are complex and can have a high range of variability, calling the reproducibility of the results into question. In this article, through a literature review, we propose an original overview of the sources of variability to better understand the challenges and issues of reproducibility related to deep learning for medical image segmentation. Finally, we propose 3 main recommendations to address these potential issues: (1) an adequate description of the framework of deep learning, (2) a suitable analysis of the different sources of variability in the framework of deep learning, and (3) an efficient system for evaluating the segmentation results.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Spatial regression analysis of MR diffusion reveals subject-specific white matter changes associated with repetitive head impacts in contact sports,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-70604-y,12 Aug 2020,"Repetitive head impacts (RHI) are a growing concern due to their possible neurocognitive effects, with research showing a season of RHI produce white matter (WM) changes seen on neuroimaging. We conducted a secondary analysis of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data for 28 contact athletes to compare WM changes. We collected pre-season and post-season DTI scans for each subject, approximately 3 months apart. We collected helmet data for the athletes, which we correlated with DTI data. We adapted the SPatial REgression Analysis of DTI (SPREAD) algorithm to conduct subject-specific longitudinal DTI analysis, and developed global inferential tools using functional norms and a novel robust p value combination test. At the individual level, most detected injured regions (93.3%) were associated with decreased FA values. Using meta-analysis techniques to combine injured regions across subjects, we found the combined injured region at the group level occupied the entire WM skeleton, suggesting the WM damage location is subject-specific. Several subject-specific functional summaries of SPREAD-detected WM change, e.g., the \({L}^{\infty }\) norm, significantly correlated with helmet impact measures, e.g. cumulative unweighted rotational acceleration (adjusted p = 0.0049), time between hits rotational acceleration (adjusted p value 0.0101), and time until DTI rotational acceleration (adjusted p = 0.0084), suggesting RHIs lead to WM changes.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Personal identification with orthopantomography using simple convolutional neural networks: a preliminary study,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-70474-4,11 Aug 2020,"Forensic dental examination has played an important role in personal identification (PI). However, PI has essentially been based on traditional visual comparisons of ante- and postmortem dental records and radiographs, and there is no globally accepted PI method based on digital technology. Although many effective image recognition models have been developed, they have been underutilized in forensic odontology. The aim of this study was to verify the usefulness of PI with paired orthopantomographs obtained in a relatively short period using convolutional neural network (CNN) technologies. Thirty pairs of orthopantomographs obtained on different days were analyzed in terms of the accuracy of dental PI based on six well-known CNN architectures: VGG16, ResNet50, Inception-v3, InceptionResNet-v2, Xception, and MobileNet-v2. Each model was trained and tested using paired orthopantomographs, and pretraining and fine-tuning transfer learning methods were validated. Higher validation accuracy was achieved with fine-tuning than with pretraining, and each architecture showed a detection accuracy of 80.0% or more. The VGG16 model achieved the highest accuracy (100.0%) with pretraining and with fine-tuning. This study demonstrated the usefulness of CNN for PI using small numbers of orthopantomographic images, and it also showed that VGG16 was the most useful of the six tested CNN architectures.",Conclusions not available,DNN,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
On the correlation between second order texture features and human observer detection performance in digital images,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-69816-z,11 Aug 2020,"Image texture, the relative spatial arrangement of intensity values in an image, encodes valuable information about the scene. As it stands, much of this potential information remains untapped. Understanding how to decipher textural details would afford another method of extracting knowledge of the physical world from images. In this work, we attempt to bridge the gap in research between quantitative texture analysis and the visual perception of textures. The impact of changes in image texture on human observer’s ability to perform signal detection and localization tasks in complex digital images is not understood. We examine this critical question by studying task-based human observer performance in detecting and localizing signals in tomographic breast images. We have also investigated how these changes impact the formation of second-order image texture. We used digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) an FDA approved tomographic X-ray breast imaging method as the modality of choice to show our preliminary results. Our human observer studies involve localization ROC (LROC) studies for low contrast mass detection in DBT. Simulated images are used as they offer the benefit of known ground truth. Our results prove that changes in system geometry or processing leads to changes in image texture magnitudes. We show that the variations in several well-known texture features estimated in digital images correlate with human observer detection–localization performance for signals embedded in them. This insight can allow efficient and practical techniques to identify the best imaging system design and algorithms or filtering tools by examining the changes in these texture features. This concept linking texture feature estimates and task based image quality assessment can be extended to several other imaging modalities and applications as well. It can also offer feedback in system and algorithm designs with a goal to improve perceptual benefits. Broader impact can be in wide array of areas including imaging system design, image processing, data science, machine learning, computer vision, perceptual and vision science. Our results also point to the caution that must be exercised in using these texture features as image-based radiomic features or as predictive markers for risk assessment as they are sensitive to system or image processing changes.","With simulated but realistic digital tomographic breast images, we have shown that image texture features are sensitive to a number of system design and processing parameters. Here processing could be pre or post reconstruction filters as well as different image reconstruction methods. Thus the variations in these texture features often called ’radiomic features’ in medical imaging, is not a function of object inhomogeneity and structure (or genetic signatures manifested in the image). These features are more sensitive to image noise resulting from system geometry, reconstruction and image processing algorithms (all are vendor dependent). Thus using image texture as radiomic features must be done with extreme caution.A more important result in this paper is the identification that variations in several well known texture features estimated in digital images correlate with human observer detection-localization performance for signals embedded in them. Extensive literature in vision science has associated several texture features with human’s ability to discriminate between images. However, to date there has been no work that points to their impact on ability to detect and localize signals in digital images. This understanding is of key significance in several areas including medical imaging and radiology where humans (or sometimes machines) search for signals/targets whose average properties may be known. It can also be of significance in images generated for defense and security applications. We illustrated that several easily computable image texture features can give insight into how the noise properties generated by system design/algorithms may impact detection-localization benefits in these images. Image processing and system changes (like detector blurring or changes in sampling) changes the magnitude of correlated noise within the image which influences the human observer’s ability to detect signals embedded in them. We examined if several readily computable texture features respond to these changes.Our results confirm that several texture features that fall under the three well known texture metrics GLCM, NGTDM and RLM show high correlation with task-based signal detection performance in DBT images by human observers. Our preliminary investigations show that several other texture features (not reported here) from all three metrics (GLCM, NGTDM and RLM) also show high correlation to human observer studies. Our goal was to present a few popular features widely seen in vision science literature. We have highlighted some features that show high and robust correlation. These correlations stay significant against change in image noise due to geometry or processing algorithms—showing the potential utility of these methods to be used as surrogates for finding trends in task based performance assessments in medical imaging. These texture features can give reliable trends in task-based image quality that often requires tools like mathematical model observers which are computationally intensive or difficult to apply directly to clinical images. This points to the high significance of the results presented in this paper. Our findings have the potential to open new avenues in the development of practical task based assessment tools where reliable, qualitative trends would be deemed sufficient to compare imaging geometries and algorithms.Since our work relies on simulated realistic images with signal locations known to the experimenter (but unknown to the observer), we were able to correlate the localization and detection benefits simultaneously when the observer makes decision on a given test image for signal presence. Our results show concrete evidence of the correlation of some second order texture features to human visual perception. These high correlations remain robust for varying system configurations and noise levels. While the current study tested detection of low contrast masses, these same texture features might not show high correlation for other signal types like small microcalcifications (high frequency signals). These questions are part of our ongoing investigations. The insights offered in this work could allow fast algorithmic approaches to examining detection benefits of a newly designed clinical system or algorithm. It can also offer feedback in system and algorithm designs with a goal to improve perceptual benefits27. Besides understanding perception in medical images, our results could benefit multiple areas such as artificial intelligence, machine learning and computer vision. In all these domains, significant benefits including transparency and simplicity can be achieved by considering the physics of image formation and basic image science concepts53.",DNN,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Using 554 temporal-spatial features of the 12-lead ECG, we train and test multiple classifiers on two independent prospective patient cohorts (n = 1244). While maintaining higher negative predictive value, our final fusion model achieves 52% gain in sensitivity compared to commercial interpretation software and 37% gain in sensitivity compared to experienced clinicians.

Phenomic profiling of compound libraries can be used for compound target identification or mechanism of action (MoA) prediction and other applications in drug discovery. To devise an economical set of phenomic profiling assays, we assembled a library of 1,008 approved drugs and well-characterized tool compounds manually annotated to 218 unique MoAs, and we profiled each compound at four concentrations in live-cell, high-content imaging screens against a panel of 15 reporter cell lines, which expressed a diverse set of fluorescent organelle and pathway markers in three distinct cell lineages. For 41 of 83 testable MoAs, phenomic profiles accurately ranked the reference compounds (AUC-ROC ≥ 0.9). MoAs could be better resolved by screening compounds at multiple concentrations than by including replicates at a single concentration. Screening additional cell lineages and fluorescent markers increased the number of distinguishable MoAs but this effect quickly plateaued. There remains a substantial number of MoAs that were hard to distinguish from others under the current study’s conditions. We discuss ways to close this gap, which will inform the design of future phenomic profiling efforts.",Conclusions not available,Gen AI,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: ; Attacker Capability: 
Defining and predicting transdiagnostic categories of neurodegenerative disease,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-020-0593-y,03 Aug 2020,"The prevalence of concomitant proteinopathies and heterogeneous clinical symptoms in neurodegenerative diseases hinders the identification of individuals who might be candidates for a particular intervention. Here, by applying an unsupervised clustering algorithm to post-mortem histopathological data from 895 patients with degeneration in the central nervous system, we show that six non-overlapping disease clusters can simultaneously account for tau neurofibrillary tangles, α-synuclein inclusions, neuritic plaques, inclusions of the transcriptional repressor TDP-43, angiopathy, neuron loss and gliosis. We also show that membership to the six transdiagnostic disease clusters, which explains more variance in cognitive phenotypes than can be explained by individual diagnoses, can be accurately predicted from scores of the Mini-Mental Status Exam, protein levels in cerebrospinal fluid, and genotype at the APOE and MAPT loci, via cross-validated multiple logistic regression.

Inferring disease subtypes from clusters in explanation space,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-68858-7,30 Jul 2020,"Identification of disease subtypes and corresponding biomarkers can substantially improve clinical diagnosis and treatment selection. Discovering these subtypes in noisy, high dimensional biomedical data is often impossible for humans and challenging for machines. We introduce a new approach to facilitate the discovery of disease subtypes: Instead of analyzing the original data, we train a diagnostic classifier (healthy vs. diseased) and extract instance-wise explanations for the classifier’s decisions. The distribution of instances in the explanation space of our diagnostic classifier amplifies the different reasons for belonging to the same class–resulting in a representation that is uniquely useful for discovering latent subtypes. We compare our ability to recover subtypes via cluster analysis on model explanations to classical cluster analysis on the original data. In multiple datasets with known ground-truth subclasses, particularly on UK Biobank brain imaging data and transcriptome data from the Cancer Genome Atlas, we show that cluster analysis on model explanations substantially outperforms the classical approach. While we believe clustering in explanation space to be particularly valuable for inferring disease subtypes, the method is more general and applicable to any kind of sub-type identification.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Distribution pattern of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and tumor microenvironment composition as prognostic indicators in anorectal malignant melanoma,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41379-020-0633-x,24 Jul 2020,"Anorectal malignant melanoma (ARMM) is a rare disease with poor prognosis. Determining ARMM prognosis precisely is difficult due to the lack of proper assessment techniques. Immunotherapy has proven effective against cutaneous malignant melanoma and may show efficacy in ARMM. Herein, we assessed the immune profile of ARMM to identify possible prognostic biomarkers. Twenty-two ARMM formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded samples were evaluated using an nCounter® PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel. Validation was performed through immunohistochemical staining for CD3, CD8, Foxp3, CD68, CD163, and PD-L1. RNA analysis revealed significantly decreased scores for pathways involved in cell regulation and function, as well as chemokines, in recurrent patients compared to nonrecurrent patients. In cell-type profiling, the recurrent cases displayed significantly low tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) scores. Recurrence/death prediction models were defined using logistic regression and showed significantly lower scores in recurrent and deceased patients (all, P < 0.001) compared to those in nonrecurrent and surviving patients. The high total TIL and tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) groups had significantly better overall survival outcomes compared to the low total TIL and TAM groups (P = 0.007 and P = 0.035, respectively). In addition, the presence of CD3 + TILs in the invasion front was an independent favorable prognostic indicator (P = 0.003, hazard ratio = 0.21, 95% confidential interval, 0.01–0.41). Patients with inflamed or brisk-infiltration type tumors also had a significantly better overall survival than that of patients with immune-desert/excluded and absent/non-brisk type tumors (P = 0.03 and P = 0.0023, respectively). In conclusion, TILs have a strong prognostic value in ARMM, and the quantification of TILs and an analysis of the TIL phenotype and infiltration pattern during pathological diagnosis are essential to guide treatment strategies and accurate prognosis in ARMM.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: evasion; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Using an ontology of the human cardiovascular system to improve the classification of histological images,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-69037-4,23 Jul 2020,"The advantages of automatically recognition of fundamental tissues using computer vision techniques are well known, but one of its main limitations is that sometimes it is not possible to classify correctly an image because the visual information is insufficient or the descriptors extracted are not discriminative enough. An Ontology could solve in part this problem, because it gathers and makes possible to use the specific knowledge that allows detecting clear mistakes in the classification, occasionally simply by pointing out impossible configurations in that domain. One of the main contributions of this work is that we used a Histological Ontology to correct, and therefore improve the classification of histological images. First, we described small regions of images, denoted as blocks, using Local Binary Pattern (LBP) based descriptors and we determined which tissue of the cardiovascular system was present using a cascade Support Vector Machine (SVM). Later, we built Resource Description Framework (RDF) triples for the occurrences of each discriminant class. Based on that, we used a Histological Ontology to correct, among others, “not possible” situations, improving in this way the global accuracy in the blocks first and in tissues classification later. For the experimental validation, we used a set of 6000 blocks of \(100\times100\) pixels, obtaining F-Scores between 0.769 and 0.886. Thus, there is an improvement between 0.003 and \(0.769\%\) when compared to the approach without the histological ontology. The methodology improves the automatic classification of histological images using a histological ontology. Another advantage of our proposal is that using the Ontology, we were capable of recognising the epithelial tissue, previously not detected by any of the computer vision methods used, including a CNN proposal called HistoResNet evaluated in the experiments. Finally, we also have created and made publicly available a dataset consisting of 6000 blocks of labelled histological tissues.","In this paper, we presented a process that improves the classification of the healthy fundamental tissues and organs, obtained by computer vision techniques, by using the knowledge contained in a histological ontology. Our method enables to obtain more consistent information and to reduce the error and uncertainty through corroboration and verification, by comparing every analysis of the different data sources separately.We have improved the initial classification based on computer vision, by using the knowledge contained in a histological ontology. With the proposed method, between 0.769 and 0.886 F-Score were obtained. Additionally, the improved process increases F-Score of the initial classification between 0.003% and \(0.769\%\) according to the histological image and its automatic classification. The results revealed that the proposed method increases F-Score in all cases.We compared our methodology with a CNN proposal called HistoResNet and an ensemble of classifiers in a late-fusion fashion (HistoResNet, HistoVGG16, HistoVGG19, and HistoInception) obtaining similar results in most of the classes except for the epithelial tissue, where our proposal demonstrates its superiority because it is capable of recognising this tissue whiles the CNN and the ensemble classifier are not.Additionally, we have introduced a new method to recognise the epithelial tissue based on the histological ontology classification. We have concluded that the improved classification using a histological ontology enables us to identify the epithelial tissue in images with \(10\times\) magnification whereas images with \(40\times\) magnification are not always available to recognise areas of epithelial tissue.Besides, the use of an Ontology, comparing with the use of taxonomies6, allows to obtain and infer more information of histological knowledge such as a system, a composition, but also as structures, relations, regions, layers, sectors, tissues and cells.The ontology-based classification includes histology information additional to texture features from image classification. This improve results and make the method more robust and complete. However, this proposal is limit to texture features in this stage. Additionally, as another contribution, we have created and made publicly available a dataset consisting of 6000 blocks that can be used to validate the results obtained in our work.In the future, we will extend this proposal by working in the following two lines: (i) exploring our ontology-based methodology using CNN strategies instead of SVM; (ii) exploring an adaptive block size to reduce the misclassification in edges areas; (iii) in this work, we compared our proposal against ensembles of CNNs. We used majority and weight voting. We plan to consider other ensembles strategies. (iii) including global features, spatial and relational features, on the classification performance to include more discriminant information among classes. (iv) to use macro-circulation identification to recognise micro-circulation organs; and (v) to apply the ontology-based classification process to different problems in medicine and industry. A re-definition of ontological rules to the specific context are needed considering knowledge information depends on the application domain or particular subject area.","Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: ; Attacker Capability:

Due to its complex multifactorial nature, prediction is a challenge. Current research is aiming to develop accurate predictive models using patient history, ultrasound and biochemical markers. Volatile organic compound (VOC) analysis is an approach, which has good diagnostic potential to predict many disease states. Analysis of VOCs can reflect both the microbiome and host response to a condition. We aimed to ascertain if VOC analysis of vaginal swabs, taken throughout pregnancy, could predict which women go on to deliver preterm. Our prospective observational cohort study demonstrates that VOC analysis of vaginal swabs, taken in the midtrimester, is a fair test (AUC 0.79) for preterm prediction, with a sensitivity of 0.66 (95%CI 0.56–0.75) and specificity 0.89 (95%CI 0.82–0.94). Using vaginal swabs taken closest to delivery, VOC analysis is a good test (AUC 0.84) for the prediction of preterm birth with a sensitivity of 0.73 (95%CI 0.64–0.81) and specificity of 0.90 (95%CI 0.82–0.95).

Robust performance of deep learning for distinguishing glioblastoma from single brain metastasis using radiomic features: model development and validation,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-68980-6,21 Jul 2020,"We evaluated the diagnostic performance and generalizability of traditional machine learning and deep learning models for distinguishing glioblastoma from single brain metastasis using radiomics. The training and external validation cohorts comprised 166 (109 glioblastomas and 57 metastases) and 82 (50 glioblastomas and 32 metastases) patients, respectively. Two-hundred-and-sixty-five radiomic features were extracted from semiautomatically segmented regions on contrast-enhancing and peritumoral T2 hyperintense masks and used as input data.

Considering that the etiology of complex diseases like AD could depend on functional multiple genes interaction network, here we proposed an alternative GWAS analysis strategy based on (i) multivariate methods and on a (ii) telescope approach, in order to guarantee the identification of correlated variables, and reveal their connections at three biological connected levels. Specifically as multivariate methods, we employed two machine learning algorithms and a genetic association test and we considered SNPs, Genes and Pathways features in the analysis of two public GWAS dataset (ADNI-1 and ADNI-2). For each dataset and for each feature we addressed two binary classifications tasks: cases vs. controls and the low vs. high risk of developing AD considering the allelic status of APOEe4. This complex strategy allowed the identification of SNPs, genes and pathways lists statistically robust and meaningful from the biological viewpoint. Among the results, we confirm the involvement of TOMM40 gene in AD and we propose GRM7 as a novel gene significantly associated with AD.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Simultaneous FDG-PET/MRI detects hippocampal subfield metabolic differences in AD/MCI,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-69065-0,21 Jul 2020,"The medial temporal lobe is one of the most well-studied brain regions affected by Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Although the spread of neurofibrillary pathology in the hippocampus throughout the progression of AD has been thoroughly characterized and staged using histology and other imaging techniques, it has not been precisely quantified in vivo at the subfield level using simultaneous positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Here, we investigate alterations in metabolism and volume using [18F]fluoro-deoxyglucose (FDG) and simultaneous time-of-flight (TOF) PET/MRI with hippocampal subfield analysis of AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and healthy subjects. We found significant structural and metabolic changes within the hippocampus that can be sensitively assessed at the subfield level in a small cohort. While no significant differences were found between groups for whole hippocampal SUVr values (p = 0.166), we found a clear delineation in SUVr between groups in the dentate gyrus (p = 0.009). Subfield analysis may be more sensitive for detecting pathological changes using PET-MRI in AD compared to global hippocampal assessment.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
High-resolution and differential analysis of rat microglial markers in traumatic brain injury: conventional flow cytometric and bioinformatics analysis,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-68770-0,20 Jul 2020,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) results in a cascade of cellular responses, which produce neuroinflammation, partly due to microglial activation. Transforming from surveying to primed phenotypes, microglia undergo considerable molecular changes. However, specific microglial profiles in rat remain elusive due to tedious methodology and limited availability of reagents. Here, we present a flow cytometry-based analysis of rat microglia 24 h after TBI using the controlled cortical impact model, validated with a bioinformatics approach. Isolated microglia are analyzed for morphological changes and their expression of activation markers using flow cytometry, traditional gating-based analysis methods and support the data by employing bioinformatics statistical tools. We use CD45, CD11b/c, and p2y12 receptor to identify microglia and evaluate their activation state using CD32, CD86, RT1B, CD200R, and CD163. The results from logic-gated flow cytometry analysis was validated with bioinformatics-based analysis and machine learning algorithms to detect quantitative changes in morphology and marker expression in microglia due to activation following TBI.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Altered proximal tubular cell glucose metabolism during acute kidney injury is associated with mortality,https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-020-0238-1,20 Jul 2020,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is strongly associated with mortality, independently of its cause. The kidney contributes to up to 40% of systemic glucose production by gluconeogenesis during fasting and under stress conditions. Whether kidney gluconeogenesis is impaired during AKI and how this might influence systemic metabolism remain unknown. Here we show that glucose production and lactate clearance are impaired during human and experimental AKI by using renal arteriovenous catheterization in patients, lactate tolerance testing in mice and glucose isotope labelling in rats. Single-cell transcriptomics reveal that gluconeogenesis is impaired in proximal tubule cells during AKI. In a retrospective cohort of critically ill patients, we demonstrate that altered glucose metabolism during AKI is a major determinant of systemic glucose and lactate levels and is strongly associated with mortality. Thiamine supplementation increases lactate clearance without modifying renal function in mice with AKI, enhances glucose production by renal tubular cells ex vivo and is associated with reduced mortality and improvement of the metabolic pattern in a retrospective cohort of critically ill patients with AKI. This study highlights an unappreciated systemic role of renal glucose and lactate metabolism under stress conditions, delineates general mechanisms of AKI-associated mortality and introduces a potential intervention targeting metabolism for a highly prevalent clinical condition with limited therapeutic options.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

To recreate a human kidney, mimicry of the elastic properties of the human kidney is crucial. However, none of the related work addressed the design and development of a kidney phantom using only silicone as material. In contrast to paraffin and hydrogel, silicone is an ideal variant for its extended shelf life, soft-tissue-like feeling, and viscoelastic modularity. To this end, we conducted Uniaxial Compression testing and Cauchy stress modeling. Results indicate that none of the available manufacturer silicone brands are suitable for the task of creating a realistic kidney phantom. Indeed, the tested silicone mixtures in low and high strain fall outside the required approximate target compressive moduli of 20 kPa and 500 kPa, respectively. This work provides a frame of reference for future work by avoiding the pitfalls of the selected ready-made silicones and reusing the reported theoretical and experimental setup to design a realistic replica of the kidney organ.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

While the promise of machine learning has been explored in a variety of scientific disciplines, its application in creation of a framework for computationally expensive transient models has not been fully explored. Here, we present an ensemble approach where one such computationally expensive tool, discrete element method, is combined with time-series forecasting via auto regressive integrated moving average and machine learning methods to simulate a complex pharmaceutical problem: development of an agitation protocol in an agitated filter dryer to ensure uniform solid bed mixing. This ensemble approach leads to a significant reduction in the computational burden, while retaining model accuracy and performance, practically rendering simulations possible.

Deep-learning-based accurate hepatic steatosis quantification for histological assessment of liver biopsies,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41374-020-0463-y,13 Jul 2020,"Hepatic steatosis droplet quantification with histology biopsies has high clinical significance for risk stratification and management of patients with fatty liver diseases and in the decision to use donor livers for transplantation. However, pathology reviewing processes, when conducted manually, are subject to a high inter- and intra-reader variability, due to the overwhelmingly large number and significantly varying appearance of steatosis instances. This process is challenging as there is a large number of overlapped steatosis droplets with either missing or weak boundaries. In this study, we propose a deep-learning-based region-boundary integrated network for precise steatosis quantification with whole slide liver histopathology images. The proposed model consists of two sequential steps: a region extraction and a boundary prediction module for foreground regions and steatosis boundary prediction, followed by an integrated prediction map generation. Missing steatosis boundaries are next recovered from the predicted map and assembled from adjacent image patches to generate results for the whole slide histopathology image. The resulting steatosis measures both at the pixel level and steatosis object-level present strong correlation with pathologist annotations, radiology readouts and clinical data. In addition, the segregated steatosis object count is shown as a promising alternative measure to the traditional metrics at the pixel level. These results suggest a high potential of artificial intelligence-assisted technology to enhance liver disease decision support using whole slide images.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Generalizable deep temporal models for predicting episodes of sudden hypotension in critically ill patients: a personalized approach,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-67952-0,10 Jul 2020,"The vast quantities of data generated and collected in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) have given rise to large retrospective datasets that are frequently used for observational studies. The temporal nature and fine granularity of much of the data collected in the ICU enable the pursuit of predictive modeling. In particular, forecasting acute hypotensive episodes (AHE) in intensive care patients has been of interest to researchers in critical care medicine. Given an advance warning of an AHE, care providers may be prompted to search for evolving disease processes and help mitigate negative clinical outcomes. However, the conventionally adopted definition of an AHE does not account for inter-patient variability and is restrictive. To reflect the wider trend of global clinical and research efforts in precision medicine, we introduce a patient-specific definition of AHE in this study and propose deep learning based models to predict this novel definition of AHE in data from multiple independent institutions. We provide extensive evaluation of the models by studying their accuracies in detecting patient-specific AHEs with lead-times ranging from 10 min to 1 hour before the onset of the event. The resulting models achieve AUROC values ranging from 0.57–0.87 depending on the lead time of the prediction. We demonstrate the generalizability and robustness of our approach through the use of independent multi-institutional data.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Electrocardiographic changes predate Parkinson’s disease onset,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-68241-6,09 Jul 2020,"Autonomic nervous system involvement precedes the motor features of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Our goal was to develop a proof-of-concept model for identifying subjects at high risk of developing PD by analysis of cardiac electrical activity. We used standard 10-s electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings of 60 subjects from the Honolulu Asia Aging Study including 10 with prevalent PD, 25 with prodromal PD, and 25 controls who never developed PD. Various methods were implemented to extract features from ECGs including simple heart rate variability (HRV) metrics, commonly used signal processing methods, and a Probabilistic Symbolic Pattern Recognition (PSPR) method. Extracted features were analyzed via stepwise logistic regression to distinguish between prodromal cases and controls. Stepwise logistic regression selected four features from PSPR as predictors of PD. The final regression model built on the entire dataset provided an area under receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) with 95% confidence interval of 0.90 [0.80, 0.99]. The five-fold cross-validation process produced an average AUC of 0.835 [0.831, 0.839]. We conclude that cardiac electrical activity provides important information about the likelihood of future PD not captured by classical HRV metrics. Machine learning applied to ECGs may help identify subjects at high risk of having prodromal PD.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Wireless monitoring and real-time adaptive predictive indicator of deterioration,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-67835-4,09 Jul 2020,"To assist in the early warning of deterioration in hospitalised children we studied the feasibility of collecting continuous wireless physiological data using Lifetouch (ECG-derived heart and respiratory rate) and WristOx2 (pulse-oximetry and derived pulse rate) sensors. We compared our bedside paediatric early warning (PEW) score and a machine learning automated approach: a Real-time Adaptive Predictive Indicator of Deterioration (RAPID) to identify children experiencing significant clinical deterioration. 982 patients contributed 7,073,486 min during 1,263 monitoring sessions. The proportion of intended monitoring time was 93% for Lifetouch and 55% for WristOx2. Valid clinical data was 63% of intended monitoring time for Lifetouch and 50% WristOx2. 29 patients experienced 36 clinically significant deteriorations. The RAPID Index detected significant deterioration more frequently (77% to 97%) and earlier than the PEW score ≥ 9/26. High sensitivity and negative predictive value for the RAPID Index was associated with low specificity and low positive predictive value. We conclude that it is feasible to collect clinically valid physiological data wirelessly for 50% of intended monitoring time. The RAPID Index identified more deterioration, before the PEW score, but has a low specificity. By using the RAPID Index with a PEW system some life-threatening events may be averted.",Wireless monitoring in children can collect clinically valid data for more than 50% of intended monitoring time. An improved pulse oximeter sensor is required to improve data capture. We have shown it is feasible to develop and display a smart alarm in real-time. The RAPID Index can detect the majority of significant deteriorations before the current early warning system but has a low specificity and is currently associated with false alarms. The RAPID Index and PEW score are effective at ruling out the likelihood of significant deterioration. Further improvements in data quality will hopefully improve the precision. By using the RAPID Index in addition to PEW system it is possible that some life-threatening events may be averted. This data is very preliminary and the technology needs further efficacy and health economic evaluation prior to adoption.,Gen AI,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Moreover, the influence of lifestyle has been separated from genetic and geographic factors by studies of genetically similar populations and ethnically distinct groups living in the same geographic location7,8,9,10,11. The lifestyle of Irish Travellers, an ethnically distinct subpopulation, changed with legislation in 2002 that effectively ended nomadism and altered their living conditions. Comparative metagenomics of gut microbiomes shows that Irish Travellers retain a microbiota similar to that of non-industrialized societies.

In a 17-center prospective study of infants (aged < 1 year) hospitalized for bronchiolitis, by using routinely-available pre-hospitalization data as predictors, we developed four machine learning models: Lasso regression, elastic net regression, random forest, and gradient boosted decision tree. We compared their predictive performance—e.g., area-under-the-curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and net benefit (decision curves)—using a cross-validation method, with that of the reference model. The outcomes were positive pressure ventilation use and intensive treatment (admission to intensive care unit and/or positive pressure ventilation use). Of 1,016 infants, 5.4% underwent positive pressure ventilation and 16.0% had intensive treatment. For the positive pressure ventilation outcome, machine learning models outperformed reference model (e.g., AUC 0.88 [95% CI 0.84–0.93] in gradient boosted decision tree vs 0.62 [95% CI 0.53–0.70] in reference model), with higher sensitivity (0.89 [95% CI 0.80–0.96] vs. 0.62 [95% CI 0.49–0.75]) and specificity (0.77 [95% CI 0.75–0.80] vs. 0.57 [95% CI 0.54–0.60]).

An artificial neural network approach for predicting hypertension using NHANES data,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-67640-z,30 Jun 2020,"This paper focus on a neural network classification model to estimate the association among gender, race, BMI, age, smoking, kidney disease and diabetes in hypertensive patients. It also shows that artificial neural network techniques applied to large clinical data sets may provide a meaningful data-driven approach to categorize patients for population health management, and support in the control and detection of hypertensive patients, which is part of the critical factors for diseases of the heart. Data was obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2007 to 2016. This paper utilized an imbalanced data set of 24,434 with (69.71%) non-hypertensive patients, and (30.29%) hypertensive patients. The results indicate a sensitivity of 40%, a specificity of 87%, precision of 57.8% and a measured AUC of 0.77 (95% CI [75.01–79.01]). This paper showed results that are to some degree more effectively than a previous study performed by the authors using a statistical model with similar input features that presents a calculated AUC of 0.73. This classification model can be used as an inference agent to assist the professionals in diseases of the heart field, and can be implemented in applications to assist population health management programs in identifying patients with high risk of developing hypertension.","This paper presents a neural network approach to overthrown the non-linearity problem with the risk factors utilized as inputs for the model. This paper shows that the proposed model improves the accuracy and performance of a previous paper that used the same input features and the results were better than logistic regression in a small percentage. The main contribution of this paper is the developed model and based on results showed that ANN was the proper model compared with the previously developed LR model.Our multi-layer model confirmed the influence of the imbalanced data set to the class with more presence in the data. This paper showed that the proposed model could be a guide to the design of other models and inference engines for expert systems. This model cannot be used yet to provide the final diagnosis in developing hypertension in patients due that it requires clinician’s involvement for validation with real patients. However, this model can be used to make them aware that there is a probability that the patients could be developing hypertension.Knowledge of the current model, and their parameters on risk-prediction models in general, is constructive to determine how to best approach the build of prediction models for hypertension, design the study, and interpret its results. When there is a realistic chance to find an applicable positive effect on decision-making and patient outcome, this model on a new setting could be potentially useful. This paper outlines the process for the development of a neural network risk prediction model, from choosing a data source and selecting features to assess model performance, performing validation, and assessing the impact of the model outcomes.For future work, this model will be apply and re-train if necessary to a real balanced data set, and bigger network architectures will be considered. Also, new risk factors can be used to better handle the distribution and behavior of the input features for the model, and a sensitivity analysis will be performed to determine which inputs in our ANN model are significant with respect to the output. This paper will be the ground for the construction of a decision supporting tool that may be useful to healthcare practitioners for contributing to decision making about the risk of developing hypertension in typical or atypical patient screening circumstances.","Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI","Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient, healthcare practitioner; Attacker Capability: "

However, the final interpretation is essential to surgeons, who base their management on the final pathology report. Patients who receive a diagnosis of fibroadenoma might not undergo any additional intervention while lumpectomy with wide margins is the standard of care for phyllodes tumor, which can have significant cosmetic consequences. We studied the clinical, immunophenotypic, and proteomics profiles of 31 histologically confirmed low-grade phyllodes tumor and 30 fibroadenomas. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) and immunohistochemistry for Ki-67, p53, β-catenin, and E-cadherin were performed on all cases. After the mass spectra for all 31 cases of low-grade phyllodes tumor and 30 cases of fibroadenoma were collected, an average peak value for all cases was generated. There was no significant difference in the overall mass spectra pattern in any of the peaks identified. There was also overlap in the percentage of cells staining positive for Ki-67, p53, β-catenin, and E-cadherin. The two groups of patients showed no statistically significant difference in age, tumor size, or disease-free survival.

We here investigate the use of patient-generated health data and data-driven phenotyping to characterize endometriosis patient subtypes, based on their reported signs and symptoms. We aim at unsupervised learning of endometriosis phenotypes using self-tracking data from personal smartphones. We leverage data from an observational research study of over 4000 women with endometriosis that track their condition over more than 2 years. We extend a classical mixed-membership model to accommodate the idiosyncrasies of the data at hand, i.e., the multimodality and uncertainty of the self-tracked variables. The proposed method, by jointly modeling a wide range of observations (i.e., participant symptoms, quality of life, treatments), identifies clinically relevant endometriosis subtypes. Experiments show that our method is robust to different hyperparameter choices and the biases of self-tracking data (e.g., the wide variations in tracking frequency among participants). With this work, we show the promise of unsupervised learning of endometriosis subtypes from self-tracked data, as learned phenotypes align well with what is already known about the disease, but also suggest new clinically actionable findings. More generally, we argue that a continued research effort on unsupervised phenotyping methods with patient-generated health data via new mobile and digital technologies will have significant impact on the study of enigmatic diseases in particular, and health in general.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Metabolic activity in subcallosal cingulate predicts response to deep brain stimulation for depression,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41386-020-0745-5,24 Jun 2020,"Subcallosal cingulate (SCC) deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a promising therapy for treatment-resistant depression (TRD), but response rates in open-label studies were not replicated in a large multicenter trial. Identifying biomarkers of response could improve patient selection and outcomes. We examined SCC metabolic activity as both a predictor and marker of SCC DBS treatment response. Brain glucose metabolism (CMRGlu) was measured with [18F] FDG-PET at baseline and 6 months post DBS in 20 TRD patients in a double-blind randomized controlled trial where two stimulation types (long pulse width (LPW) n = 9 and short pulse width (SPW) n = 11) were used. Responders (n = 10) were defined by a ≥48% reduction in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores after 6 months. The response rates were similar with five responders in each stimulation group: LPW (55.6%) and SPW (44.5%). First, differences in SCC CMRGlu in responders and non-responders were compared at baseline. Then machine learning analysis was performed with a leave-one-out cross-validation using a Gaussian naive Bayes classifier to test whether baseline CMRGlu in SCC could categorize responders. Finally, we compared 6-month change in metabolic activity with change in depression severity. All analyses were controlled for age. Baseline SCC CMRGlu was significantly higher in responders than non-responders. The machine learning analysis predicted response with 80% accuracy.

Evaluation of deep convolutional neural networks for automatic classification of common maternal fetal ultrasound planes,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-67076-5,23 Jun 2020,"The goal of this study was to evaluate the maturity of current Deep Learning classification techniques for their application in a real maternal-fetal clinical environment. A large dataset of routinely acquired maternal-fetal screening ultrasound images (which will be made publicly available) was collected from two different hospitals by several operators and ultrasound machines. All images were manually labeled by an expert maternal fetal clinician. Images were divided into 6 classes: four of the most widely used fetal anatomical planes (Abdomen, Brain, Femur and Thorax), the mother’s cervix (widely used for prematurity screening) and a general category to include any other less common image plane. Fetal brain images were further categorized into the 3 most common fetal brain planes (Trans-thalamic, Trans-cerebellum, Trans-ventricular) to judge fine grain categorization performance. The final dataset is comprised of over 12,400 images from 1,792 patients, making it the largest ultrasound dataset to date. We then evaluated a wide variety of state-of-the-art deep Convolutional Neural Networks on this dataset and analyzed results in depth, comparing the computational models to research technicians, which are the ones currently performing the task daily. Results indicate for the first time that computational models have similar performance compared to humans when classifying common planes in human fetal examination. However, the dataset leaves the door open on future research to further improve results, especially on fine-grained plane categorization.","To conclude, for the first time computational models have been shown to be mature enough for its widespread application to real maternal-fetal clinical settings, especially as support in general US recognition. However, several concerns remain about its transferability and application to fine-grained categorization, without which modern clinical diagnosis would not be possible. We hope this study and our maternal-fetal US dataset will serve as a catalyzer for future research.","DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Gut Microbiota Profiles of Treated Metabolic Syndrome Patients and their Relationship with Metabolic Health,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-67078-3,22 Jun 2020,"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) has become a worldwide health issue. Recent studies reveal that the human gut microbiota exerts a significant role in the pathogenesis of this disease. While drug treatments may greatly improve metabolic symptoms, little is known about the gut microbiota composition of these treated MetS patients. This study aimed to characterize the gut microbiota composition of treated-MetS patients and analyse the possibility of using gut microbiota as an indicator of metabolic conditions. 16S rRNA metagenomic sequencing approach was used to profile gut microbiota of 111 treated MetS patients from The Cohort of patients at a high Risk of Cardiovascular Events (CORE)-Thailand registry. Our results show that the gut microbiota profiles of MetS patients are diverse across individuals, but can be classified based on their similarity into three groups or enterotypes. We also showed several associations between species abundance and metabolic parameters that are enterotype specific. These findings suggest that information on the gut microbiota can be useful for assessing treatment options for MetS patients. In addition, any correlations between species abundance and human properties are likely specific to each microbial community.",Conclusions not available,Gen AI,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Serum adipokines/related inflammatory factors and ratios as predictors of infrapatellar fat pad volume in osteoarthritis: Applying comprehensive machine learning approaches,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-66330-0,19 Jun 2020,"Objective. The infrapatellar fat pad (IPFP) has been associated with knee osteoarthritis onset and progression. This study uses machine learning (ML) approaches to predict serum levels of some adipokines/related inflammatory factors and their ratios on knee IPFP volume of osteoarthritis patients.Methods. Serum and MRI were from the OAI at baseline. Variables comprised the 3 main osteoarthritis risk factors (age, gender, BMI), 6 adipokines, 3 inflammatory factors, and their 36 ratios. IPFP volume was assessed on MRI with a ML methodology. The best variables and models were identified in Total-cohort (n = 678), High-BMI (n = 341) and Low-BMI (n = 337), using a selection approach based on ML methods. Results. The best model for each group included three risk factors and adipsin/C-reactive protein combined for Total-cohort, adipsin/chemerin; High-BMI, chemerin/adiponectin HMW; and Low-BMI, interleukin-8. Gender separation improved the prediction (13–16%) compared to the BMI-based models. Reproducibility with osteoarthritis patients from a clinical trial was excellent (R: female 0.83, male 0.95). Pseudocodes based on gender were generated.Conclusion. This study demonstrates for the first time that the combination of the serum levels of adipokines/inflammatory factors and the three main risk factors of osteoarthritis could predict IPFP volume with high reproducibility, with the superior performance of the model accounting for gender separation.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
"BAGLS, a multihospital Benchmark for Automatic Glottis Segmentation",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-0526-3,19 Jun 2020,"Laryngeal videoendoscopy is one of the main tools in clinical examinations for voice disorders and voice research. Using high-speed videoendoscopy, it is possible to fully capture the vocal fold oscillations, however, processing the recordings typically involves a time-consuming segmentation of the glottal area by trained experts. Even though automatic methods have been proposed and the task is particularly suited for deep learning methods, there are no public datasets and benchmarks available to compare methods and to allow training of generalizing deep learning models. In an international collaboration of researchers from seven institutions from the EU and USA, we have created BAGLS, a large, multihospital dataset of 59,250 high-speed videoendoscopy frames with individually annotated segmentation masks. The frames are based on 640 recordings of healthy and disordered subjects that were recorded with varying technical equipment by numerous clinicians. The BAGLS dataset will allow an objective comparison of glottis segmentation methods and will enable interested researchers to train their own models and compare their methods.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Histologic tissue components provide major cues for machine learning-based prostate cancer detection and grading on prostatectomy specimens,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-66849-2,18 Jun 2020,"Automatically detecting and grading cancerous regions on radical prostatectomy (RP) sections facilitates graphical and quantitative pathology reporting, potentially benefitting post-surgery prognosis, recurrence prediction, and treatment planning after RP. Promising results for detecting and grading prostate cancer on digital histopathology images have been reported using machine learning techniques. However, the importance and applicability of those methods have not been fully investigated. We computed three-class tissue component maps (TCMs) from the images, where each pixel was labeled as nuclei, lumina, or other. We applied seven different machine learning approaches: three non-deep learning classifiers with features extracted from TCMs, and four deep learning, using transfer learning with the 1) TCMs, 2) nuclei maps, 3) lumina maps, and 4) raw images for cancer detection and grading on whole-mount RP tissue sections. We performed leave-one-patient-out cross-validation against expert annotations using 286 whole-slide images from 68 patients. For both cancer detection and grading, transfer learning using TCMs performed best. Transfer learning using nuclei maps yielded slightly inferior overall performance, but the best performance for classifying higher-grade cancer. This suggests that 3-class TCMs provide the major cues for cancer detection and grading primarily using nucleus features, which are the most important information for identifying higher-grade cancer.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
A Metabolomics Approach for Early Prediction of Vincristine-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-66815-y,15 Jun 2020,"Vincristine is a core chemotherapeutic drug administered to pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients. Despite its efficacy in treating leukemia, it can lead to severe peripheral neuropathy in a subgroup of the patients. Peripheral neuropathy is a debilitating and painful side-effect that can severely impact an individual’s quality of life. Currently, there are no established predictors of peripheral neuropathy incidence during the early stage of chemotherapeutic treatment. As a result, patients who are not susceptible to peripheral neuropathy may receive sub-therapeutic treatment due to an empirical upper cap on the dose, while others may experience severe neuropathy at the same dose. Contrary to previous genomics based approaches, we employed a metabolomics approach to identify small sets of metabolites that can be used to predict a patient’s susceptibility to peripheral neuropathy at different time points during the treatment. Using those identified metabolites, we developed a novel strategy to predict peripheral neuropathy and subsequently adjust the vincristine dose accordingly. In accordance with this novel strategy, we created a free user-friendly tool, VIPNp, for physicians to easily implement our prediction strategy. Our results showed that focusing on metabolites, which encompasses both genotypic and phenotypic variations, can enable early prediction of peripheral neuropathy in pediatric leukemia patients.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

The study aimed to develop a patient-tailored ADR web application, considering characteristics from 734 drugs and relevant patient related factors. The application was designed in Python using a scoring and ranking system based on frequency and severity, computed for each ADR and expressed through an online platform. A neural networks algorithm was used for predicting the severity of ADRs. The application inputs are: age, gender, drugs, relevant pathologies. The outputs are: an overall severity profile (hospitalization and mortality risk), a stratified risk on specific ADR groups and a sorted list of the most important ADRs depending on frequency and severity. The Severity prediction model validation resulted in 79.7–85.1% Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve Score, which lies in the good cut-off of 75–90%. The program offers a complex view regarding the ADR profile of a given patient and could be used by the physician and clinical pharmacist during patient safety monitoring, for a coherent therapy choice or medication adjustment, due to the good therapy coverage and the inclusion of relevant patient comorbidities.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

We studied 41 CSC eyes and their fellow eyes, and 41 normal eyes of 41 age-adjusted individuals. En-face optical coherence tomography image of the top 25% slab of Haller’s layer was analyze. The mean vessel area, vessel length, and vessel diameter were calculated. The running pattern of the vessels was quantified and used to determine the degree of symmetry, the “symmetry index”. The vessel area of CSC eyes was not significantly different from that of fellow eyes but significantly larger than that of normal eyes. The vessel length of CSC eyes was not significantly different from fellow eyes but significantly shorter than that of normal eyes. The mean vessel diameter was larger in CSC eyes than in the fellow eyes and the normal eye. The symmetry index was not significantly different in CSC eyes from that of their fellow eyes but was smaller than that of normal eyes.

A nonrandomized open-label phase 2 trial of nonischemic heart preservation for human heart transplantation,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-16782-9,12 Jun 2020,"Pre-clinical heart transplantation studies have shown that ex vivo non-ischemic heart preservation (NIHP) can be safely used for 24 h. Here we perform a prospective, open-label, non-randomized phase II study comparing NIHP to static cold preservation (SCS), the current standard for adult heart transplantation. All adult recipients on waiting lists for heart transplantation were included in the study, unless they met any exclusion criteria. The same standard acceptance criteria for donor hearts were used in both study arms. NIHP was scheduled in advance based on availability of device and trained team members. The primary endpoint was a composite of survival free of severe primary graft dysfunction, free of ECMO use within 7 days, and free of acute cellular rejection ≥2R within 180 days. Secondary endpoints were I/R-tissue injury, immediate graft function, and adverse events. Of the 31 eligible patients, six were assigned to NIHP and 25 to SCS. The median preservation time was 223 min (IQR, 202–263) for NIHP and 194 min (IQR, 164–223) for SCS. Over the first six months, all of the patients assigned to NIHP achieved event-free survival, compared with 18 of those assigned to SCS (Kaplan-Meier estimate of event free survival 72.0% [95% CI 50.0–86.0%]). CK-MB assessed 6 ± 2 h after ending perfusion was 76 (IQR, 50–101) ng/mL for NIHP compared with 138 (IQR, 72–198) ng/mL for SCS. Four deaths within six months after transplantation and three cardiac-related adverse events were reported in the SCS group compared with no deaths or cardiac-related adverse events in the NIHP group. This first-in-human study shows the feasibility and safety of NIHP for clinical use in heart transplantation.

Objective Assessment of Cerebellar Ataxia: A Comprehensive and Refined Approach,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-65303-7,11 Jun 2020,"Parametric analysis of Cerebellar Ataxia (CA) could be of immense value compared to its subjective clinical assessments. This study focuses on a comprehensive scheme for objective assessment of CA through the instrumented versions of 9 commonly used neurological tests in 5 domains- speech, upper limb, lower limb, gait and balance. Twenty-three individuals diagnosed with CA to varying degrees and eleven age-matched healthy controls were recruited. Wearable inertial sensors and Kinect camera were utilised for data acquisition. Binary and multilabel discrimination power and intra-domain relationships of the features extracted from the sensor measures and the clinical scores were compared using Graph Theory, Centrality Measures, Random Forest binary and multilabel classification approaches. An optimal subset of 13 most important Principal Component (PC) features were selected for CA-control classification. This classification model resulted in an impressive performance accuracy of 97% (F1 score = 95.2%) with Holmesian dimensions distributed as 47.7% Stability, 6.3% Timing, 38.75% Accuracy and 7.24% Rhythmicity. Another optimal subset of 11 PC features demonstrated an F1 score of 84.2% in mapping the total 27 PC across 5 domains during CA multilabel discrimination. In both cases, the balance (Romberg) test contributed the most (31.1% and 42% respectively), followed by the peripheral tests whereas gait (Walking) test contributed the least. These findings paved the way for a better understanding of the feasibility of an instrumented system to assist informed clinical decision-making.",Conclusions not available,Traditional ML,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Deep Learning for Improved Risk Prediction in Surgical Outcomes,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-62971-3,09 Jun 2020,"The Norwood surgical procedure restores functional systemic circulation in neonatal patients with single ventricle congenital heart defects, but this complex procedure carries a high mortality rate. In this study we address the need to provide an accurate patient specific risk prediction for one-year postoperative mortality or cardiac transplantation and prolonged length of hospital stay with the purpose of assisting clinicians and patients’ families in the preoperative decision making process. Currently available risk prediction models either do not provide patient specific risk factors or only predict in-hospital mortality rates. We apply machine learning models to predict and calculate individual patient risk for mortality and prolonged length of stay using the Pediatric Heart Network Single Ventricle Reconstruction trial dataset. We applied a Markov Chain Monte-Carlo simulation method to impute missing data and then fed the selected variables to multiple machine learning models. The individual risk of mortality or cardiac transplantation calculation produced by our deep neural network model demonstrated 89 ± 4% accuracy and 0.95 ± 0.02 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). The C-statistics results for prediction of prolonged length of stay were 85 ± 3% accuracy and AUROC 0.94 ± 0.04.

BacEffluxPred: A two-tier system to predict and categorize bacterial efflux mediated antibiotic resistance proteins,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-65981-3,09 Jun 2020,"Efflux proteins are transport proteins, which are involved in transporting different substrates from the cell to the external environment, including antibiotics. The efflux mechanism and efflux pumps are a major reason underlying emerging rampant antibiotic resistance (AR) in microbes. To reduce the resources required and time of identification, characterization and classification of bacterial efflux proteins, we have developed a fast and accurate support vector machine based two-tier prediction system, BacEffluxPred, which can predict bacterial efflux proteins responsible for AR and identify their corresponding families. A leave-one-out cross-validation also called jackknife procedure was used for performance evaluation. The accuracy to discriminate bacterial AR efflux from non-AR efflux was obtained as 85.81% (at tier-I) while accuracies for prediction of efflux pump families like ABC, MFS, RND and MATE family were found 92.13%, 85.39%, 91.01% and 99.44%, respectively (at tier-II). Benchmarking on an independent dataset also showed that BacEffluxPred had comparable accuracy for prediction of bacterial AR efflux pumps and their families.

A Nature-Inspired Search Space Reduction Technique for Spine Identification on Ultrasound Samples of Spina Bifida Cases,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-66468-x,09 Jun 2020,"Spina bifida is a birth defect caused by incomplete closing around the spinal cord. Spina bifida is diagnosed in a number of different ways. One approach involves searching for a deformity in the spinal axis via ultrasound. Although easy to apply, this approach requires a highly trained clinician to locate the abnormality due to the noise and distortion present in prenatal ultrasound images. Accordingly, visual examination of ultrasound images may be error prone and subjective. A computerized support system that would automatically detect the location of the spinal deformity may be helpful to the clinician in the diagnostic process. Such a software system first and foremost would require an algorithm for the identification of the entire (healthy or unhealthy) spine in the ultrasound image. This paper introduces a novel flocking dynamics based approach for reducing the size of the search space in the spine identification problem. Proposed approach accepts bone-like blobs on the ultrasound images as bird flocks and combine them into bone groups by calculating the migration path of each flock. Presented results reveal that the method is able to locate correct bones to be grouped together and reduce search space (i.e. number of bones) up to 68%.","In this study, we have proposed a novel nature inspired methodology for reducing the search space in the spine identification problem associated with the ultrasound images of SB cases. The proposed search algorithm has been seen to combine bone regions into groups effectively to reduce the total number of bone blobs forming the search space. The reduction rate is very much dependent on the nature of the sample image and has varied between 26% and 68% for the samples used (Table 1). Even with a moderate decrease in the number of bone regions, the possible number of combinations that would make a spine can decrease typically several orders of magnitude, which is a more significant simplification than the percentage value reflects. Hence, this reduction in search space increases the effectiveness of the GA drastically.In this research, the GA is merely used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the search space reduction. To prevent any performance loss associated with the GA, it based on a known ground truth. In such a case, a GA is guaranteed to capture the ground truth eventually. In an actual spine identification problem, an appropriate fitness function needs to be proposed, such that the GA can cluster the bone groups, “pre-clustered” by the search space reduction algorithm, into spine and non-spine bones. We have developed and evaluated such a fitness function in a follow-up study, which will be submitted as another manuscript in the coming days. The search space reduction algorithm has connected blobs without any interclass (i.e. spine with non-spine) connections in nine out of fourteen samples. False elimination (i.e. removal of isolated spine blobs) has not been observed in any of the samples. Even if there are false connections in one sample image, the interpolation polynomial that is fit on the identified spine is typically close to the ground truth polynomial and to the expert-curves drawn on the raw ultrasound images. This observation is related with the fact that falsely connected bone regions are typically small and do not shift the centroid location of the bone group very much. It should be noted that the ground truth polynomial passes through the centroids of the individual spine bones, whereas the interpolation polynomial passes through the centroids of the grouped bones. Even if all spine bones are correctly identified in the search space reduction, the interpolation polynomial will pass through the group centroids and deviate slightly from the ground truth polynomial. This is why we have a small but non-zero RMSE for samples that have no false connections (for example, Samples 1, 2, 5 and 6 on Table 4). For all practical purposes, these samples can be considered error-free.In this study, we have worked on SB cases due to its clinical significance but the algorithm can work on healthy spine samples as well. We have experimented on healthy samples and observed that the performance of the algorithm has been comparable to the SB cases.While this study does not intend to propose a computer aided diagnosis (CAD) system for SB, the proposed methodology, together with an appropriate fitness function, can constitute the first natural stage of such a CAD system.","Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Precision Targeted Ablation of Fine Neurovascular Structures In Vivo Using Dual-mode Ultrasound Arrays,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-66209-0,08 Jun 2020,"Carotid bodies (CBs) are chemoreceptors that monitor and register changes in the blood, including the levels of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and pH, and regulate breathing. Enhanced activity of CBs was shown to correlate with a significant elevation in the blood pressure of patients with hypertension. CB removal or denervation were previously shown to reduce hypertension. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of a dual-mode ultrasound array (DMUA) system to safely ablate the CB in vivo in a spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) model of hypertension. DMUA imaging was used for guiding and monitoring focused ultrasound (FUS) energy delivered to the target region. In particular, 3D imaging was used to identify the carotid bifurcation for targeting the CBs. Intermittent, high frame rate imaging during image-guided FUS (IgFUS) delivery was used for monitoring the lesion formation. DMUA imaging provided feedback for closed-loop control (CLC) of the lesion formation process to avoid overexposure. The procedure was tolerated well in over 100 SHR and normotensive rats that received unilateral and bilateral treatments. The measured mean arterial pressure (MAP) exhibited measurable deviation from baseline 2–4 weeks post IgFUS treatment. The results suggest that the direct unilateral FUS treatment of the CB might be sufficient to reduce the blood pressure in hypertensive rats and justify further investigation in large animals and eventually in human patients.",Conclusions not available,Gen AI,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Distinct methods are currently employed to mitigate the effects of confounding bias. Each requires the introduction of a set of covariates, which remains difficult to choose, especially regarding the different methods. We conduct a simulation study to compare the relative performance results obtained by using four different sets of covariates (those causing the outcome, those causing the treatment allocation, those causing both the outcome and the treatment allocation, and all the covariates) and four methods: g-computation, inverse probability of treatment weighting, full matching and targeted maximum likelihood estimator. Our simulations are in the context of a binary treatment, a binary outcome and baseline confounders. The simulations suggest that considering all the covariates causing the outcome led to the lowest bias and variance, particularly for g-computation. The consideration of all the covariates did not decrease the bias but significantly reduced the power. We apply these methods to two real-world examples that have clinical relevance, thereby illustrating the real-world importance of using these methods. We propose an R package RISCA to encourage the use of g-computation in causal inference.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Although automatic speech recognition software is commercially available, its accuracy in mental health settings has not been well described. It is unclear which metrics and thresholds are appropriate for different clinical use cases, which may range from population descriptions to individual safety monitoring. Here we show that automatic speech recognition is feasible in psychotherapy, but further improvements in accuracy are needed before widespread use. Our HIPAA-compliant automatic speech recognition system demonstrated a transcription word error rate of 25%. For depression-related utterances, sensitivity was 80% and positive predictive value was 83%. For clinician-identified harm-related sentences, the word error rate was 34%.

Although cell-free DNA (cfDNA) shows promise in detecting cancer mutations, we found that the combination of low tumor fraction (TF) and limited number of DNA fragments restricts low-disease-burden monitoring through the prevailing deep targeted sequencing paradigm. We reasoned that breadth may supplant depth of sequencing to overcome the barrier of cfDNA abundance. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of cfDNA allowed ultra-sensitive detection, capitalizing on the cumulative signal of thousands of somatic mutations observed in solid malignancies, with TF detection sensitivity as low as 10−5. The WGS approach enabled dynamic tumor burden tracking and postoperative residual disease detection, associated with adverse outcome. Thus, we present an orthogonal framework for cfDNA cancer monitoring via genome-wide mutational integration, enabling ultra-sensitive detection, overcoming the limitation of cfDNA abundance and empowering treatment optimization in low-disease-burden oncology care.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Health status among greenhouse workers exposed to different levels of pesticides: A genetic matching analysis,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-65662-1,26 May 2020,"(1) Objective: Greenhouse workers are considered a special occupational group who are exposed to more toxic and harmful substances than ordinary farmers. The health problem of this group is a public health problem that warrants attention. Taking greenhouse workers in Ningxia, China, as the research sample, this study analyzed the health risk to practitioners posed by the greenhouse working environment. (2) Method: To analyze the relationship between pesticide exposure and the health of greenhouse workers, the genetic matching method was used to exclude the influence of covariates on the results. (3) Results: The results showed a statistical significance regarding the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), skeletal muscle system diseases (SMSD) and digestive diseases between the different exposure groups. Researching the disease symptoms found that different levels of exposure to pesticides in greenhouses could cause multisystem and multisymptom discomfort. In addition to some irritant symptoms such as eye itching, itching, and sneezing, there were also differences in terms of the frequency of discomfort such as back pain, a decline in sleep quality, memory loss, joint pain, swelling and weakness, upper abdominal pain and flatulence, in the different exposure groups.

Homeostasis as a proportional–integral control system,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-020-0283-x,22 May 2020,"According to medical guidelines, the distinction between “healthy” and “unhealthy” patients is commonly based on single, discrete values taken at an isolated point in time (e.g., blood pressure or core temperature). Perhaps a more robust and insightful diagnosis can be obtained by studying the functional interdependence of such indicators and the homeostasis that controls them. This requires quasi-continuous measurements and a procedure to map the data onto a parsimonious control model with a degree of universality. The current research illustrates this approach using glucose homeostasis as a target. Data were obtained from 41 healthy subjects wearing over-the-counter glucose monitors, and projected onto a simple proportional–integral (PI) controller, widely used in engineering applications. The indicators quantifying the control function are clustered for the great majority of subjects, while a few outliers exhibit less responsive homeostasis. Practical implications for healthcare and education are further discussed.",Conclusions not available,Gen AI,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Epiretinal Membrane Detection at the Ophthalmologist Level using Deep Learning of Optical Coherence Tomography,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-65405-2,21 May 2020,"Purpose: Previous deep learning studies on optical coherence tomography (OCT) mainly focused on diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration. We proposed a deep learning model that can identify epiretinal membrane (ERM) in OCT with ophthalmologist-level performance. Design: Cross-sectional study. Participants: A total of 3,618 central fovea cross section OCT images from 1,475 eyes of 964 patients. Methods: We retrospectively collected 7,652 OCT images from 1,197 patients. From these images, 2,171 were normal and 1,447 were ERM OCT. A total of 3,141 OCT images was used as training dataset and 477 images as testing dataset. DL algorithm was used to train the interpretation model. Diagnostic results by four board-certified non-retinal specialized ophthalmologists on the testing dataset were compared with those generated by the DL model. Main Outcome Measures: We calculated for the derived DL model the following characteristics: sensitivity, specificity, F1 score and area under curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. These were calculated according to the gold standard results which were parallel diagnoses of the retinal specialist. Performance of the DL model was finally compared with that of non-retinal specialized ophthalmologists. Results: Regarding the diagnosis of ERM in OCT images, the trained DL model had the following characteristics in performance: sensitivity: 98.7%, specificity: 98.0%, and F1 score: 0.945. The accuracy on the training dataset was 99.7% (95% CI: 99.4 - 99.9%), and for the testing dataset, diagnostic accuracy was 98.1% (95% CI: 96.5 - 99.1%). AUC of the ROC curve was 0.999. The DL model slightly outperformed the average non-retinal specialized ophthalmologists. Conclusions: An ophthalmologist-level DL model was built here to accurately identify ERM in OCT images. The performance of the model was slightly better than the average non-retinal specialized ophthalmologists. The derived model may play a role to assist clinicians to promote the efficiency and safety of healthcare in the future.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Auditory Electrooculogram-based Communication System for ALS Patients in Transition from Locked-in to Complete Locked-in State,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-65333-1,21 May 2020,"Patients in the transition from locked-in (i.e., a state of almost complete paralysis with voluntary eye movement control, eye blinks or twitches of face muscles, and preserved consciousness) to complete locked-in state (i.e., total paralysis including paralysis of eye-muscles and loss of gaze-fixation, combined with preserved consciousness) are left without any means of communication. An auditory communication system based on electrooculogram (EOG) was developed to enable such patients to communicate. Four amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients in transition from locked-in state to completely locked-in state, with ALSFRS-R score of 0, unable to use eye trackers for communication, learned to use an auditory EOG-based communication system. The patients, with eye-movement amplitude between the range of ±200μV and ±40μV, were able to form complete sentences and communicate independently and freely, selecting letters from an auditory speller system. A follow-up of one year with one patient shows the feasibility of the proposed system in long-term use and the correlation between speller performance and eye-movement decay. The results of the auditory speller system have the potential to provide a means of communication to patient populations without gaze fixation ability and with low eye-movement amplitude range.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Machine-learning based exploration of determinants of gray matter volume in the KORA-MRI study,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-65040-x,20 May 2020,"To identify the most important factors that impact brain volume, while accounting for potential collinearity, we used a data-driven machine-learning approach. Gray Matter Volume (GMV) was derived from magnetic resonance imaging (3T, FLAIR) and adjusted for intracranial volume (ICV). 93 potential determinants of GMV from the categories sociodemographics, anthropometric measurements, cardio-metabolic variables, lifestyle factors, medication, sleep, and nutrition were obtained from 293 participants from a population-based cohort from Southern Germany. Elastic net regression was used to identify the most important determinants of ICV-adjusted GMV. The four variables age (selected in each of the 1000 splits), glomerular filtration rate (794 splits), diabetes (323 splits) and diabetes duration (122 splits) were identified to be most relevant predictors of GMV adjusted for intracranial volume. The elastic net model showed better performance compared to a constant linear regression (mean squared error = 1.10 vs. 1.59, p < 0.001). These findings are relevant for preventive and therapeutic considerations and for neuroimaging studies, as they suggest to take information on metabolic status and renal function into account as potential confounders.","In conclusion, this study shows that EN regression is a feasible machine-learning approach to identify predictors of ICV-adjusted GMV. The results from this data-driven exploratory analysis could potentially generate hypotheses for more focused, hypothesis-driven studies to follow. Additionally, the identification of diabetes-related parameters and GFR as important predictive variables for GMV suggests that these parameters should be taken into account in neuroimaging studies, especially when investigating effects of aging and neurodegeneration.","Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Quantification of tissue volume in the hindlimb of mice using microcomputed tomography images and analysing software,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-65214-7,19 May 2020,"When studying illnesses that cause disturbance in volume such as lymphedema, reliable quantification of tissue volume is important. Lymphedema results in swelling and enlargement of extremities and can be both physically and psychologically stressful to the patient. Experiments in rodent models provide a cost-effective research platform and are important for preclinical research on lymphedema. When performing such research, it can be crucial to measure the changes in tissue volume. Researchers must ensure that the risk of measurement error, when measuring the tissue volume, is as low as possible. The main goal of this article was to perform a comprehensive examination of the intra- and interrater agreement and hereby assess the risk of measurement error when using microcomputed tomography (µCT) images to measure hindlimb volume. We examined the agreement between four raters with different levels of prior experience and found that the risk of measurement error is extremely low when using this method. The main limitation of this method is that it is relatively expensive and time-consuming. The main advantages of this method are that it is easily learned and that it has a high intra- and interrater agreement, even for raters with no prior measuring experience.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Predicting conversion to wet age-related macular degeneration using deep learning,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0867-7,18 May 2020,"Progression to exudative ‘wet’ age-related macular degeneration (exAMD) is a major cause of visual deterioration. In patients diagnosed with exAMD in one eye, we introduce an artificial intelligence (AI) system to predict progression to exAMD in the second eye. By combining models based on three-dimensional (3D) optical coherence tomography images and corresponding automatic tissue maps, our system predicts conversion to exAMD within a clinically actionable 6-month time window, achieving a per-volumetric-scan sensitivity of 80% at 55% specificity, and 34% sensitivity at 90% specificity. This level of performance corresponds to true positives in 78% and 41% of individual eyes, and false positives in 56% and 17% of individual eyes at the high sensitivity and high specificity points, respectively. Moreover, we show that automatic tissue segmentation can identify anatomical changes before conversion and high-risk subgroups. This AI system overcomes substantial interobserver variability in expert predictions, performing better than five out of six experts, and demonstrates the potential of using AI to predict disease progression.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Machine Learning (ML) based-method applied in recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) patients diagnostic work-up: a potential innovation in common clinical practice,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-64512-4,14 May 2020,"RPL is a very debated condition, in which many issues concerning definition, etiological factors to investigate or therapies to apply are still controversial. ML could help clinicians to reach an objectiveness in RPL classification and access to care. Our aim was to stratify RPL patients in different risk classes by applying an ML algorithm, through a diagnostic work-up to validate it for the appropriate prognosis and potential therapeutic approach. 734 patients were enrolled and divided into 4 risk classes, according to the numbers of miscarriages. ML method, called Support Vector Machine (SVM), was used to analyze data. Using the whole set of 43 features and the set of the most informative 18 features we obtained comparable results: respectively 81.86 ± 0.35% and 81.71 ± 0.37% Unbalanced Accuracy. Applying the same method, introducing the only features recommended by ESHRE, a correct classification was obtained only in 58.52 ± 0.58%.

Generation and evaluation of artificial mental health records for Natural Language Processing,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-020-0267-x,14 May 2020,"A serious obstacle to the development of Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods in the clinical domain is the accessibility of textual data. The mental health domain is particularly challenging, partly because clinical documentation relies heavily on free text that is difficult to de-identify completely. This problem could be tackled by using artificial medical data. In this work, we present an approach to generate artificial clinical documents. We apply this approach to discharge summaries from a large mental healthcare provider and discharge summaries from an intensive care unit. We perform an extensive intrinsic evaluation where we (1) apply several measures of text preservation; (2) measure how much the model memorises training data; and (3) estimate clinical validity of the generated text based on a human evaluation task. Furthermore, we perform an extrinsic evaluation by studying the impact of using artificial text in a downstream NLP text classification task. We found that using this artificial data as training data can lead to classification results that are comparable to the original results. Additionally, using only a small amount of information from the original data to condition the generation of the artificial data is successful, which holds promise for reducing the risk of these artificial data retaining rare information from the original data. This is an important finding for our long-term goal of being able to generate artificial clinical data that can be released to the wider research community and accelerate advances in developing computational methods that use healthcare data.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

Such recordings produce a vast amount of complex data and variables which are difficult to comprehend. This makes data interpretation challenging. Machine learning approaches seem to be promising tools to support clinicians in identifying and categorizing specific gait patterns. However, the quality of such approaches strongly depends on the amount of available annotated data to train the underlying models. Therefore, we present GaitRec, a comprehensive and completely annotated large-scale dataset containing bi-lateral GRF walking trials of 2,084 patients with various musculoskeletal impairments and data from 211 healthy controls. The dataset comprises data of patients after joint replacement, fractures, ligament ruptures, and related disorders at the hip, knee, ankle or calcaneus during their entire stay(s) at a rehabilitation center. The data sum up to a total of 75,732 bi-lateral walking trials and enable researchers to classify gait patterns at a large-scale as well as to analyze the entire recovery process of patients.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
The usefulness of the Deep Learning method of variational autoencoder to reduce measurement noise in glaucomatous visual fields,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-64869-6,12 May 2020,"The aim of the study was to investigate the usefulness of processing visual field (VF) using a variational autoencoder (VAE). The training data consisted of 82,433 VFs from 16,836 eyes. Testing dataset 1 consisted of test-retest VFs from 104 eyes with open angle glaucoma. Testing dataset 2 was series of 10 VFs from 638 eyes with open angle glaucoma. A VAE model to reconstruct VF was developed using the training dataset. VFs in the testing dataset 1 were then reconstructed using the trained VAE and the mean total deviation (mTD) was calculated (mTDVAE). In testing dataset 2, the mTD value of the tenth VF was predicted using shorter series of VFs. A similar calculation was carried out using a weighted linear regression where the weights were equal to the absolute difference between mTD and mTDVAE. In testing dataset 1, there was a significant relationship between the difference between mTD and mTDVAE from the first VF and the difference between mTD in the first and second VFs. In testing dataset 2, mean squared prediction errors with the weighted mTD trend analysis were significantly smaller than those form the unweighted mTD trend analysis.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Novel artificial intelligence system increases the detection of prostate cancer in whole slide images of core needle biopsies,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41379-020-0551-y,11 May 2020,"Prostate cancer (PrCa) is the second most common cancer among men in the United States. The gold standard for detecting PrCa is the examination of prostate needle core biopsies. Diagnosis can be challenging, especially for small, well-differentiated cancers. Recently, machine learning algorithms have been developed for detecting PrCa in whole slide images (WSIs) with high test accuracy. However, the impact of these artificial intelligence systems on pathologic diagnosis is not known. To address this, we investigated how pathologists interact with Paige Prostate Alpha, a state-of-the-art PrCa detection system, in WSIs of prostate needle core biopsies stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Three AP-board certified pathologists assessed 304 anonymized prostate needle core biopsy WSIs in 8 hours. The pathologists classified each WSI as benign or cancerous. After ~4 weeks, pathologists were tasked with re-reviewing each WSI with the aid of Paige Prostate Alpha. For each WSI, Paige Prostate Alpha was used to perform cancer detection and, for WSIs where cancer was detected, the system marked the area where cancer was detected with the highest probability. The original diagnosis for each slide was rendered by genitourinary pathologists and incorporated any ancillary studies requested during the original diagnostic assessment. Against this ground truth, the pathologists and Paige Prostate Alpha were measured. Without Paige Prostate Alpha, pathologists had an average sensitivity of 74% and an average specificity of 97%. With Paige Prostate Alpha, the average sensitivity for pathologists significantly increased to 90% with no statistically significant change in specificity. With Paige Prostate Alpha, pathologists more often correctly classified smaller, lower grade tumors, and spent less time analyzing each WSI. Future studies will investigate if similar benefit is yielded when such a system is used to detect other forms of cancer in a setting that more closely emulates real practice.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) status prediction in histopathology images of gliomas using deep learning,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-64588-y,07 May 2020,"Mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase genes IDH1 and IDH2 are frequently found in diffuse and anaplastic astrocytic and oligodendroglial tumours as well as in secondary glioblastomas. As IDH is a very important prognostic, diagnostic and therapeutic biomarker for glioma, it is of paramount importance to determine its mutational status. The haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining is a valuable tool in precision oncology as it guides histopathology-based diagnosis and proceeding patient’s treatment. However, H&E staining alone does not determine the IDH mutational status of a tumour. Deep learning methods applied to MRI data have been demonstrated to be a useful tool in IDH status prediction, however the effectiveness of deep learning on H&E slides in the clinical setting has not been investigated so far. Furthermore, the performance of deep learning methods in medical imaging has been practically limited by small sample sizes currently available. Here we propose a data augmentation method based on the Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) deep learning methodology, to improve the prediction performance of IDH mutational status using H&E slides. The H&E slides were acquired from 266 grade II-IV glioma patients from a mixture of public and private databases, including 130 IDH-wildtype and 136 IDH-mutant patients. A baseline deep learning model without data augmentation achieved an accuracy of 0.794 (AUC = 0.920). With GAN-based data augmentation, the accuracy of the IDH mutational status prediction was improved to 0.853 (AUC = 0.927) when the 3,000 GAN generated training samples were added to the original training set (24,000 samples). By integrating also patients’ age into the model, the accuracy improved further to 0.882 (AUC = 0.931). Our findings show that deep learning methodology, enhanced by GAN data augmentation, can support physicians in gliomas’ IDH status prediction.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Prediction of the Mortality Risk in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients using Machine Learning Models: A Nation-wide Prospective Cohort in Korea,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-64184-0,04 May 2020,"Herein, we aim to assess mortality risk prediction in peritoneal dialysis patients using machine-learning algorithms for proper prognosis prediction. A total of 1,730 peritoneal dialysis patients in the CRC for ESRD prospective cohort from 2008 to 2014 were enrolled in this study. Classification algorithms were used for prediction of N-year mortality including neural network. The survival hazard ratio was presented by machine-learning algorithms using survival statistics and was compared to conventional algorithms. A survival-tree algorithm presented the most accurate prediction model and outperformed a conventional method such as Cox regression (concordance index 0.769 vs 0.745). Among various survival decision-tree models, the modified Charlson Comorbidity index (mCCI) was selected as the best predictor of mortality. If peritoneal dialysis patients with high mCCI (>4) were aged ≥70.5 years old, the survival hazard ratio was predicted as 4.61 compared to the overall study population. Among the various algorithm using longitudinal data, the AUC value of logistic regression was augmented at 0.804. In addition, the deep neural network significantly improved performance to 0.841. We propose machine learning-based final model, mCCI and age were interrelated as notable risk factors for mortality in Korean peritoneal dialysis patients.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Machine learning approach for prediction of hearing preservation in vestibular schwannoma surgery,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-64175-1,28 Apr 2020,"In vestibular schwannoma patients with functional hearing status, surgical resection while preserving the hearing is feasible. Hearing levels, tumor size, and location of the tumor have been known to be candidates of predictors. We used a machine learning approach to predict hearing outcomes in vestibular schwannoma patients who underwent hearing preservation surgery: middle cranial fossa, or retrosigmoid approach. After reviewing the medical records of 52 patients with a pathologically confirmed vestibular schwannoma, we included 50 patient’s records in the study. Hearing preservation was regarded as positive if the postoperative hearing was within serviceable hearing (50/50 rule). The categorical variable included the surgical approach, and the continuous variable covered audiometric and vestibular function tests, and the largest diameter of the tumor. Four different algorithms were lined up for comparison of accuracy: support vector machine(SVM), gradient boosting machine(GBM), deep neural network(DNN), and diffuse random forest(DRF). The average accuracy of predicting hearing preservation ranged from 62% (SVM) to 90% (DNN). The current study is the first to incorporate machine learning methodology into a prediction of successful hearing preservation surgery. Although a larger population may be needed for better generalization, this study could aid the surgeon’s decision to perform a hearing preservation approach for vestibular schwannoma surgery.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

BEHRT: Transformer for Electronic Health Records,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-62922-y,28 Apr 2020,"Today, despite decades of developments in medicine and the growing interest in precision healthcare, vast majority of diagnoses happen once patients begin to show noticeable signs of illness. Early indication and detection of diseases, however, can provide patients and carers with the chance of early intervention, better disease management, and efficient allocation of healthcare resources. The latest developments in machine learning (including deep learning) provides a great opportunity to address this unmet need. In this study, we introduce BEHRT: A deep neural sequence transduction model for electronic health records (EHR), capable of simultaneously predicting the likelihood of 301 conditions in one’s future visits. When trained and evaluated on the data from nearly 1.6 million individuals, BEHRT shows a striking improvement of 8.0–13.2% (in terms of average precision scores for different tasks), over the existing state-of-the-art deep EHR models. In addition to its scalability and superior accuracy, BEHRT enables personalised interpretation of its predictions; its flexible architecture enables it to incorporate multiple heterogeneous concepts (e.g., diagnosis, medication, measurements, and more) to further improve the accuracy of its predictions; its (pre-)training results in disease and patient representations can be useful for future studies (i.e., transfer learning).",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Prediction of Intracranial Aneurysm Risk using Machine Learning,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-63906-8,24 Apr 2020,"An efficient method for identifying subjects at high risk of an intracranial aneurysm (IA) is warranted to provide adequate radiological screening guidelines and effectively allocate medical resources. We developed a model for pre-diagnosis IA prediction using a national claims database and health examination records. Data from the National Health Screening Program in Korea were utilized as input for several machine learning algorithms: logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), scalable tree boosting system (XGB), and deep neural networks (DNN). Algorithm performance was evaluated through the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) using different test data from that employed for model training. Five risk groups were classified in ascending order of risk using model prediction probabilities. Incidence rate ratios between the lowest- and highest-risk groups were then compared. The XGB model produced the best IA risk prediction (AUROC of 0.765) and predicted the lowest IA incidence (3.20) in the lowest-risk group, whereas the RF model predicted the highest IA incidence (161.34) in the highest-risk group. The incidence rate ratios between the lowest- and highest-risk groups were 49.85, 35.85, 34.90, and 30.26 for the XGB, LR, DNN, and RF models, respectively.

"Development and validation of a deep neural network model to predict postoperative mortality, acute kidney injury, and reintubation using a single feature set",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-020-0248-0,20 Apr 2020,"During the perioperative period patients often suffer complications, including acute kidney injury (AKI), reintubation, and mortality. In order to effectively prevent these complications, high-risk patients must be readily identified. However, most current risk scores are designed to predict a single postoperative complication and often lack specificity on the patient level. In other fields, machine learning (ML) has been shown to successfully create models to predict multiple end points using a single input feature set. We hypothesized that ML can be used to create models to predict postoperative mortality, AKI, reintubation, and a combined outcome using a single set of features available at the end of surgery. A set of 46 features available at the end of surgery, including drug dosing, blood loss, vital signs, and others were extracted. Additionally, six additional features accounting for total intraoperative hypotension were extracted and trialed for different models. A total of 59,981 surgical procedures met inclusion criteria and the deep neural networks (DNN) were trained on 80% of the data, with 20% reserved for testing. The network performances were then compared to ASA Physical Status. In addition to creating separate models for each outcome, a multitask learning model was trialed that used information on all outcomes to predict the likelihood of each outcome individually. The overall rate of the examined complications in this data set was 0.79% for mortality, 22.3% (of 21,676 patients with creatinine values) for AKI, and 1.1% for reintubation. Overall, there was significant overlap between the various model types for each outcome, with no one modeling technique consistently performing the best. However, the best DNN models did beat the ASA score for all outcomes other than mortality. The highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) models were 0.792 (0.775–0.808) for AKI, 0.879 (0.851–0.905) for reintubation, 0.907 (0.872–0.938) for mortality, and 0.874 (0.864–0.866) for any outcome. The ASA score alone achieved AUCs of 0.652 (0.636–0.669) for AKI, 0.787 (0.757–0.818) for reintubation, 0.839 (0.804–0.875) for mortality, and 0.76 (0.748–0.773) for any outcome. Overall, the DNN architecture was able to create models that outperformed the ASA physical status to predict all outcomes based on a single feature set, consisting of objective data available at the end of surgery. No one model architecture consistently performed the best.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Influence of genetic factors in elbow tendon pathology: a case-control study,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-63030-7,16 Apr 2020,"Elbow tendinopathy is a common pathology of the upper extremity that impacts both athletes and workers. Some research has examined the genetic component as a risk factor for tendinopathy, mainly in the lower limbs. A case-control study was designed to test for a relationship between certain collagen gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and elbow tendon pathology. A sample of 137 young adult athletes whose sports participation involves loading of the upper limb were examined for the presence of structural abnormalities indicative of pathology in the tendons of the lateral and medial elbow using ultrasound imaging and genotyped for the following SNPs: COL5A1 rs12722, COL11A1 rs3753841, COL11A1 rs1676486, and COL11A2 rs1799907. Anthropometric measurements and data on participants’ elbow pain and dysfunction were collected using the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand and the Mayo Clinic Performance Index for the Elbow questionnaires. Results showed that participants in the structural abnormality group had significantly higher scores in pain and dysfunction. A significant relationship between COL11A1 rs3753841 genotype and elbow tendon pathology was found (p = 0.024), with the CT variant associated with increased risk of pathology.","In the present study, the genotype for SNP COL11A1 rs3753841 was associated with elbow tendon pathology; subjects in the pathology group were significantly more likely to have the CT genotype. None of the other SNPs studied showed a significant association.

Resolving challenges in deep learning-based analyses of histopathological images using explanation methods,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-62724-2,14 Apr 2020,"Deep learning has recently gained popularity in digital pathology due to its high prediction quality. However, the medical domain requires explanation and insight for a better understanding beyond standard quantitative performance evaluation. Recently, many explanation methods have emerged. This work shows how heatmaps generated by these explanation methods allow to resolve common challenges encountered in deep learning-based digital histopathology analyses. We elaborate on biases which are typically inherent in histopathological image data. In the binary classification task of tumour tissue discrimination in publicly available haematoxylin-eosin-stained images of various tumour entities, we investigate three types of biases: (1) biases which affect the entire dataset, (2) biases which are by chance correlated with class labels and (3) sampling biases. While standard analyses focus on patch-level evaluation, we advocate pixel-wise heatmaps, which offer a more precise and versatile diagnostic instrument. This insight is shown to not only be helpful to detect but also to remove the effects of common hidden biases, which improves generalisation within and across datasets. For example, we could see a trend of improved area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve by 5% when reducing a labelling bias. Explanation techniques are thus demonstrated to be a helpful and highly relevant tool for the development and the deployment phases within the life cycle of real-world applications in digital pathology.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Protected Health Information filter (Philter): accurately and securely de-identifying free-text clinical notes,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-020-0258-y,14 Apr 2020,"There is a great and growing need to ascertain what exactly is the state of a patient, in terms of disease progression, actual care practices, pathology, adverse events, and much more, beyond the paucity of data available in structured medical record data. Ascertaining these harder-to-reach data elements is now critical for the accurate phenotyping of complex traits, detection of adverse outcomes, efficacy of off-label drug use, and longitudinal patient surveillance. Clinical notes often contain the most detailed and relevant digital information about individual patients, the nuances of their diseases, the treatment strategies selected by physicians, and the resulting outcomes. However, notes remain largely unused for research because they contain Protected Health Information (PHI), which is synonymous with individually identifying data. Previous clinical note de-identification approaches have been rigid and still too inaccurate to see any substantial real-world use, primarily because they have been trained with too small medical text corpora. To build a new de-identification tool, we created the largest manually annotated clinical note corpus for PHI and develop a customizable open-source de-identification software called Philter (“Protected Health Information filter”). Here we describe the design and evaluation of Philter, and show how it offers substantial real-world improvements over prior methods.",Conclusions not available,Gen AI,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Artificial intelligence for the diagnosis of heart failure,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-020-0261-3,08 Apr 2020,"The diagnosis of heart failure can be difficult, even for heart failure specialists. Artificial Intelligence-Clinical Decision Support System (AI-CDSS) has the potential to assist physicians in heart failure diagnosis. The aim of this work was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of an AI-CDSS for heart failure. AI-CDSS for cardiology was developed with a hybrid (expert-driven and machine-learning-driven) approach of knowledge acquisition to evolve the knowledge base with heart failure diagnosis. A retrospective cohort of 1198 patients with and without heart failure was used for the development of AI-CDSS (training dataset, n = 600) and to test the performance (test dataset, n = 598). A prospective clinical pilot study of 97 patients with dyspnea was used to assess the diagnostic accuracy of AI-CDSS compared with that of non-heart failure specialists. The concordance rate between AI-CDSS and heart failure specialists was evaluated. In retrospective cohort, the concordance rate was 98.3% in the test dataset. The concordance rate for patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, heart failure with mid-range ejection fraction, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, and no heart failure was 100%, 100%, 99.6%, and 91.7%, respectively. In a prospective pilot study of 97 patients presenting with dyspnea to the outpatient clinic, 44% had heart failure. The concordance rate between AI-CDSS and heart failure specialists was 98%, whereas that between non-heart failure specialists and heart failure specialists was 76%. In conclusion, AI-CDSS showed a high diagnostic accuracy for heart failure. Therefore, AI-CDSS may be useful for the diagnosis of heart failure, especially when heart failure specialists are not available.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
A mountable toilet system for personalized health monitoring via the analysis of excreta,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-020-0534-9,06 Apr 2020,"Technologies for the longitudinal monitoring of a person’s health are poorly integrated with clinical workflows, and have rarely produced actionable biometric data for healthcare providers. Here, we describe easily deployable hardware and software for the long-term analysis of a user’s excreta through data collection and models of human health. The ‘smart’ toilet, which is self-contained and operates autonomously by leveraging pressure and motion sensors, analyses the user’s urine using a standard-of-care colorimetric assay that traces red–green–blue values from images of urinalysis strips, calculates the flow rate and volume of urine using computer vision as a uroflowmeter, and classifies stool according to the Bristol stool form scale using deep learning, with performance that is comparable to the performance of trained medical personnel. Each user of the toilet is identified through their fingerprint and the distinctive features of their anoderm, and the data are securely stored and analysed in an encrypted cloud server. The toilet may find uses in the screening, diagnosis and longitudinal monitoring of specific patient populations.",Conclusions not available,"DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
The cutaneous microbiome in hospitalized patients with pressure ulcers,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-62918-8,06 Apr 2020,This study investigated whether there are differences in the composition of the cutaneous microbiome of the unaffected skin between patients with pressure ulcers compared with those without pressure ulcers. The cutaneous microbiome of the unaffected skin of 15 patients with sacral pressure ulcers compared to 15 patients without pressure ulcers was analysed. It demonstrated that the inter-individual variation in skin microbiota of patients with pressure ulcers was significantly higher (P = 0.01). The abundance of 23 species was significantly different with Staphylococcus aureus and unclassified Enterococcus the most abundant species in patients with pressure ulcers. Random Forest models showed that eight species were associated with pressure ulcers occurrence in 81% of the patients. A subset of four species gave the strongest interaction. The presence of unclassified Enterococcus had the highest association with pressure ulcer occurrence. This study is the first to demonstrate that the cutaneous microbiome is altered in patients with pressure ulcers.,Conclusions not available,Gen AI,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Classifying post-traumatic stress disorder using the magnetoencephalographic connectome and machine learning,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-62713-5,03 Apr 2020,"Given the subjective nature of conventional diagnostic methods for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), an objectively measurable biomarker is highly desirable; especially to clinicians and researchers. Macroscopic neural circuits measured using magnetoencephalography (MEG) has previously been shown to be indicative of the PTSD phenotype and severity. In the present study, we employed a machine learning-based classification framework using MEG neural synchrony to distinguish combat-related PTSD from trauma-exposed controls. Support vector machine (SVM) was used as the core classification algorithm. A recursive random forest feature selection step was directly incorporated in the nested SVM cross validation process (CV-SVM-rRF-FS) for identifying the most important features for PTSD classification. For the five frequency bands tested, the CV-SVM-rRF-FS analysis selected the minimum numbers of edges per frequency that could serve as a PTSD signature and be used as the basis for SVM modelling. Many of the selected edges have been reported previously to be core in PTSD pathophysiology, with frequency-specific patterns also observed. Furthermore, the independent partial least squares discriminant analysis suggested low bias in the machine learning process. The final SVM models built with selected features showed excellent PTSD classification performance (area-under-curve value up to 0.9). Testament to its robustness when distinguishing individuals from a heavily traumatised control group, these developments for a classification model for PTSD also provide a comprehensive machine learning-based computational framework for classifying other mental health challenges using MEG connectome profiles.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Evaluating the performance of raw and epoch non-wear algorithms using multiple accelerometers and electrocardiogram recordings,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-62821-2,03 Apr 2020,"Accurate detection of accelerometer non-wear time is crucial for calculating physical activity summary statistics. In this study, we evaluated three epoch-based non-wear algorithms (Hecht, Troiano, and Choi) and one raw-based algorithm (Hees). In addition, we performed a sensitivity analysis to provide insight into the relationship between the algorithms’ hyperparameters and classification performance, as well as to generate tuned hyperparameter values to better detect episodes of wear and non-wear time. We used machine learning to construct a gold-standard dataset by combining two accelerometers and electrocardiogram recordings. The Hecht and Troiano algorithms achieved poor classification performance, while Choi exhibited moderate performance. Meanwhile, Hees outperformed all epoch-based algorithms. The sensitivity analysis and hyperparameter tuning revealed that all algorithms were able to achieve increased classification performance by employing larger intervals and windows, while more stringently defining artificial movement. These classification gains were associated with the ability to lower the false positives (type I error) and do not necessarily indicate a more accurate detection of the total non-wear time. Moreover, our results indicate that with tuned hyperparameters, epoch-based non-wear algorithms are able to perform just as well as raw-based non-wear algorithms with respect to their ability to correctly detect true wear and non-wear episodes.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Personalized predictions of patient outcomes during and after hospitalization using artificial intelligence,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-020-0249-z,03 Apr 2020,"Hospital systems, payers, and regulators have focused on reducing length of stay (LOS) and early readmission, with uncertain benefit. Interpretable machine learning (ML) may assist in transparently identifying the risk of important outcomes. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of hospitalizations at a tertiary academic medical center and its branches from January 2011 to May 2018. A consecutive sample of all hospitalizations in the study period were included. Algorithms were trained on medical, sociodemographic, and institutional variables to predict readmission, length of stay (LOS), and death within 48–72 h. Prediction performance was measured by area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC), Brier score loss (BSL), which measures how well predicted probability matches observed probability, and other metrics. Interpretations were generated using multiple feature extraction algorithms. The study cohort included 1,485,880 hospitalizations for 708,089 unique patients (median age of 59 years, first and third quartiles (QI) [39, 73]; 55.6% female; 71% white). There were 211,022 30-day readmissions for an overall readmission rate of 14% (for patients ≥65 years: 16%). Median LOS, including observation and labor and delivery patients, was 2.94 days (QI [1.67, 5.34]), or, if these patients are excluded, 3.71 days (QI [2.15, 6.51]). Predictive performance was as follows: 30-day readmission (AUC 0.76/BSL 0.11); LOS > 5 days (AUC 0.84/BSL 0.15); death within 48–72 h (AUC 0.91/BSL 0.001).

A machine learning algorithm for simulating immunohistochemistry: development of SOX10 virtual IHC and evaluation on primarily melanocytic neoplasms,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41379-020-0526-z,01 Apr 2020,"Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a diagnostic technique used throughout pathology. A machine learning algorithm that could predict individual cell immunophenotype based on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining would save money, time, and reduce tissue consumed. Prior approaches have lacked the spatial accuracy needed for cell-specific analytical tasks. Here IHC performed on destained H&E slides is used to create a neural network that is potentially capable of predicting individual cell immunophenotype. Twelve slides were stained with H&E and scanned to create digital whole slide images. The H&E slides were then destained, and stained with SOX10 IHC. The SOX10 IHC slides were scanned, and corresponding H&E and IHC digital images were registered. Color-thresholding and machine learning techniques were applied to the registered H&E and IHC images to segment 3,396,668 SOX10-negative cells and 306,166 SOX10-positive cells. The resulting segmentation was used to annotate the original H&E images, and a convolutional neural network was trained to predict SOX10 nuclear staining. Sixteen thousand three hundred and nine image patches were used to train the virtual IHC (vIHC) neural network, and 1,813 image patches were used to quantitatively evaluate it. The resulting vIHC neural network achieved an area under the curve of 0.9422 in a receiver operator characteristics analysis when sorting individual nuclei. The vIHC network was applied to additional images from clinical practice, and was evaluated qualitatively by a board-certified dermatopathologist. Further work is needed to make the process more efficient and accurate for clinical use. This proof-of-concept demonstrates the feasibility of creating neural network-driven vIHC assays.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Prediction model for short-term mortality after palliative radiotherapy for patients having advanced cancer: a cohort study from routine electronic medical data,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-62826-x,01 Apr 2020,"We developed a predictive score system for 30-day mortality after palliative radiotherapy by using predictors from routine electronic medical record. Patients with metastatic cancer receiving first course palliative radiotherapy from 1 July, 2007 to 31 December, 2017 were identified. 30-day mortality odds ratios and probabilities of the death predictive score were obtained using multivariable logistic regression model. Overall, 5,795 patients participated. Median follow-up was 39.6 months (range, 24.5–69.3) for all surviving patients. 5,290 patients died over a median 110 days, of whom 995 (17.2%) died within 30 days of radiotherapy commencement. The most important mortality predictors were primary lung cancer (odds ratio: 1.73, 95% confidence interval: 1.47–2.04) and log peripheral blood neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (odds ratio: 1.71, 95% confidence interval: 1.52–1.92). The developed predictive scoring system had 10 predictor variables and 20 points. The cross-validated area under curve was 0.81 (95% confidence interval: 0.79–0.82). The calibration suggested a reasonably good fit for the model (likelihood-ratio statistic: 2.81, P = 0.094), providing an accurate prediction for almost all 30-day mortality probabilities. The predictive scoring system accurately predicted 30-day mortality among patients with stage IV cancer.

The molecular etiology of deafness and auditory performance in the postlingually deafened cochlear implantees,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-62647-y,01 Apr 2020,"Recent advances in molecular genetic testing (MGT) have improved identification of genetic aetiology of candidates for cochlear implantation (CI). However, whether genetic information increases CI outcome predictability in post-lingual deafness remains unclear. Therefore, we evaluated the outcomes of CI with respect to genetic aetiology and clinical predictors by comparing the data of study subjects; those with an identified genetic aetiology (GD group), and those without identifiable variants (GUD group). First, we identified the genetic aetiology in 21 of 40 subjects and also observed genetic etiologic heterogeneity. The GD group demonstrated significantly greater improvement in speech perception scores over a 1-year period than did the GUD group. Further, inverse correlation between deafness duration and the 1-year improvement in speech perception scores was tighter in the GD group than in the GUD group. The weak correlation between deafness duration and CI outcomes in the GUD group might suggest the pathophysiology underlying GUD already significantly involves the cortex, leading to lesser sensitivity to further cortex issues such as deafness duration. Under our MGT protocol, the correlation between deafness duration and CI outcomes were found to rely on the presence of identifiable genetic aetiology, strongly advocating early CI in individual with proven genetic aetiologies.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Predicting Short-term Survival after Liver Transplantation using Machine Learning,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-62387-z,27 Mar 2020,"Liver transplantation is one of the most effective treatments for end-stage liver disease, but the demand for livers is much higher than the available donor livers. Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score is a commonly used approach to prioritize patients, but previous studies have indicated that MELD score may fail to predict well for the postoperative patients. This work proposes to use data-driven approach to devise a predictive model to predict postoperative survival within 30 days based on patient’s preoperative physiological measurement values. We use random forest (RF) to select important features, including clinically used features and new features discovered from physiological measurement values. Moreover, we propose a new imputation method to deal with the problem of missing values and the results show that it outperforms the other alternatives. In the predictive model, we use patients’ blood test data within 1–9 days before surgery to construct the model to predict postoperative patients’ survival. The experimental results on a real data set indicate that RF outperforms the other alternatives. The experimental results on the temporal validation set show that our proposed model achieves area under the curve (AUC) of 0.771 and specificity of 0.815, showing superior discrimination power in predicting postoperative survival.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Machine learning prediction of incidence of Alzheimer’s disease using large-scale administrative health data,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-020-0256-0,26 Mar 2020,"Nationwide population-based cohort provides a new opportunity to build an automated risk prediction model based on individuals’ history of health and healthcare beyond existing risk prediction models. We tested the possibility of machine learning models to predict future incidence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) using large-scale administrative health data. From the Korean National Health Insurance Service database between 2002 and 2010, we obtained de-identified health data in elders above 65 years (N = 40,736) containing 4,894 unique clinical features including ICD-10 codes, medication codes, laboratory values, history of personal and family illness and socio-demographics. To define incident AD we considered two operational definitions: “definite AD” with diagnostic codes and dementia medication (n = 614) and “probable AD” with only diagnosis (n = 2026). We trained and validated random forest, support vector machine and logistic regression to predict incident AD in 1, 2, 3, and 4 subsequent years. For predicting future incidence of AD in balanced samples (bootstrapping), the machine learning models showed reasonable performance in 1-year prediction with AUC of 0.775 and 0.759, based on “definite AD” and “probable AD” outcomes, respectively; in 2-year, 0.730 and 0.693; in 3-year, 0.677 and 0.644; in 4-year, 0.725 and 0.683. The results were similar when the entire (unbalanced) samples were used. Important clinical features selected in logistic regression included hemoglobin level, age and urine protein level. This study may shed a light on the utility of the data-driven machine learning model based on large-scale administrative health data in AD risk prediction, which may enable better selection of individuals at risk for AD in clinical trials or early detection in clinical settings.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Siamese neural networks for continuous disease severity evaluation and change detection in medical imaging,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-020-0255-1,26 Mar 2020,"Using medical images to evaluate disease severity and change over time is a routine and important task in clinical decision making. Grading systems are often used, but are unreliable as domain experts disagree on disease severity category thresholds. These discrete categories also do not reflect the underlying continuous spectrum of disease severity. To address these issues, we developed a convolutional Siamese neural network approach to evaluate disease severity at single time points and change between longitudinal patient visits on a continuous spectrum. We demonstrate this in two medical imaging domains: retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in retinal photographs and osteoarthritis in knee radiographs. Our patient cohorts consist of 4861 images from 870 patients in the Imaging and Informatics in Retinopathy of Prematurity (i-ROP) cohort study and 10,012 images from 3021 patients in the Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study (MOST), both of which feature longitudinal imaging data. Multiple expert clinician raters ranked 100 retinal images and 100 knee radiographs from excluded test sets for severity of ROP and osteoarthritis, respectively. The Siamese neural network output for each image in comparison to a pool of normal reference images correlates with disease severity rank (ρ = 0.87 for ROP and ρ = 0.89 for osteoarthritis), both within and between the clinical grading categories. Thus, this output can represent the continuous spectrum of disease severity at any single time point. The difference in these outputs can be used to show change over time. Alternatively, paired images from the same patient at two time points can be directly compared using the Siamese neural network, resulting in an additional continuous measure of change between images. Importantly, our approach does not require manual localization of the pathology of interest and requires only a binary label for training (same versus different). The location of disease and site of change detected by the algorithm can be visualized using an occlusion sensitivity map-based approach. For a longitudinal binary change detection task, our Siamese neural networks achieve test set receiving operator characteristic area under the curves (AUCs) of up to 0.90 in evaluating ROP or knee osteoarthritis change, depending on the change detection strategy. The overall performance on this binary task is similar compared to a conventional convolutional deep-neural network trained for multi-class classification. Our results demonstrate that convolutional Siamese neural networks can be a powerful tool for evaluating the continuous spectrum of disease severity and change in medical imaging.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
"Alzheimer’s disease, mild cognitive impairment, and normal aging distinguished by multi-modal parcellation and machine learning",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-62378-0,25 Mar 2020,"A 360-area surface-based cortical parcellation is extended to study mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) from healthy control (HC) using the joint human connectome project multi-modal parcellation (JHCPMMP) proposed by us. We propose a novel classification method named as JMMP-LRR to accurately identify different stages toward AD by integrating the JHCPMMP with the logistic regression-recursive feature elimination (LR-RFE). In three-group classification, the average accuracy is 89.0% for HC, MCI, and AD compared to previous studies using other cortical separation with the best classification accuracy of 81.5%. By counting the number of brain regions whose feature is in the feature subset selected with JMMP-LRR, we find that five brain areas often appear in the selected features. The five core brain areas are Fusiform Face Complex (L-FFC), Area 10d (L-10d), Orbital Frontal Complex (R-OFC), Perirhinal Ectorhinal (L-PeEc) and Area TG dorsal (L-TGd, R-TGd). The features corresponding to the five core brain areas are used to form a new feature subset for three classifications with the average accuracy of 80.0%. Results demonstrate the importance of the five core brain regions in identifying different stages toward AD. Experiment results show that the proposed method has better accuracy for the classification of HC, MCI, AD, and it also proves that the division of brain regions using JHCPMMP is more scientific and effective than other methods.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Development and Validation of a Semi-Automated Surveillance Algorithm for Cardiac Device Infections: Insights from the VA CART program,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-62083-y,24 Mar 2020,"Procedure-related cardiac electronic implantable device (CIED) infections have high morbidity and mortality, highlighting the urgent need for infection prevention efforts to include electrophysiology procedures. We developed and validated a semi-automated algorithm based on structured electronic health records data to reliably identify CIED infections. A sample of CIED procedures entered into the Veterans’ Health Administration Clinical Assessment Reporting and Tracking program from FY 2008–2015 was reviewed for the presence of CIED infection. This sample was then randomly divided into training (2/3) validation sets (1/3). The training set was used to develop a detection algorithm containing structured variables mapped from the clinical pathways of CIED infection. Performance of this algorithm was evaluated using the validation set. 2,107 unique CIED procedures from a cohort of 5,753 underwent manual review; 97 CIED infections (4.6%) were identified. Variables strongly associated with true infections included presence of a microbiology order, billing codes for surgical site infections and post-procedural antibiotic prescriptions. The combined algorithm to detect infection demonstrated high c-statistic (0.95; 95% confidence interval: 0.92–0.98), sensitivity (87.9%) and specificity (90.3%) in the validation data. Structured variables derived from clinical pathways can guide development of a semi-automated detection tool to surveil for CIED infection.","Existing surveillance structures for CIED infections are absent in many institutions, partially due to limited resources for detection and monitoring35. This study demonstrates that electronic surveillance tools based on structured data elements can be developed with high sensitivity and specificity and have the potential to expand measurement with audit and feedback to clinical areas that have not been served by traditional surveillance programs. Future improvements could include strategies to enhance detection of variables primarily captured in clinical notes.","Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

We did not find a distinct immune phenotype associated with OPV immunogenicity, although viral pathogens were more prevalent in stool at the time of immunization among infants who failed to seroconvert (63.9% vs. 45.6%, p = 0.002). Using a machine-learning approach, we could predict seroconversion a priori using immune parameters and infection status with a median 58% accuracy (cross-validation IQR: 50–69%) compared with 50% expected by chance. Better identification of immune predictors of OPV immunogenicity is likely to require sampling of mucosal tissue and improved oral poliovirus infection models.",Conclusions not available,Gen AI,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: ; Attacker Capability:

We performed immunogenomic profiling and highly multiplexed single-cell imaging on tumor samples from patients enrolled in a Phase I/II trial of niraparib and pembrolizumab in ovarian cancer (NCT02657889). We identify two determinants of response; mutational signature 3 reflecting defective homologous recombination DNA repair, and positive immune score as a surrogate of interferon-primed exhausted CD8 + T-cells in the tumor microenvironment. Presence of one or both features associates with an improved outcome while concurrent absence yields no responses. Single-cell spatial analysis reveals prominent interactions of exhausted CD8 + T-cells and PD-L1 + macrophages and PD-L1 + tumor cells as mechanistic determinants of response. Furthermore, spatial analysis of two extreme responders shows differential clustering of exhausted CD8 + T-cells with PD-L1 + macrophages in the first, and exhausted CD8 + T-cells with cancer cells harboring genomic PD-L1 and PD-L2 amplification in the second.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:

We developed an algorithm based on artificial vision and machine learning (and other classifiers) that predicts pregnancy using the beta human chorionic gonadotropin (b-hCG) test from both the morphology of an embryo and the age of the patients. We employed two high-quality databases with known pregnancy outcomes (n = 221). We created a system consisting of different classifiers that is feed with novel morphometric features extracted from the digital micrographs, along with other non-morphometric data to predict pregnancy. It was evaluated using five different classifiers: probabilistic bayesian, Support Vector Machines (SVM), deep neural network, decision tree, and Random Forest (RF), using a k-fold cross validation to assess the model’s generalization capabilities. In the database A, the SVM classifier achieved an F1 score of 0.74, and AUC of 0.77. In the database B the RF classifier obtained a F1 score of 0.71, and AUC of 0.75.

To test the ability of machine learning algorithms for predicting risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in a rural Chinese population, we focus on a total of 36,652 eligible participants from the Henan Rural Cohort Study. Risk assessment models for T2DM were developed using six machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression (LR), classification and regression tree (CART), artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF) and gradient boosting machine (GBM). The model performance was measured in an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and area under precision recall curve. The importance of variables was identified based on each classifier and the shapley additive explanations approach. Using all available variables, all models for predicting risk of T2DM demonstrated strong predictive performance, with AUCs ranging between 0.811 and 0.872 using laboratory data and from 0.767 to 0.817 without laboratory data. Among them, the GBM model performed best (AUC: 0.872 with laboratory data and 0.817 without laboratory data).

Among the top-10 variables across all methods were sweet flavor, urine glucose, age, heart rate, creatinine, waist circumference, uric acid, pulse pressure, insulin, and hypertension. New important risk factors (urinary indicators, sweet flavor) were not found in previous risk prediction methods, but determined by machine learning in our study. Through the results, machine learning methods showed competence in predicting risk of T2DM, leading to greater insights on disease risk factors with no priori assumption of causality.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Automated prediction of mastitis infection patterns in dairy herds using machine learning,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-61126-8,09 Mar 2020,"Mastitis in dairy cattle is extremely costly both in economic and welfare terms and is one of the most significant drivers of antimicrobial usage in dairy cattle. A critical step in the prevention of mastitis is the diagnosis of the predominant route of transmission of pathogens into either contagious (CONT) or environmental (ENV), with environmental being further subdivided as transmission during either the nonlactating “dry” period (EDP) or lactating period (EL). Using data from 1000 farms, random forest algorithms were able to replicate the complex herd level diagnoses made by specialist veterinary clinicians with a high degree of accuracy. An accuracy of 98%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 86% and negative predictive value (NPV) of 99% was achieved for the diagnosis of CONT vs ENV (with CONT as a “positive” diagnosis), and an accuracy of 78%, PPV of 76% and NPV of 81% for the diagnosis of EDP vs EL (with EDP as a “positive” diagnosis). An accurate, automated mastitis diagnosis tool has great potential to aid non-specialist veterinary clinicians to make a rapid herd level diagnosis and promptly implement appropriate control measures for an extremely damaging disease in terms of animal health, productivity, welfare and antimicrobial use.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Early prediction of circulatory failure in the intensive care unit using machine learning,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0789-4,09 Mar 2020,"Intensive-care clinicians are presented with large quantities of measurements from multiple monitoring systems. The limited ability of humans to process complex information hinders early recognition of patient deterioration, and high numbers of monitoring alarms lead to alarm fatigue. We used machine learning to develop an early-warning system that integrates measurements from multiple organ systems using a high-resolution database with 240 patient-years of data. It predicts 90% of circulatory-failure events in the test set, with 82% identified more than 2 h in advance, resulting in an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.94 and an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.63. On average, the system raises 0.05 alarms per patient and hour. The model was externally validated in an independent patient cohort. Our model provides early identification of patients at risk for circulatory failure with a much lower false-alarm rate than conventional threshold-based systems.",Conclusions not available,"Traditional ML, DNN, Gen AI",Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability: 
Cutaneous optical coherence tomography for longitudinal volumetric assessment of intradermal volumes in a mouse model,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-61276-9,06 Mar 2020,"Clinical evaluation of skin lesions requires precise and reproducible technologies for their qualitative and quantitative assessment. In this study, we investigate the applicability of a custom-built dermatologic OCT system for longitudinal assessment of intradermal volumes in a mouse model. The OCT, based on an akinetic swept laser working at 1310 nm was employed for visualization and quantification of intradermal deposits of three different hyaluronic acid-based hydrogel formulations – one commercial and two test substances. Hydrogels were applied in 22 BALB/c mice, and measurements were performed over a six-month time period. All hydrogels increased in volume within the first weeks and degraded steadily thereafter. The half-lifes of the test hydrogels (27.2 ± 13.6 weeks for Hydrogel 1, 31.5 ± 17.2 weeks for Hydrogel 2) were higher in comparison to the commercially available HA hydrogel (21.4 ± 12.0 weeks), although differences were not significant. The sphericity parameter was used for evaluation of the deposit geometry. While on the injection day the sphericities were similar (~0.75 ± 0.04), at later time points significant differences between the different test substances were found (T24: PRV 0.59 ± 0.09, Hydrogel 1 0.70 ± 0.11, Hydrogel 2 0.78 ± 0.07; p ≤ 0.012 for all pairs). This study shows the applicability of OCT imaging for quantitative assessment of the volumetric behavior of intradermal deposits in vivo.",Conclusions not available,,Attack Types: ; Attacker Identity: patient; Attacker Capability:
