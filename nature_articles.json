        "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a promising approach to identify new antimicrobial compounds in diverse microbial species. Here we developed an AI-based, explainable deep learning model, EvoGradient, that predicts the potency of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and virtually modifies peptide sequences to produce more potent AMPs, akin to in silico directed evolution. We applied this model to peptides encoded in low-abundance human oral bacteria, resulting in the virtual evolution of 32 peptides into potent AMPs. Of these, the 6 most effective were synthesized and tested against multidrug-resistant pathogens and demonstrated activity against carbapenem-resistant species Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. The most potent AMP, pep-19-mod, was validated in vivo, achieving over 95% reduction in bacterial loads in mouse models of thigh infection through both systemic and local administration. Our approach advances the automatic identification and optimization of AMPs."

        "abstract": "Neutralizing antibody titer has been a surrogate endpoint for guiding COVID-19 vaccine approval and use, although the pandemic’s evolution and the introduction of variant-adapted vaccine boosters raise questions as to this surrogate’s contemporary performance. For 985 recipients of an mRNA second bivalent or monovalent booster containing various Spike inserts [Prototype (Ancestral), Beta, Delta, and/or Omicron BA.1 or BA.4/5] in the COVAIL trial (NCT05289037), titers against 5 strains were assessed as correlates of risk of symptomatic COVID-19 (“COVID-19”) and as correlates of relative (Pfizer-BioNTech Omicron vs. Prototype) booster protection against COVID-19 over 6 months of follow-up during the BA.2-BA.5 Omicron-dominant period. Consistently across the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine platforms and across all variant Spike inserts assessed, both peak and exposure-proximal (“predicted-at-exposure”) titers correlated with lower Omicron COVID-19 risk in individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2, albeit significantly less so in naïve individuals [e.g., exposure-proximal hazard ratio per 10-fold increase in BA.1 titer 0.74 (95% CI 0.59, 0.94) for naïve vs. 0.41 (95% CI 0.23, 0.64) for non-naïve; interaction p = 0.013]. Neutralizing antibody titer was a strong inverse correlate of Omicron COVID-19 in non-naïve individuals and a weaker correlate in naïve individuals, posing questions about how prior infection alters the neutralization correlate."

This review evaluated the types and quality of ML methods in opioid safety research, identifying 44 studies using supervised ML through searches of Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed and SCOPUS databases. Commonly predicted outcomes included postoperative opioid use (n = 15, 34%) opioid overdose (n = 8, 18%), opioid use disorder (n = 8, 18%) and persistent opioid use (n = 5, 11%) with varying definitions. Most studies (96%) originated from North America, with only 7% reporting external validation. Model performance was moderate to strong, but calibration was often missing (41%). Transparent reporting of model development was often incomplete, with key aspects such as calibration, imbalance correction, and handling of missing data absent. Infrequent external validation limited the generalizability of current models. Addressing these aspects is critical for transparency, interpretability, and future implementation of the results."

Clinical and imaging data from 271 patients who had undergone enhanced CT scans after first-episode acute pancreatitis from March 2017–June 2023 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were classified into PPDM-A (n = 109) and non-PPDM-A groups (n = 162), and split into training (n = 189) and testing (n = 82) cohorts at a 7:3 ratio. 1223 radiomic features were extracted from CT images in the plain, arterial and venous phases, respectively. The radiomics model was developed based on the optimal features retained after dimensionality reduction, utilizing the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm. Five-fold cross-validation of the model was used to assess the performance of the model in the training and testing cohorts. The clinical performance of the model was assessed through a decision curve analysis, while insight into the predictions derived from this model was derived from Shapley additive explanations (SHAP). The final model incorporated five key radiomic features, and achieved area under the curve values in the training and testing cohorts of 0.947 (95% CI 0.915–0.979) and 0.901 (95% CI 0.838–0.964), respectively. SHAP analyses indicated that textural features were key features relevant to the prediction of PPDM-A incidence. The interpretable CT radiomics-based model developed in this study demonstrated good performance, enabling timely and effective interventions with the potential to improve patient outcomes."

EOS patients from our centre between 2007 and 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. Radiographic parameters include the cervical lordosis (CL), T1 slope, C2-C7 sagittal vertical axis (C2-7 SVA), primary curve Cobb angle, thoracic kyphosis (TK), C7-S1 sagittal vertical axis (C7-S1 SVA) and proximal junctional angle (PJA) were evaluated preoperatively, postoperatively and at the final follow-up. The parameters were analyzed using a t-test and χ2 test. The machine learning methodology of a sparse additive machine (SAM) was applied to identify the risk factors that caused the cervical imbalance. 138 patients were enrolled in this study (96 male and 42 female). The mean thoracic curve Cobb angle was 67.00 ± 22.74°. The mean age at the first operation was 8.5 ± 2.6yrs. The mean follow-up was 38.48 ± 10.87 months. CL, T1 slope, and C2-7 SVA increased significantly in the final follow-up compared with the pre-operative data. (P < 0.05). The CL and T1 slope increased more significantly in the group of patients who had proximal junctional kyphosis (PJK) compared with the patients without PJK (P < 0.05). The location of the upper instrumented vertebrae (UIV) and single/dual growing rod had no significant influence on the sagittal cervical parameters (P > 0.05). According to the SAM analysis of machine learning algorithms, Postoperative PJK, more improvement of kyphosis, and T1 slope angle were identified as the risk factors of cervical sagittal imbalance during the treatment of growing rod surgery. The growing rod surgery in EOS significantly affected the cervical sagittal alignment. Postoperative PJK and more improvement of kyphosis and T1 slope angle would lead to a higher incidence of cervical sagittal imbalance."

This study aims to find a noninvasive, cost-effective method using portable electroencephalography (EEG) to detect changes in AD-related biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). A total of 102 patients, both with and without AD-related biomarker changes (amyloid beta and phosphorylated tau), were recorded using a 2-minute resting-state portable EEG. A machine-learning algorithm then analyzed the EEG data to identify these biomarker changes. The results showed that the machine learning model could distinguish patients with AD-related biomarker changes, achieving 68.1% accuracy (AUROC 0.75) for amyloid beta and 71.2% accuracy (AUROC 0.77) for phosphorylated tau, with gamma activities being key features. When excluding cases with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus, accuracy improved to 74.1% (AUROC 0.80) for amyloid beta and 73.1% (AUROC 0.80) for phosphorylated tau. This study suggests that portable EEG combined with machine learning is a promising noninvasive and cost-effective tool for early AD-related pathological marker screening, which could enhance neurophysiological understanding and diagnostic accessibility."

Chronic pathological changes associated with a wide range of systemic diseases, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, and rheumatological conditions like systemic sclerosis, can manifest as observable microvascular changes in the terminal capillaries of nailfolds. The current gold standard relies on experts performing manual evaluations, which is an exhaustive time-intensive, and subjective process. In this study, we demonstrate the viability of a deep learning approach as an automated clinical screening tool. Our dataset consists of NFC images from a total of 225 participants, with normal images accounting for 6% of the dataset. This study introduces a robust framework utilizing cascade transfer learning based on EfficientNet-B0 to differentiate between normal and abnormal cases within NFC images. The results demonstrate that pre-trained EfficientNet-B0 on the ImageNet dataset, followed by transfer learning from domain-specific classes, significantly enhances the classifier’s performance in distinguishing between Normal and Abnormal classes. Our proposed model achieved superior performance, with accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC_AUC of 1.00, significantly outperforming both models of single transfer learning on the pre-trained EfficientNet-B0 and cascade transfer learning on a convolutional neural network, which each attained an accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score of 0.67 and a ROC_AUC of 0.83. The framework demonstrates the potential to facilitate early preventive measures and timely interventions that aim to improve healthcare delivery and patients’ quality of life."

However, the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound, the sole prenatal screening tool, remains limited. Failed prenatal or early newborn detection of cyanotic CHD (CCHD) can have disastrous consequences. We therefore sought to use a Precision Fetal Cardiology based approach combining metabolomic profiling of maternal saliva and machine learning, a major branch of artificial intelligence (AI), for the prenatal detection of isolated, non-syndromic cyanotic CHD. Metabolomic analyses using Ultra-High Performance Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry identified 468 metabolites in the saliva. Six different AI platforms were utilized for the detection of CCHD and CHD overall. AI achieved excellent accuracy for the CCHD detection: Area Under the ROC curve: AUC (95% CI) = 0.819 (0.635-1.00) with a sensitivity and specificity of 92.5% and 87.0%, and for CHD overall: AUC (95% CI) = 0.828 (0.635-1.00) with a sensitivity of 90.5% and specificity of 88.0%. Similarly high accuracies were achieved for the detection of CHD overall: AUC (95% CI) = 0.8488 (0.635-1.00) with a sensitivity of 92.5% and specificity of 91.0%. Pathway analysis showed significant alterations in Arachidonic Acid, Alpha-linoleic acid, and Tryptophan metabolism indicating significant lipid dysfunction in cyanotic CHD. In summary, we report for the first time, the accurate detection of non-syndromic cyanotic CHD using maternal salivary metabolomics.

        "abstract": "Typical waveforms used for the simulation of pressure and volume-controlled ventilation in medical ventilators have been extensively studied in the literature. The majority of simulation studies reported employ the step pattern or ramp pattern to model the pressure and flow variations in pressure/volume-controlled ventilation. It was observed that the above waveforms tend to add to the discomfort level of patients due to the presence of jerks in derivatives of pressure/flow variations; the pressure/flow variation of air and oxygen mixture should be smooth so that the patient discomfort is kept at a minimal level. To overcome the above-mentioned drawback, a careful study of the flow/pressure simulation using a cycloidal pattern during the inhalation and exhalation phases of the breath cycle was proposed and investigated in this work. Based on transient analysis of the pressure variation simulation, it was observed that the air and oxygen mixture delivered to the patient was relatively jerk-free due to the finite values of first and second-order derivatives of pressure/flow curves. Mathematical models of the proposed simulation study of the cycloidal pattern of flow variation in both pressure/volume-controlled ventilation, are formulated and presented for use by ventilator designers. A comparative study of the simulation of step, ramp and cycloidal profiles applied to the breath cycle in a typical pressure-controlled ventilation is carried out and a marginal decrease in tidal volumes was observed in the case of cycloidal profiles for a given set of ventilator settings and the results are discussed. A typical natural breath pattern of a healthy adult was experimentally measured using a CITRIX breath analyser and the above mathematical model for the volume-controlled ventilation was found to closely describe the natural breathing process, using statistical parameters. Thus, the proposed cycloidal profile of pressure/flow variations in medical ventilators will be a better alternative, when compared to the step/ramp profiles investigated in this work; further, the proposed cycloidal profile matches closely with the natural breath pattern, based on typical experimental studies."

In this study, multilevel functional metrics including resting state functional connectivity, amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF), and regional homogeneity (ReHo) were calculated and extracted from 116 regions of interest in the anatomical automatic labeling atlas. Subsequently, classifiers were developed using different combinations of these selected features to distinguish between MS and NMOSD. Compared to models based on individual MRI features, support vector machine (SVM) and logistic regression (LR) models that integrated multilevel functional features such as RSFC, ALFF, and ReHo demonstrated the highest levels of performance on the testing cohorts (SVM, AUC = 0.857; LR, AUC = 0.929). Adding structural features of gray matter volume (GMV) data did not notably improve the classification performance of the machine learning models using multilevel rs-fMRI features. Notably, similar trends were observed across different brain templates, with models based on RSFC, ALFF, and ReHo yielding optimal performance. These findings suggest that utilizing multilevel fMRI features can effectively differentiate between MS and NMOSD patients."

To guide therapeutic selection, we sought to create an immunophenotyping platform able to identify aberrant cell populations and cytokines in subtypes of erythroderma. We performed high-parameter flow cytometry on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and whole blood of a patient with refractory idiopathic erythroderma, erythrodermic patients with Sézary syndrome and pityriasis rubra pilaris, and healthy controls. We found that the index patient had a novel form of erythroderma characterized by increased interleukin (IL)-13- and IL-17-producing γVδ2 T cells, basophils, and activated platelets. Whole-genome sequencing of PBMCs and immunofluorescence staining of skin biopsies revealed increased expression of Th2- (IL-13, IL-4Rα) and Th17-associated markers (IL-17, IL-17Rα) and non-functional mutations associated with Th2 and Th17 signaling, demonstrating that PBMCs can reflect cutaneous disease pathology. Targeted intervention via dual dupilumab and secukinumab therapy resulted in complete disease control and reduction of immunopathogenic cell populations and cytokines. This study highlights a novel form of erythroderma with concomitant Th2 and Th17 dysregulation and introduces a minimally invasive peripheral blood-based immunophenotyping platform that offers a personalized medicine approach to the management of systemic inflammatory diseases."

However, their metacognitive abilities, crucial for medical decision-making, remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we developed MetaMedQA, a benchmark incorporating confidence scores and metacognitive tasks into multiple-choice medical questions. We evaluated twelve models on dimensions including confidence-based accuracy, missing answer recall, and unknown recall. Despite high accuracy on multiple-choice questions, our study revealed significant metacognitive deficiencies across all tested models. Models consistently failed to recognize their knowledge limitations and provided confident answers even when correct options were absent. In this work, we show that current models exhibit a critical disconnect between perceived and actual capabilities in medical reasoning, posing significant risks in clinical settings.

The contribution of immune dysregulation to PE is not fully understood, highlighting the need to explore molecular markers and their relationship with immune infiltration to potentially inform therapeutic strategies. We used bioinformatics tools to analyze gene expression data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database using the GEOquery package in R. Differential expression analysis was performed using the DESeq2 and limma packages, followed by analysis of variance to identify immune-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Several machine learning algorithms, including least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), bagged trees, and random forest (RF), were used to select immune-related signaling genes closely associated with the occurrence of PE. Our analysis identified 34 immune source–related DEGs. Using the identified PE- and immune source–related genes, we constructed a diagnostic forecasting model employing several ML algorithms. We identified six types of statistically significant immune cells in patients with PE and discovered a strong relationship between biomarkers and immune cells. Moreover, the immune-derived hub genes for PE exhibited strong binding capabilities with drugs, such as alitretinoin, tretinoin, and acitretin. This study presents a robust prediction model for PE that integrates multiple machine learning–derived immune-related biomarkers. Our results indicate that these biomarkers may outperform previously reported molecular signatures in predicting PE and provide insights into the mechanisms underlying immune dysregulation in PE. Further validation in larger cohorts could lead to their clinical application in PE prediction and treatment."

Early detection becomes essential, as the rate of death associated with it is high, to ensure that the rate of treatment success is up, and mortality reduced. This paper focuses on improving blood cancer diagnosis using advanced deep learning techniques like ResNetRS50, RegNetX016, AlexNet, Convnext, EfficientNet, Inception_V3, Xception, and VGG19. Among the models assessed, ResNetRS50 had better accuracy and speed with minimal error rates compared with other state-of-the-arts. This work will exploit the power of ResNetRS50 in contributing to early detection and reducing bad outcomes for blood cancer patients. Blood cancer is currently one of the deadliest diseases worldwide, resulting from a combination of genetic and non-genetic factors. It stands as a leading cause of cancer-related deaths in both developed and developing nations. Early detection of cancer is pivotal in reducing mortality rates, as it increases the likelihood of successful treatment and potential cure. The objective is to decrease mortality rates through early diagnosis of blood cancer, thus offering individuals a better chance of survival from this disease."

        "abstract": "Language-supervised pretraining has proven to be a valuable method for extracting semantically meaningful features from images, serving as a foundational element in multimodal systems within the computer vision and medical imaging domains. However, the computed features are limited by the information contained in the text, which is particularly problematic in medical imaging, in which the findings described by radiologists focus on specific observations. This challenge is compounded by the scarcity of paired imaging–text data due to concerns over the leakage of personal health information. In this work, we fundamentally challenge the prevailing reliance on language supervision for learning general-purpose biomedical imaging encoders. We introduce RAD-DINO, a biomedical image encoder pretrained solely on unimodal biomedical imaging data that obtains similar or greater performance than state-of-the-art biomedical-language-supervised models on a diverse range of benchmarks. Specifically, the quality of learned representations is evaluated on standard imaging tasks (classification and semantic segmentation), and a vision–language alignment task (text report generation from images). To further demonstrate the drawback of language supervision, we show that features from RAD-DINO correlate with other medical records (for example, sex or age) better than language-supervised models, which are generally not mentioned in radiology reports. Finally, we conduct a series of ablations determining the factors in RAD-DINO’s performance. In particular, we observe that RAD-DINO’s downstream performance scales well with the quantity and diversity of training data, demonstrating that image-only supervision is a scalable approach for training a foundational biomedical image encoder."

The resultant regression equation predicts expected TEE from easily acquired variables, such as body weight, age and sex, with 95% predictive limits that can be used to screen for misreporting by participants in dietary studies. We applied the equation to two large datasets (National Diet and Nutrition Survey and National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) and found that the level of misreporting was >50%. The macronutrient composition from dietary reports in these studies was systematically biased as the level of misreporting increased, leading to potentially spurious associations between diet components and body mass index."

        "abstract": "Due to the lack of efficient mpox diagnostic technology, mpox cases continue to increase. Recently, the great potential of deep learning models in detecting mpox and non-mpox has been proven. However, existing methods are susceptible to interference from various noises in real-world settings, require diverse non-mpox images, and fail to detect abnormal input, which makes them unsuitable for practical deployment and application. To address these challenges, we proposed a novel strategy based on image inpainting called “Mask, Inpainting, and Measure” (MIM). In MIM’s pipeline, a generative adversarial network learns feature representations of mpox images by inpainting the masked mpox images. On this basis, MIM measure the similarity between the inpainted image and the original image to detect mpox and non-mpox. Compared with multi-class classification models, MIM can handle unknown categories and abnormal inputs more effectively. We used the recognized mpox dataset (MSLD) and a dataset containing 18 categories of non-mpox skin diseases to verify the effectiveness and robustness of MIM. Experimental results show that the average AUROC of MIM achieves 0.8237. In addition, external clinical testing further demonstrates the robustness of MIM. Importantly, we developed a free smartphone app to help the public and healthcare professionals detect mpox more conveniently."

However, there are some concerns about the PST including the process of preoperative planning, 3D printing and material, positioning of PST intraoperatively, availability, and clinical value. The purpose of this study was to validate the technical accuracy and reliability of the PST technique in the lab and to report the outcomes of clinical application. To test the reliability of the PST technique, five observers positioned the PST templates five times over the distal femur and proximal tibial whilst a navigation system was used to measure the level of bone cutting, coronal and sagittal alignment, and rotation in both femur and tibia. The mean alignment error in all planes was 0.67° (maximum 2.5°). Concerning the bone (femoral and tibial) cutting, the mean error was 0.32 mm (maximum 1 mm). The qualitative and quantitative analysis showed an overall agreement between observers (p < 0.05). The laboratory part of this study showed that the positioning of the PST over the proximal tibia and distal femur during TKA is reliable. There were statistically insignificant intraobserver and interobserver variations."

        "abstract": "Heart failure is a common and deadly disease requiring new treatments. The neuregulin-1/ERBB4 pathway offers cardioprotective benefits, but using recombinant neuregulin-1 as therapy has limitations due to the need for intravenous delivery and lack of receptor specificity. We hypothesize that small-molecule activation of ERBB4 could protect against heart damage and fibrosis. To test this, we conduct a screening of 10,240 compounds and identify eight structurally similar ones (EF-1 to EF-8) that induce ERBB4 dimerization, with EF-1 being the most effective. EF-1 reduces cell death and hypertrophy in cardiomyocytes and decreases collagen production in cardiac fibroblasts in an ERBB4-dependent manner. In wild-type mice, EF-1 inhibits angiotensin-II-induced fibrosis in males and females and reduces heart damage caused by doxorubicin and myocardial infarction in females, but not in Erbb4-null mice. This study shows that small-molecule ERBB4 activation is feasible and may lead to a novel class of drugs for treating heart failure."

        "abstract": "Breast cancer prognosis is complicated by tumor heterogeneity. Traditional methods focus on cancer-specific gene signatures, but cross-cancer strategies that provide deeper insights into tumor homogeneity are rarely used. Immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors, results from variable responses across cancers, offering valuable prognostic insights. We introduced a network-based transfer (NBT) of pan-cancer immunotherapy responses to enhance breast cancer prognosis using node embedding and heat diffusion algorithms, identifying gene signatures netNE and netHD. Our results showed that netHD and netNE outperformed seven established breast cancer signatures in prognostic metrics, with netHD excelling. All nine gene signatures were grouped into three clusters, with netHD and netNE enriching the immune-related interferon-gamma pathway. Stratifying TCGA patients into two groups based on netHD revealed significant immunological differences and variations in 20 of 50 cancer hallmarks, emphasizing immune-related markers. This approach leverages pan-cancer insights to enhance breast cancer prognosis, facilitating insight transfer and improving tumor homogeneity understanding."

        "abstract": "Analyzing video footage of falls in older adults has emerged as an alternative to traditional lab studies. However, this approach is limited by the labor-intensive process of manually labeling body parts. To address this limitation, we aimed to validate the use of the AI-based pose estimation algorithm (OpenPose) in assessing the hip impact velocity and acceleration of video-captured falls. We analyzed 110 videos of 13 older adults (64.0 ± 5.9 years old) falling sideways in an experimental setting. By applying OpenPose to each video, we generated a time series of hip positions in the video, which were then analyzed using custom MATLAB code to calculate hip impact velocity and acceleration. These calculations were compared against ground truth measurements obtained from motion capture systems (VICON for hip impact velocity) and inertial measurement units (MC10 for hip impact acceleration). We examined the agreement between the ground truth and OpenPose measurements in terms of mean of absolute error (MAE), mean of absolute percentage error (MAPE), and bias (mean of error). Results showed that OpenPose had a good accuracy in estimating hip impact velocity with minimal bias (MAE: 0.17 ± 0.13 m/s, MAPE: 7.28 ± 5.21%; percent bias: − 1.27%). However, its estimation of hip impact acceleration (i.e., peak vertical hip acceleration at impact) showed poor accuracy (MAPE: 26.3 ± 19.4%), showing substantial underestimation in instances of high acceleration impacts (> 3.0 g). Further ANOVA analysis revealed OpenPose’s ability to discern significant differences in hip impact velocity and acceleration based on the movement response utilized during the fall (e.g., stick-like fall, tuck-and-roll, knee block). This is the first study to validate the use of a pose estimation algorithm for identifying the hip impact kinematics in video-captured falls among older adults. Future validation studies involving diverse camera settings, fall contexts, and biomechanical parameters are warranted to extend this support for using pose estimation algorithms in this field."

Here we developed a random forest trained model for mitochondrial haplogroup calling using data procured from GWAS arrays. Our results reveal that in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, HV branch were found to represent protective factors against the development of critical SARS-CoV-2 in an analysis of 14,349 patients. These results highlight the role of mtDNA in the response to infectious diseases and support the proposal that its expansion and population proportion has been influenced by selection through successive pandemics."

Results demonstrate that OrthoFusion significantly reduced segmentation time, while improving structural similarity of bone images and relative accuracy of derived bone model geometries. Moreover, it proved beneficial in the context of biplane videoradiography, enhancing the similarity of digitally reconstructed radiographs to radiographic images and improving the accuracy of relative bony kinematics. OrthoFusion’s simplicity, ease of implementation, and generalizability make it a valuable tool for researchers and clinicians seeking high spatial resolution from existing clinical CT data. This study opens new avenues for retrospectively utilizing clinical images for research and advanced clinical purposes, while reducing the need for additional scans, mitigating associated costs and radiation exposure."

This study aimed to verify whether and how EPDL values affect the stress distribution over the tooth and periodontium structures, and to determine the appropriate EPDL range. A 3D multi-component human first premolar model was created based on a cone-beam computed tomography dataset. Finite element analysis was performed to analyze stress distribution and deformation of the structures under an average Asian occlusal force with different EPDL values (0.0689–68.9 MPa). The low EPDL caused excessive PDL deformation, contributing to a non-uniform stress distribution and localized stress concentration, especially in the cementum, enamel, and dentin. With the low EPDL value, the stress magnitude was overestimated by 1,195%, potentially leading to erroneous conclusions regarding material failure and tooth movement. The EPDL value significantly affects the stress magnitude and distribution over the tooth and periodontium. The appropriate EPDL range of 0.964 ± 0.276 MPa is suggested for human first premolars to ensure accurate and reliable FEA simulations and help avoid misinterpretation of the stress results, which could compromise orthodontic planning and restoration design."

ERS-related differentially expressed genes (ERSRGs) were identified through Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of genes and genomes analyses, and their diagnostic potential was assessed. Diagnostic models were developed using logistic regression, support vector machines, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operators, complemented by immune infiltration analysis and regulatory network construction. Integrated analysis revealed 1395 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including 626 upregulated and 769 downregulated genes. Seventeen ERSRGs were identified. KEAP1 and YIPF5 displayed high diagnostic accuracy (area under the curve [AUC] > 0.9). Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of genes and genomes analyses highlighted the role of ESRDEGs in cellular responses to ERS, protein processing, and apoptosis. Diagnostic models demonstrated robust predictive performance (AUC > 0.9). A molecular interaction was found between RM and the ERS response, and the identified ESRDEGs could serve as potential biomarkers for diagnosis."

We surveyed 3,655 participants about psychological health and COVID-19-related circumstances every 2 weeks for 6 months. We combined self-reports with regional social distancing estimates and a classifier that predicted probability of psychiatric diagnosis at enrollment. Loneliness and psychiatric vulnerability both impacted psychological distress. Loneliness and distress were also linked to social isolation and stress associated with distancing, and psychiatric vulnerability shaped how regional distancing affected loneliness across time. Public health policies should address loneliness when encouraging social distancing, particularly in those at risk for psychiatric conditions."

DeepMerkel can make accurate personalised, time-dependent survival predictions for MCC from readily available clinical information. It demonstrated generalizability through high predictive performance in an international clinical cohort, out-performing current population-based prognostic staging systems.

        "abstract": "Deep learning-based medical image analysis has shown strong potential in disease categorization, segmentation, detection, and even prediction. However, in high-stakes and complex domains like healthcare, the opaque nature of these models makes it challenging to trust predictions, particularly in uncertain cases. This sort of uncertainty can be crucial in medical image analysis; diabetic retinopathy is an example where even slight errors without an indication of confidence can have adverse impacts. Traditional deep learning models rely on single-point predictions, limiting their ability to provide uncertainty measures essential for robust clinical decision-making. To solve this issue, Bayesian approximation approaches have evolved and are gaining market traction. In this work, we implemented a transfer learning approach, building upon the DenseNet-121 convolutional neural network to detect diabetic retinopathy, followed by Bayesian extensions to the trained model. Bayesian approximation techniques, including Monte Carlo Dropout, Mean Field Variational Inference, and Deterministic Inference, were applied to represent the posterior predictive distribution, allowing us to evaluate uncertainty in model predictions. Our experiments on a combined dataset (APTOS 2019 + DDR) with pre-processed images showed that the Bayesian-augmented DenseNet-121 outperforms state-of-the-art models in test accuracy, achieving 97.68% for the Monte Carlo Dropout model, 94.23% for Mean Field Variational Inference, and 91.44% for the Deterministic model. We also measure how certain the predictions are, using an entropy and a standard deviation metric for each approach. We also evaluated the model using both AUC and accuracy scores at multiple data retention levels. In addition to overall performance boosts, these results highlight that Bayesian deep learning does not only improve classification accuracy in the detection of diabetic retinopathy but also reveals beneficial insights about how uncertainty estimation can help build more trustworthy clinical decision-making solutions."

        "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative bone disease characterized by the destruction of joint cartilage and synovial inflammation, involving intricate immune regulation processes. Disulfidptosis, a novel form of programmed cell death, has recently been identified; however, the effects and roles of disulfidptosis-related genes (DR-DEGs) in OA remain unclear. We obtained six OA datasets from the GEO database, using four as training sets and two as validation sets. Differential expression analysis was employed to identify DR-DEGs, and unique molecular subtypes of OA were constructed based on these DR-DEGs. Subsequently, the immune microenvironment of OA patients was comprehensively analyzed using the “CIBERSORT” algorithm for immune infiltration. Various machine learning algorithms were utilized to screen characteristic DR-DEGs, and nomogram models and ROC curves were built based on these genes. The scRNA dataset (GSE169454) was used to classify chondrocytes in OA samples into distinct cell types, further exploring the gene distribution and correlation of characteristic DR-DEGs with specific cell subpopulations. Moreover, the expression levels of four characteristic DR-DEGs were validated through OA cell models and rat models. In our study, we identified 10 DR-DEGs with significant differences in expression within OA samples. Based on these DR-DEGs, two distinct molecular subtypes were recognized (cluster 1 and 2). ZNF484 and NDUFS1 were found to be significantly overexpressed in subtype 1, while the infiltration abundance of activated mast cells was markedly elevated in subtype 2. Moreover, significant differences were observed in the infiltration proportions of 11 immune cell types between OA and control samples, with 9 DR-DEGs demonstrating substantial correlations with immune cell infiltration levels. Further analysis of the scRNA dataset revealed that SLC3A2 and NDUFC1 were predominantly expressed in the preHTC subpopulation. All 10 DR-DEGs exhibited notably higher expression in the EC subpopulation across various cell types. The proportion of EC subgroups with high SLC3A2 expression increased, mainly enriching pathways related to inflammation, such as the IL-17 signaling pathway and TGF-beta signaling pathway. Using machine learning, we identified four characteristic DR-DEGs, which, in combination with the nomogram and ROC models, demonstrated promising performance in the diagnosis of OA. Additionally, in vivo validation confirmed a significant elevation of PPM1F expression in OA models. This study identified DR-DEGs as potential biomarkers for the diagnosis and classification of OA and provided a preliminary understanding of their role in the immune microenvironment. However, further experimental and clinical studies are required to validate their diagnostic value and therapeutic potential."

Heart disease remains a leading cause of death in developed countries, often leading to consequential outcomes such as dementia, which can be mitigated through early detection and treatment of cardiovascular issues. Continued research into preventing strokes and heart attacks is crucial. Utilizing the wealth of healthcare data related to cardiac ailments, a two-stage medical data classification and prediction model is proposed in this study. Initially, Binary Grey Wolf Optimization (BGWO) is used to cluster features, with the grouped information then utilized as input for the prediction model. An innovative 6-layered deep convolutional neural network (6LDCNNet) is designed for the classification of cardiac conditions. Hyper-parameter tuning for 6LDCNNet is achieved through an improved optimization method. The resulting model demonstrates promising performance on both the Cleveland dataset, achieving a convergence of 96% for assessing severity, and the echocardiography imaging dataset, with an impressive 98% convergence. This approach has the potential to aid physicians in diagnosing the severity of cardiac diseases, facilitating early interventions that can significantly reduce mortality associated with cardiovascular conditions."

The primary contribution of this study is the introduction of a multimodal fuzzy logic system-based gait index (FLS-GIS), designed to provide numerical scores for gait patterns in both healthy children and those with CP, before and after surgery. This study examines and evaluates the surgical outcomes in children with CP who have undergone Achilles tendon lengthening. The FLS-GIS utilizes hierarchical feature fusion and fuzzy logic models to systematically evaluate and score gait patterns, focusing on spatial and temporal features across the hip, knee, and ankle joints. The two FLS types-1 (FLS-GIS-T1) and type-2 (FLS-GIS-T2) indices, respectively, were implemented to comprehensively study gait profiles. Starting with the gait parameters of all subjects, the changes in gait parameters in post-surgery children reflect significant improvements in gait dynamics, bringing walking patterns in CP children closer to those of their typically healthy peers. Both FLS-GIS-T1 and FLS-GIS-T2 demonstrated significant improvements in post-surgery evaluations compared to pre-surgery assessments, with p values < 0.05 and < 0.001, respectively, when compared to traditional indices. The proposed FLS-based index offers clinicians a robust and standardized gait evaluation tool, characterized by a fixed range of values, enabling consistent assessment across various gait conditions."

Here we show that ErbB3 binding protein 1 (EBP1)/proliferation-associated 2G4 (PA2G4) interacts with presenilin, a catalytic subunit of γ-secretase, inhibiting Aβ production. Mice lacking forebrain Ebp1/Pa2g4 recapitulate the representative phenotypes of late-onset sporadic AD, displaying an age-dependent increase in Aβ deposition, amyloid plaques and cognitive dysfunction. In postmortem brains of patients with AD and 5x-FAD mice, we found that EBP1 is proteolytically cleaved by asparagine endopeptidase at N84 and N204 residues, compromising its inhibitory effect on γ-secretase, increasing Aβ aggregation and neurodegeneration. Accordingly, injection of AAV2-Ebp1 wild-type or an asparagine endopeptidase-uncleavable mutant into the brains of 5x-FAD mice decreased Aβ generation and alleviated the behavioral impairments. Thus, our study suggests that EBP1 acts as an inhibitor of γ-secretase on amyloid precursor protein cleavage and preservation of functional EBP1 could be a therapeutic strategy for AD."

To assist local Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in promptly formulate effective prevention and control measures, this study leveraged time-series data on brucellosis cases from February 2010 to September 2023 in Ili Kazak Autonomous Prefecture. Three distinct predictive modeling techniques—Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks—were employed for long-term forecasting. Further, the optimal model will be used to explore the impact of COVID-19 on the transmission of Human brucellosis in the region. We constructed a SARIMA(4,1,1)(3,1,2)12 model, an XGBoost model with a time lag of 22, and an LSTM model featuring 3 LSTM layers and 100 neurons in the fully connected layer to predict monthly reported cases from January 2021 to September 2023. The results indicated that the occurrence of brucellosis exhibits pronounced seasonal patterns, with higher incidence during summer and autumn, peaking in June annually. Performance evaluations revealed low Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE) for all three models. Specifically, the coefficient of determination (R2) was 0.6177 for the SARIMA model, 0.8033 for the XGBoost model, and 0.6523 for the LSTM model. The study found that the XGBoost model outperformed the other two in long-term forecasting of brucellosis, demonstrating higher predictive accuracy. This discovery can aid public health departments in advancing the deployment of prevention and control resources, particularly during peak seasons of brucellosis. It was also found that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the transmission of human brucellosis in the region was minimal. This research not only provides a reliable predictive tool but also offers a scientific basis for formulating early prevention and control strategies, potentially reducing the spread of this disease."

To develop and evaluate a deep learning-based algorithm that could accurately accomplish acne lesion detection and severity grading simultaneously in different healthcare scenarios. We collected 2,157 facial images from two public and three self-built datasets for model development and evaluation. An algorithm called AcneDGNet was constructed with a feature extraction module, a lesion detection module and a severity grading module. Its performance was evaluated in both online and offline healthcare scenarios. Experimental results on the largest and most diverse evaluation datasets revealed that the overall performance for acne severity grading achieved accuracies of 89.5% in online scenarios and 89.8% in offline scenarios. For follow-up visits in online scenarios, the accuracy for detecting the changing trends reached 87.8%, with a total counting error of 1.91 ± 3.28 for all acne lesions. Additionally, the prospective evaluation demonstrated that AcneDGNet was not only much more accurate for acne grading than junior dermatologists but also comparable to the accuracy of senior dermatologists. These findings indicated that AcneDGNet can effectively assist dermatologists and patients in the diagnosis and management of acne, both in online and offline healthcare scenarios."

        "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is being increasingly applied in healthcare to improve patient care and clinical outcomes. We previously developed an AI model using ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision) codes with other clinical variables to predict in-hospital mortality among trauma patients from a nationwide database. This study aimed to externally validate the performance of the AI model. Validation was conducted using a multicenter retrospective cohort study design, analyzing patient data from January 2020 to December 2021. The study included trauma patients based on specific ICD-10 codes, with other clinical variables. The performance of the AI model was evaluated against conventional metrics, including the ISS, and the ICISS (ICD-based ISS), using sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, balanced accuracy, precision, F1-score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) analyses. Data from 4,439 patients were analyzed. The AI model demonstrated high overall performance, achieving an AUROC of 0.9448 and a balanced accuracy of 85.08%, thereby outperforming traditional scoring systems such as ISS, or ICISS. Furthermore, the model accurately predicted mortality across datasets from each hospital (AUROCs of 0.9234 and 0.9653, respectively) despite significant differences in hospital characteristics. In the subset of patients with ISS < 9, the model showed a robust AUROC of 0.9043, indicating its effectiveness in predicting mortality, even in cases with lower-severity injuries. For patients with ISSs ≥ 9, the model maintained high sensitivity (93.60%) and balanced accuracy (77.08%), proving its reliability in more severe injury cases. External validation demonstrated the AI model’s high predictive accuracy and reliability in assessing in-hospital mortality risk among trauma patients across different injury severities and heterogeneous cohorts. These findings support the model’s potential integration into emergency departments and offer a significant tool for enhancing patient triage and treatment protocols."

        "abstract": "Objective Endometrial lesions are a frequent complication following breast cancer, and current diagnostic tools have limitations. This study aims to develop a machine learning-based nomogram model for predicting the early detection of endometrial lesions in patients. The model is designed to assess risk and facilitate individualized treatment strategies for premenopausal breast cancer patients. Method A retrospective study was conducted on 224 patients who underwent diagnostic curettage post-tamoxifen (TAM) therapy between November 2012 and November 2023. These patients exhibited signs of endometrial abnormalities or symptoms such as colporrhagia. Clinical data were collected and analyzed using R software (version 4.3.2) to identify factors influencing the occurrence of endometrial lesions and evaluate their predictive values. Three machine learning methods were employed to develop a risk prediction model, and their performances were compared. The best-performing model was selected to construct a nomogram of endometrial lesions. Internal validation was conducted using the bootstrap method, and the model’s accuracy and fit were assessed using the concordance index (C-index) and calibration curves. Results Independent risk factors for endometrial lesions included ultrasound characteristics, duration of TAM therapy, presence of colporrhagia, and endometrial thickness (P < 0.05). Among the machine learning methods compared, the LASSO regression integrated with a multifactorial logistic regression model demonstrated strong performance, with a concordance index (C-index) of 0.874 and effective calibration (mean absolute error of conformity: 0.014). This model achieved an accuracy of 0.853 and a precision of 0.917, with a training set AUC of 0.874 (95% CI: 0.794–0.831) and a test set AUC of 0.891 (95% CI: 0.777-1.000), closely aligning the predicted risk with the actual observed risk. Conclusion The developed prediction model is effective in evaluating endometrial lesions in premenopausal breast cancer patients. This model offers a theoretical foundation for improving clinical predictions and devising tailored treatment strategies for this patient group."

The goal was to enhance early sepsis screening by integrating comprehensive triage information beyond vital signs. This retrospective cohort study utilized data from the MIMIC-IV database. Two models were developed: Model 1 based on vital signs alone, and Model 2 incorporating vital signs, demographic characteristics, medical history, and chief complaints. Eight ML algorithms were employed, and model performance was evaluated using metrics such as AUC, F1 Score, and calibration curves. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) methods were used to enhance model interpretability. The study included 189,617 patients, with 5.95% diagnosed with sepsis. Model 2 consistently outperformed Model 1 across most algorithms. In Model 2, Gradient Boosting achieved the highest AUC of 0.83, followed by Extra Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (all 0.82). The SHAP method provided more comprehensible explanations for the Gradient Boosting algorithm. Modeling with comprehensive triage information using sEMR and ML methods was more effective in predicting sepsis at triage compared to using vital signs alone. Interpretable ML enhanced model transparency and provided sepsis prediction probabilities, offering a feasible approach for early sepsis screening and aiding healthcare professionals in making informed decisions during the triage process."

        "abstract": "Diabetes is a long-term condition characterized by elevated blood sugar levels. It can lead to a variety of complex disorders such as stroke, renal failure, and heart attack. Diabetes requires the most machine learning help to diagnose diabetes illness at an early stage, as it cannot be treated and adds significant complications to our health-care system. The diabetes PIMA Indian dataset (PIDD) was used for classification in several studies, it includes 768 instances and 9 features; eight of the features are the predictors, and one feature is the target. Firstly, we performed the preprocessing stage that includes mean imputation and data normalization. Afterwards, we trained the extracted features using various types of Machine Learning (ML); Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), K-Nearest neighbor (KNN), Naïve Bayes (NB), Histogram Gradient Boost (HGB), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) models. To achieve the classification for the PIDD, a new model called Recursive Feature Elimination-GRU (RFE-GRU) is proposed in this paper. RFE is vital for selecting features in the training dataset that are most important in predicting the target variable. While the GRU handles the challenge of vanishing and inflating gradient of the features results from RFE. Several predictive evaluation metrics, including precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy, and Area Under the Curve (AUC) achieved 90.50%, 90.70%, 90.50%, 90.70%, 0.9278, respectively, to verify and validate the execution of the RFE-GRU model. The comparative results showed that the RFE-GRU model is better than other classification models."

        "abstract": "Kawasaki disease (KD) is a leading cause of acquired heart disease in children, often resulting in coronary artery complications such as dilation, aneurysms, and stenosis. While intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is effective in reducing immunologic inflammation, 10–15% of patients do not respond to initial therapy, and some show resistance even after two consecutive treatments. Predicting which patients will not respond to these two IVIG treatments is crucial for guiding treatment strategies and improving outcomes. This study aimed to forecast resistance to two consecutive IVIG treatments using advanced machine learning models based on clinical and laboratory data. Data from the 9th National Kawasaki Disease Patient Survey by the Korean Kawasaki Disease Society encompassing 15,378 patients (mean age 33.0 ± 24.8 months; sex ratio 1.4:1) were used. Clinical and laboratory findings included white blood cell count, absolute neutrophil count (ANC), platelet count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serum protein, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, total bilirubin, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, and presence of pyuria. Machine learning models, including Logistic Regression (LR), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Random Forest (RF), CATBoost, Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM), and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), were applied to predict treatment resistance. The machine learning models achieved Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) values between 0.664 and 0.791, with the GBM model exhibiting the highest AUROC of 0.791. Analysis of feature importance revealed that ANC, serum protein, platelet count, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were the most significant predictors of treatment resistance. The cutoff values for these predictors were 7,860/mm³ for ANC, 7.0 g/dL for serum protein, 519,000/mm³ for platelet count, and 10.4 mg/dL for CRP. Among the patients, 12.2% were refractory to the first IVIG infusion, and 2.8% did not respond to the second IVIG treatment. Additionally, 13.1% of these patients had confirmed coronary artery dilatation (CAD) in the acute phase, and 4.7% developed CAD after the acute phase. Machine learning models effectively predict resistance to consecutive IVIG treatments, allowing for early identification of high-risk patients. Key predictors include ANC, serum protein, platelet count, and CRP levels. These findings can guide personalized treatment strategies and improve outcomes for Kawasaki Disease."

To address this, we developed and evaluated SCORPIO, a machine learning system that utilizes routine blood tests (complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic profile) alongside clinical characteristics from 9,745 ICI-treated patients across 21 cancer types. SCORPIO was trained on data from 1,628 patients across 17 cancer types from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. In two internal test sets comprising 2,511 patients across 19 cancer types, SCORPIO achieved median time-dependent area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC(t)) values of 0.763 and 0.759 for predicting overall survival at 6, 12, 18, 24 and 30 months, outperforming tumor mutational burden (TMB), which showed median AUC(t) values of 0.503 and 0.543. Additionally, SCORPIO demonstrated superior predictive performance for predicting clinical benefit (tumor response or prolonged stability), with AUC values of 0.714 and 0.641, compared to TMB (AUC = 0.546 and 0.573). External validation was performed using 10 global phase 3 trials (4,447 patients across 6 cancer types) and a real-world cohort from the Mount Sinai Health System (1,159 patients across 18 cancer types). In these external cohorts, SCORPIO maintained robust performance in predicting ICI outcomes, surpassing programmed death-ligand 1 immunostaining. These findings underscore SCORPIO’s reliability and adaptability, highlighting its potential to predict patient outcomes with ICI therapy across diverse cancer types and healthcare settings."

To date there is no automated clinically validated cough monitor that can be routinely used in clinical care and research. Here we describe the validation of such an automated cough monitor. Methods: This multicenter observational study compared the results of the Hyfe CoughMonitor wrist-worn device with manually counted coughs in subjects with a variety of etiologies as they went about their usual daily activities. We collected 24 h of continuous sounds from subjects while they simultaneously wore a CoughMonitor and an audio recorder. Coughs were labelled by multiple trained annotators who listened to the continuous audio recordings using validated methodology. The time stamps of these human-detected coughs were compared to those of the CoughMonitor to determine the system’s overall performance using event-to-event and hourly rate correlation analyses. Results: Over the 546 h monitored, 4,454 cough events were recorded; The overall sensitivity was 90.4% (95% CI of 88.3–92.2%). The overall false positive rate was 1.03 false positives per hour (95% CI of 0.84 to 1.24). The overall correlation between manual and CoughMonitor measured hourly coughing was high (Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.99). Two case studies of long-term monitoring of patients with chronic cough are presented. Conclusion: The present analysis of cough events demonstrated that the Hyfe CoughMonitor accurately reflects them with a high sensitivity and a low false positive rate. Future studies should focus on its potential role in the management of patients with cough in clinical practice."

However, little is known about diet-pattern-specific metagenomic profiles across populations. Here we considered 21,561 individuals spanning 5 independent, multinational, human cohorts to map how differences in diet pattern (omnivore, vegetarian and vegan) are reflected in gut microbiomes. Microbial profiles distinguished these common diet patterns well (mean AUC = 0.85). Red meat was a strong driver of omnivore microbiomes, with corresponding signature microbes (for example, Ruminococcus torques, Bilophila wadsworthia and Alistipes putredinis) negatively correlated with host cardiometabolic health. Conversely, vegan signature microbes were correlated with favourable cardiometabolic markers and were enriched in omnivores consuming more plant-based foods. Diet-specific gut microbes partially overlapped with food microbiomes, especially with dairy microbes, for example, Streptococcus thermophilus, and typical soil microbes in vegans. The signatures of common western diet patterns can support future nutritional interventions and epidemiology."

This study aims to develop an effective nomogram model to predict the 7-day, 15-day, and 30-day survival probabilities of septic patients with heart failure in the intensive care unit (ICU). This study extracted the pertinent clinical data of septic patients with heart failure from the Critical Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) database. Patients were then randomly allocated into a training set and a test set at a ratio of 7:3. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to determine independent risk factors influencing patient prognosis and to develop a nomogram model. The model’s efficacy and clinical significance were assessed through metrics such as the concordance index (C-index), time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC), calibration curve, and decision curve analysis (DCA). A total of 5,490 septic patients with heart failure were included in the study. A nomogram model was developed to predict short-term survival probabilities, using 13 variables: age, pneumonia, endotracheal intubation, mechanical ventilation, potassium (K), anion gap (AG), lactate (Lac), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), white blood cell count (WBC), red cell distribution width (RDW), hemoglobin-to-red cell distribution width ratio (HRR), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). The C-index was 0.730 (95% CI 0.719–0.742) for the training set and 0.761 (95% CI 0.745–0.776) for the test set, indicating strong model accuracy, indicating good model accuracy. Evaluations via the ROC curve, calibration curve, and decision curve analyses further confirmed the model’s reliability and utility. This study effectively developed a straightforward and efficient nomogram model to predict the 7-day, 15-day, and 30-day survival probabilities of septic patients with heart failure in the ICU.

Although restrictive eligibility criteria contribute to this issue, the role of selection bias related to prognostic risk remains unclear. In this study, we developed TrialTranslator, a framework designed to systematically evaluate the generalizability of RCTs for oncology therapies. Using a nationwide database of electronic health records from Flatiron Health, this framework emulates RCTs across three prognostic phenotypes identified through machine learning models. We applied this approach to 11 landmark RCTs that investigated anti-cancer regimens considered standard of care for the four most prevalent advanced solid malignancies. Our analyses reveal that patients in low-risk and medium-risk phenotypes exhibit survival times and treatment-associated survival benefits similar to those observed in RCTs. In contrast, high-risk phenotypes show significantly lower survival times and treatment-associated survival benefits compared to RCTs. Our results were corroborated by a comprehensive robustness assessment, including examinations of specific patient subgroups, holdout validation and semi-synthetic data simulation. These findings suggest that the prognostic heterogeneity among real-world oncology patients plays a substantial role in the limited generalizability of RCT results. Machine learning frameworks may facilitate individual patient-level decision support and estimation of real-world treatment benefits to guide trial design."

This study investigated condylar resorption in a cohort of 200 patients This allowed for a powerful update on incidence and risk factors. 9.5% of patients developed resorption. These patients had on average, 17% volume loss with 3.9 mm ramal height loss and 3.1 mm posterior mandibular displacement. 2% of patients had bilateral resorption. Univariable analysis identified a younger age, a bimaxillary + genioplasty procedure, larger mandibular advancements, upward movements of the distal segment, a higher counterclockwise pitch of the distal segment, smaller preoperative condylar volumes and a higher anterior/posterior lower facial height ratio as risk factors on a patient level. Univariable analysis on a condylar level also identified compressive movements of the ramus and a higher mandibular plane angle as risk factors. Using machine learning for the multivariable analysis, the amount of mandibular advancement was the most important predictor for condylar resorption. There were no differences in preoperative mandibular, ramal or condylar shape between patients with or without resorption. These findings suggest condylar resorption may be more common than thought. Identifying risk factors allows surgical plans to be adjusted to reduce the likelihood of resorption, and patients can be more selectively screened postoperatively."

This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of a low-code approach for assisting clinicians with data mining for mortality and length of stay (LOS) prediction in patients with CAP. A retrospective study was conducted using a low-code platform and the PyCaret library in Google Colab on data from patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) admitted between January 2013 and December 2021 to two medical facilities. Model performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for mortality prediction and the R2 score for LOS prediction, with benchmarks set at AUC > 0.9 and R2 > 0.5. The Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) method was used for interpreting individual predictions. A total of 669 CAP patients were enrolled in the analysis.Fifteen models were evaluated for mortality prediction, and nineteen models were evaluated for LOS prediction utilizing the PyCaret library. The Light Gradient Boosting Machine model yielded the highest AUC (0.963) for mortality prediction. In predicting LOS, the Extratrees Regressor model achieved the highest R2 score of 0.585. Factors such as the severity of pneumonia and the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) were significant factors influencing mortality. For the LOS, the CCI score, activities of daily living, and social support were significant predictors. The low-code approach enables medical professionals with limited technical expertise to effectively employ data science in their clinical decision-making process. This approach proved to be a valuable tool in the analysis of CAP patient data."

        "abstract": "A dual-stage model for classifying Parkinson’s disease severity, through a detailed analysis of Gait signals using force sensors and machine learning approaches, is proposed in this study. Parkinson’s disease is the primary neurodegenerative disorder that results in a gradual reduction in motor function. Early detection and monitoring of the disease progression is highly challenging due to the gradual progression of symptoms and the inadequacy of conventional methods in identifying subtle changes in mobility. The proposed dual-stage model utilized a hypertuned Random Forest Tree (RFT) to classify the subjects into PD and non-PD classes at Stage 1 and a hypertuned Ensemble Regressor (ER) to predict the severity of illness at Stage 2. Further, we have implemented the proposed model on the data signals gathered from both feet of 166 participants using Vertical Ground Reaction Force Sensors (VGRF). The dataset comprised 93 persons with Parkinson’s disease and 73 healthy controls. The dataset (imbalance) collected from both feet is passed to the preprocessing phase (for balancing data using the SMOTE method), followed by the feature extraction phase to extract features related to time, frequency, spatial, and temporal features domains that are highly effective for detecting and assigning severity levels of PD. A Recursive Feature Elimination method is also used to select the optimal set of features to improve the model performance. It is acknowledged that the early detection of Parkinson’s disease is contingent upon critical parameters, including stride length, stance duration, swing interval, double limb support, step time, and step length. The crucial evaluation metrics used for evaluating model performance include accuracy, mean absolute error, and root mean square error. The findings indicate that the suggested model significantly surpasses current methodologies. It attained an accuracy of 97.5 ± 2.1%, Sensitivity of 97% ± 2.5%, and average Specificity of 95% ± 2.2% in differentiating between PD and non-PD participants utilizing RFT and evaluated disease severity with an average accuracy of 96.4 ± 2.3%, an average mean absolute error of 0.065 ± 0.024, and a root mean square error of 0.080 ± 0.06. The results indicate that the proposed dual-stage model is exceptionally successful in the early detection and severity assessment of Parkinson’s disease and demonstrates better efficacy than alternative models."

We identify three immunologically distinct clusters, with one group characterized by increased immune activity and poorer prognosis, indicating potential benefit from immunotherapies. We develop a radiomic signature that predicts these immune profiles with over 80% accuracy. Furthermore, our clinicoradiomic model predicts progression-free survival and correlates with treatment response. We also identify genetic variants and transcriptomic pathways associated with progression risk, highlighting links to tumor growth and immune response.

There was a strong association between RPS and ethnicity, however, there was substantial overlap between each ethnicity and the respective distributions of RPS scores. RPS decouples traditional demographic variables from clinical imaging characteristics. RPS may serve as a useful metric to quantify the diversity of the training, validation, and testing datasets used in the development of AI algorithms to ensure adequate inclusion and explainability of the model performance, critical in evaluating all currently deployed AI models. The code to derive RPS is publicly available at: https://github.com/uw-biomedical-ml/retinal-pigmentation-score."

        "abstract": "Deep learning analysis of electrocardiography (ECG) may predict cardiovascular outcomes. We present a novel multi-task deep learning model, the ECG-MACE, which predicts the one-year first-ever major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) using 2,821,889 standard 12-lead ECGs, including training (n = 984,895), validation (n = 422,061), and test (n = 1,414,933) sets, from Chang Gung Memorial Hospital database in Taiwan. Data from another independent medical center (n = 113,224) was retrieved for external validation. The model’s performance achieves AUROCs of 0.90 for heart failure (HF), 0.85 for myocardial infarction (MI), 0.76 for ischemic stroke (IS), and 0.89 for mortality. Furthermore, it outperforms the Framingham risk score at 5-year MACEs and 10-year mortality prediction. Over 10-year follow-ups, the model-predicted-positive group exhibits significantly higher MACE incidences than the model-predicted-negative group (relative incidence ratio: HF: 15.28; MI: 7.87; IS: 4.74; mortality: 13.18). Using solely ECGs, ECG-MACE effectively predicts one-year events and exhibits long-term anticipation. It provides potential applications in preventive medicine."

        "abstract": "As one of the most destructive and invasive cancers, pancreatic cancer exhibits complex tumor heterogeneity, which has been a major challenge for clinicians in terms of patient treatment and prognosis. The toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway is closely related to the immune microenvironment within various cancer tissues. To explore the development pattern of pancreatic cancer and find an ideal biomarker, our research has explored the mechanism of the TLR pathway in pancreatic cancer. We collected single-cell expression data from 57,024 cells and transcriptomic data from 945 pancreatic cancer patients, and conducted a series of analyses at both the single-cell and transcriptomic levels. By calculating the TLR pathway score, we clustered pancreatic cancer patients and conducted a series of analyses including metabolic pathways, immune microenvironment, drug sensitivity and so on. In the process of building prognostic models, we screened 33 core genes related to the prognosis of pancreatic cancer, and combined a series of machine learning algorithms to build the prognosis model of pancreatic cancer. We used single cell sequencing to clarify the complex intrinsic relationship between TLR pathway and pancreatic cancer. The strongest TLR signals were observed in macrophages and endothelial cells. With the occurrence of pancreatic cancer, the TLR signal of various cell types gradually increased, but with the increase of the malignant degree of ductal epithelial cells, the TLR signal gradually weakened. Cluster analysis showed that patients with the most active TLR pathway had severe dysregulation of immune microenvironment and the worst prognosis. Finally, we combined a series of machine learning algorithms to build a pancreatic cancer prognosis model that includes four genes (NT5E, TGFBI, ANLN, and FAM83A). The model showed strong performance in predicting the survival state of pancreatic cancer samples. We explored the important role of TLR pathway in pancreatic cancer and established and validated a new prognosis model for pancreatic cancer based on TLR-related genes."

This study aims to use transcriptomics and explore common diagnostic genes of osteoporosis and sarcopenia and predict potentially effective treatment drugs. Three datasets for osteoporosis and sarcopenia were downloaded from the GEO database, and transcriptome sequencing was performed on clinical samples. A total of 23 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were selected using the LIMMA, WGCNA, and the DEseq2 package. Three machine learning methods were employed to determine the final common diagnostic genes for the diseases. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate the predictive performance of genes. Single-gene enrichment analysis (GSEA), immune infiltration abundance calculation, and related metabolic analysis were used to study the pathogenesis of the two diseases. Finally, the CMap database was used to predict potential therapeutic drugs for the diseases, and further validation was conducted through RT-PCR and WB. Three genes for the diseases CHST3, PGBD5, and SLIT2 were identified, showing good predictive performance in both internal and external validations. GSEA analysis revealed that genes were enriched primarily in pathways related to cell cycle regulation, fatty acid metabolism, DNA replication, and carbohydrate synthesis. CHST3 and SLIT2 were involved in the immune response, but PGBD5 seemed unrelated to the immune response. Potential therapeutic drugs were predicted, and the RT-PCR, WB results further validated our hypotheses. CHST3, PGBD5, and SLIT2 can serve as potential genes for the diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis and sarcopenia; furthermore, these results provide new clues for further experimental research and treatment."

Training data were created under the supervision of gastrointestinal surgeons. Test images and videos were randomly sampled and model performance was evaluated visually by 10 external gastrointestinal surgeons. The mean Dice coefficient of the 50 images was 0.46. The AI model could detect at least 75% of the loose connective tissue in 91.8% of the images (459/500 responses). False positives were found for 52.6% of the images, but most were not judged significant enough to affect surgical judgment. When comparing the surgeon’s annotation with the AI prediction image, 5 surgeons judged the AI image was closer to their own recognition. When viewing the AI video and raw video side-by-side, surgeons judged that in 99% of the AI videos, visualization was improved and stress levels were acceptable when viewing the AI prediction display. The AI model developed demonstrated performance at a level approaching that of a gastrointestinal surgeon. Such visualization of a safe dissectable layer may help to reduce intraoperative recognition errors and surgical complications."

Patellae height ratios were measured using the Insall-Salvati ratio and the Caton-Deschamps index. The patella height ratios of the sample population were plotted on a quantile plot and diagnosed as patella alta, baja or normal using the original ratio definitions. The study population patella height values at the 95th, 98th and 5th centiles were identified and compared to those described as alta or baja by Insall-Salvati and Caton-Deschamps. This meant that if the patient had patella alta, this would be defined as a ratio of ≥ 1.2 and hypothesised that this would align at the 98th centile of the study population, whilst if diagnosed as patella baja (≤ 0.74), this should align at the 5th centile of the population. The inter-rater reliability of both ratios was calculated using kappa statistics. Two authors made all calculations and compared them for consistency using the intraclass correlation coefficient. For the Insall-Salvati ratio, the study population’s value at the 98th centile was equivalent to what Insall-Salvati describes as alta, a ratio of ≥ 1.2. In the study population, patients are overdiagnosed if using the Insall-Salvati ratio as patella baja ≤ 0.74, as the value at the 5th centile in the study population was 0.59. Using the Caton-Deschamps index, the 95th centile was 1.3, higher than the patella alta ratio determined by Caton as a ratio ≥ 1.2. Using Caton-Deschamps, patients are being underdiagnosed if utilising a patella baja ratio of ≤ 0.6. In our population, the 5th centile was 0.75. The two ratios had a kappa coefficient of 0.01, which indicates poor inter-rater reliability. Depending on the ratio used, caton-Deschamps and Insall-Salvati ratios diagnose patients as alta or baja differently. The current patella height ratios have originated from very small, select population samples. The future of patella height discussion should begin with data representing large populations. Then, we can discuss the upper and lower limits of abnormality."

        "abstract": "Worldwide, anemia in under-five children is a serious public health problem that causes significant morbidity and mortality. It also negatively impacts children’s physical growth, focus, memory, and academic performance. Despite this, there is a paucity of up-to-date information on the spatial distribution and determinants of under-five anemia in Mozambique. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the spatial variation and determinates of anemia among under-five children in Mozambique by using the most recent demographic and health survey data. A cross-sectional study was conducted using the most recent demographic and health survey data of Mozambique. A total weighted sample of 3127 under-five children was included in the study. Spatial SaTScan statistics were done using Kuldroff’s SaTScan version 9.6 software. ArcGIS version 10.7 software is used to visualize the spatial distribution of under-five anemia. A multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression analysis was employed to identify the determinants of under-five anemia. The level of statistical significance was declared at a p-value of < 0.05. Overall, the prevalence of anemia among under-five children in Mozambique was 49.46% (95% CI 47.70–51.21). Under-five anemia was not evenly distributed across the country; a higher distribution was observed in Zambezia, Nampula, Safala, and the southern part of Gaza; fewer cold spots were observed in the western and southern parts of Niassa, the eastern part of Tete, the western part of Manica, and Maputo City. In spatial scan statistics, children in the most likely cluster were 1.58 times more likely to be anemic than those living outside the window (RR = 1.58, P-value < 0.001). Children with fathers with no formal education, children from anemic mothers, children whose mothers are underweight, children residing in the Zambzia region, children residing in the Nampula region, and children residing in the Niassa region were significantly associated with under-five anemia in Mozambique. The burden of under-five anemia in Mozambique is higher and distributed non-randomly across regions. Maternal anemia, underweighted mothers, husband education, and regions in Mozambique were found to be significant determinants of anemia in under-five children. Improving the nutritional status of mothers and interventions to address maternal anemia, with special attention to the Nampula and Zambzia regions, are recommended to reduce under-five anemia in Mozambique."

Patients who underwent implant placement surgeries using the robotic system under a standard operation procedure were recruited. Deviations of dental implants were calculated after superimposition of the preoperative and postoperative cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images. The possible effects of the implant regions on these deviations were investigated. A total of 30 participants were enrolled in the study and 44 implants were inserted. The median (25th-75th percentile) global coronal deviation, global apical deviation, and angular deviation were 0.62 mm (0.46–1.00), 0.62 mm (0.49–1.01) and 1.16 (0.69–1.69) °, respectively. The jaw was a factor in the lateral coronal, vertical coronal, and vertical apical deviations (P < 0.05). Both the lateral coronal and apical deviations were greater for immediate implant placements than for delayed implant placements (P < 0.05). The implant dimensions significantly affected the apical deviation (P < 0.05). These results indicate that rCAIS based on a standard operation procedure is safe and accurate in partially edentulous patients. However, there remains a need to optimize robotic systems to simplify the workflow and improve their ability to recognize and respond to complex bone structures. Further clinical studies should also focus on comparing the long-term implant success rate and related complications of rCAIS with traditional approaches."

Medication reconciliation is the most cost-effective intervention and can result in a 66% reduction in medication errors. To improve patient safety, we developed a machine learning-based tool that prioritizes patients at risk of medication errors upon admission to the hospital to ensure that they undergo medication reconciliation by clinical pharmacists. The data were collected from the electronic health records of patients admitted to Reims University Hospital who underwent medication reconciliation between 2017 and 2023. The data from 7200 patients were used to train four machine learning-based models based on 52 variables in the development dataset. These models were used to prioritize admitted patients according to their likelihood of being exposed to a medication error. Our models, particularly the voting classifier model, demonstrated good performance (a recall of 0.75, precision of 0.65, F1 score of 0.70, AUROC of 0.74 and AUCPR of 0.75). In a retrospective evaluation simulating real-life use, the voting classifier model successfully identified 45% of the total patients selected who were found to have at least one unintended discrepancy compared to 21% when using the existing tool. The positive experimental results of this tool showed a superior improvement of 113% over the existing tool by targeting patients at risk of medication errors upon admission to Reims University Hospital."

We assessed the performance of radiomics-based models in distinguishing primary there is from SCC presenting as lung nodules on Computed Tomography (CT) scans. We studied individuals with histopathologically proven adenocarcinoma or SCC type NSCLC tumours, detected as lung nodules on Chest CT. The workflow comprised manual nodule segmentation, regions of interest creation, preprocessing data, feature extraction, and nodule classification using machine learning algorithms. The dataset comprised 46 adenocarcinoma and 28 SCC cases. For feature extraction, 101 radiomic features were extracted from the tumour regions using the ‘pyradiomics’ module in Python. After extensive experimentation with various feature importance techniques, the top 10 most significant radiomic features for differentiating between adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) were identified. The Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique was used to achieve a balanced distribution. Lung nodules were classified using 13 machine-learning algorithms, including Linear Discriminant Analysis, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and eXtreme Gradient Boosting. The Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Classifier with Rectified Linear Unit (ReLu) activation was the most accurate (83% accuracy) with 83% precision and 86% sensitivity in distinguishing SCC from adenocarcinoma. It achieved a balanced F1 score of 83%, indicating well-rounded performance in both precision and sensitivity. The average Area Under the Curve score was 88%, representing good discrimination between the two classes of lung nodules. Radiomics is a powerful non-invasive tool that could potentially add to visual information obtained on CT. The MLP Classifier with ReLu activation showed good accuracy in distinguishing primary lung adenocarcinoma from SCC nodules. However, widespread multicentre trials are required to realize the full potential of radiomics in lung nodules."

Using a deep learning-based hybrid human-AI pipeline that cross-references PubMed, the Gene Expression Omnibus, DisGeNET, The Cancer Genome Atlas and the NIH Molecular Imaging and Contrast Agent Database, we bridge individual genes in human cancers with respective theranostic compounds. Cross-referencing the Theranostic Genome with RNAseq data from over 17’000 human tissues identifies theranostic targets and lead compounds for various human cancers, and allows tailoring targeted theranostics to relevant cancer subpopulations.

        "abstract": "Intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) is the most severe subtype of stroke, with a 2-year mortality of nearly 50% and the greatest rate of disability amongst stroke survivors. Whilst treatment options for ICH remain limited, the condition requires prompt identification and rapid intervention to reduce permanent brain damage, with diagnosis traditionally confirmed by CT imaging. Although imaging is excellent at determining the presence of an intracranial bleed, biomarkers may help to identify the type of stroke or when the stroke began. Kisspeptin is a neuropeptide best known for its functions in reproductive biology, but recent preclinical studies have demonstrated that kisspeptins are upregulated in rodent models of haemorrhagic stroke. Here we report for the first time that kisspeptin immunoreactivity is significantly higher in post-mortem human brain tissue after both ICH and ICH associated with cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Machine learning and artificial intelligence-enabled image analysis of multiplexed immunolabeled brain tissues demonstrated that kisspeptin immunoreactivity was higher in cells of the microvasculature (CD105+), but not in neurons or astrocytes when compared to controls. Further spatial analysis indicated that kisspeptin immunoreactivity was concentrated to the region of haemorrhage. These results indicate that following ICH, kisspeptin is significantly higher in the human brain, suggesting expression from local vasculature or recruitment to the haematoma. Further work is required to determine the biological mechanisms underlying kisspeptin elevation within the ICH microenvironment and its potential utility as a novel biomarker or therapeutic target for ICH."

This study aimed to develop a predictive model leveraging deep neural networks to predict VC progression after OVCF using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and clinical data. Among 245 enrolled patients with acute OVCF, data from 200 patients were used for the development dataset, and data from 45 patients were used for the test dataset. To construct an accurate prediction model, we explored two backbone architectures: convolutional neural networks and vision transformers (ViTs), along with various pre-trained weights and fine-tuning methods. Through extensive experiments, we built our model by performing parameter-efficient fine-tuning of a ViT model pre-trained on a large-scale biomedical dataset. Attention rollouts indicated that the contours and internal features of the compressed vertebral body were critical in predicting VC with this model. To further improve the prediction performance of our model, we applied the augmented prediction strategy, which uses multiple MRI frames and achieves a significantly higher area under the curve (AUC). Our findings suggest that employing a biomedical foundation model fine-tuned using a parameter-efficient method, along with augmented prediction, can significantly enhance medical decisions."

This classification groups lesions into ten categories, primarily divided into hypovolumetric, hypervolumetric, and normovolumetric groups. To validate this system, 10 raters—comprising 5 general dentists and 5 oral radiology specialists—assessed the CBCT images and diagnosed the lesions using the Sivan classification. Eight raters repeated the process after one month to assess consistency. The overall agreement between raters, quantified using kappa statistics, was 0.82, indicating excellent consistency. Hypervolumetric and normovolumetric lesions demonstrated the highest agreement (kappa 0.84 and 0.82, respectively), while hypovolumetric lesions showed substantial agreement (kappa 0.77). Pairwise interrater agreement ranged from 76 to 93%, with kappa values between 0.75 and 0.87. Intrarater reliability was equally strong, with kappa values between 0.79 and 0.89.These results suggest that the Sivan classification provides a robust and reliable framework for diagnosing jaw lesions using CBCT volumetric analysis, surpassing traditional diagnostic methods in accuracy and consistency."

The use of a point-of-care tool for self-management of stress levels and mental health status is the natural trajectory towards creating solutions for one of the primary contributors to the global burden of disease. Notably, cortisol is the main stress hormone and a key logical indicator of hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis activity that governs the activation of the human stress system. Therefore, the measurement of cortisol is imperative to lead the discussion of the relationship between psychological stress and mental health deterioration. The aim of the current study was to determine salivary cortisol concentrations of healthy individuals undergoing the MAST protocol for human stress activation, through optical-colorimetric techniques. The study demonstrates the use of the blue tetrazolium (BT) method as successful means of rapid measurement of cortisol in saliva, comparable to the gold-standard technique i.e., enzyme-linked immunoassays (ELISA) with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.997. The results support the future development of a point-of-care optical sensor-based device and mobile application for cortisol monitoring and stress profiling in adults."

Using anonymized outpatient data from the electronic medical records of Maccabi Healthcare Services, we developed and evaluated five machine learning models to classify patients as at-risk for CD autoimmunity prior to first documented diagnosis or positive serum tissue transglutaminase (tTG-IgA). A train set of highly seropositive (tTG-IgA > 10X ULN) cases (n = 677) with likely CD and controls (n = 176,293) with no evidence of CD autoimmunity was used for model development. Input features included demographic information and commonly available laboratory results. The models were then evaluated for discriminative ability as measured by AUC on a distinct set of highly seropositive cases (n = 153) and controls (n = 41,087). The highest performing model was XGBoost (AUC = 0.86), followed by logistic regression (AUC = 0.85), random forest (AUC = 0.83), multilayer perceptron (AUC = 0.80) and decision tree (AUC = 0.77). Contributing features for the XGBoost model for classifying a patient as at-risk for undiagnosed CD autoimmunity included signs of anemia, transaminitis and decreased high-density lipoprotein. This model’s ability to distinguish cases of incident CD autoimmunity from controls shows promise as a potential clinical tool to identify patients with increased risk of having undiagnosed celiac disease in the community, for serologic screening."

Two oral surgeons (a specialist and a clinical resident) predicted the difficulty level of the test data. This study also aimed to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model in predicting the necessity for tooth separation or bone removal during wisdom tooth extraction. Two convolutional neural networks (AlexNet and VGG-16) were created and trained using panoramic X-ray images. Both surgeons interpreted the same images and classified them into three groups. The accuracies for humans were 54.4% for both surgeons, 57.7% for AlexNet, and 54.4% for VGG-16. These results indicate that accurately predict the difficulty of wisdom teeth extraction using panoramic radiographs alone is challenging. However, AlexNet and VGG-16 had sensitivities of more than 90% for crown and root separation. The predictive ability of our proposed model is equivalent to that of an oral surgery specialist, and a recall value > 90% makes it suitable for screening in clinical settings."

The CLDLR model demonstrates the highest diagnostic performance in predicting benign and malignant BI-RADS 4 lesions, with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.988 (95% confidence interval : 0.949, 0.985) in the training cohort and 0.888 (95% confidence interval : 0.829, 0.947) in the testing cohort.The CLDLR model outperformed the diagnoses made by the three radiologists in the initial assessment of the testing cohorts. By utilizing AI scores from the CLDLR model and heatmaps from the DLR model, the diagnostic performance of all radiologists was further enhanced in the testing cohorts. Our study presents a noninvasive imaging biomarker for the prediction of benign and malignant BI-RADS 4 lesions. By comparing the results from two rounds of assessment, our AI-assisted diagnostic tool demonstrates practical value for radiologists with varying levels of experience."

        "abstract": "Human activity recognition (HAR) is one of the most important segments of technology advancement in applications of smart devices, healthcare systems & fitness. HAR uses details from wearable sensors that capture the way human beings move or engage with their surrounding. Several researchers have thus presented different ways of modeling human motion, and some have been as follows: Many researchers have presented different methods of modeling human movements. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed the CNN BiLSTM model with undersampling to improve the recognition of human actions. The model is evaluated using state-of-the-art metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, on two publicly available datasets: For instance, the MHEALTH and Actitracker. This will enable the team to attain test accuracies of up to 98.5% on the MHEALTH dataset. The proposed CNN-BiLSTM model outperforms the conventional deep learning methods, as reported in the Actitracker dataset, by about 5% improvement. HAR has many applications, one of which is used to keep vigil over elderly people who live alone to alert when one has fallen or when any strange movement is noticed which could be a sign that the individual is experiencing a medical Emergency. It can also be applied in physiotherapy, where the patient’s development throughout rehabilitation exercises can be accessed."

        "abstract": "Surface electromyography (sEMG) data has been extensively utilized in deep learning algorithms for hand movement classification. This paper aims to introduce a novel method for hand gesture classification using sEMG data, addressing accuracy challenges seen in previous studies. We propose a U-Net architecture incorporating a MobileNetV2 encoder, enhanced by a novel Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) and metaheuristic optimization for spatial feature extraction in hand gesture and motion recognition. Bayesian optimization is employed as the metaheuristic approach to optimize the BiLSTM model’s architecture. To address the non-stationarity of sEMG signals, we employ a windowing strategy for signal augmentation within deep learning architectures. The MobileNetV2 encoder and U-Net architecture extract relevant features from sEMG spectrogram images. Edge computing integration is leveraged to further enhance innovation by enabling real-time processing and decision-making closer to the data source. Six standard databases were utilized, achieving an average accuracy of 90.23% with our proposed model, showcasing a 3–4% average accuracy improvement and a 10% variance reduction. Notably, Mendeley Data, BioPatRec DB3, and BioPatRec DB1 surpassed advanced models in their respective domains with classification accuracies of 88.71%, 90.2%, and 88.6%, respectively. Experimental results underscore the significant enhancement in generalizability and gesture recognition robustness. This approach offers a fresh perspective on prosthetic management and human-machine interaction, emphasizing its efficacy in improving accuracy and reducing variance for enhanced prosthetic control and interaction with machines through edge computing integration."

This study examined 27,623 participants aged 20–50 (mean: 40.7) years who underwent initial health screening at Kangbuk Samsung Hospital (2011–2019), focusing on individuals with one or two MetS components. Hierarchical agglomerative clustering was used to form MetS risk clusters based on initial and follow-up data, including age, resting heart rate (rHR), serum uric acid (UA), C-reactive protein (CRP), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, and ferritin levels, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), periodontal disease, and Helicobacter pylori infection duration. Kaplan–Meier and generalized additive models were used to present the restricted mean survival time (RMST) and identify onset contributors. Clusters with NAFLD and elevated UA levels had the highest MetS risk, whereas those with uniformly low biomarker levels revealed the lowest risk. During follow-up, a cluster initially comprising 60.2% moderate-risk patients exhibited high biomarker levels and had the worst MetS prognosis (RMST: 211 days). UA, CRP levels, and rHR contributed to the incidence of MetS in the fitted model. Machine learning can predict the premetabolic state at MetS risk in a population-based cohort."

EEG has become a widely utilized tool in emotion recognition due to its high temporal resolution, real-time monitoring capabilities, portability, and cost-effectiveness. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end emotion recognition method from EEG signals, called MSDCGTNet, which is based on the Multi-Scale Dynamic 1D CNN and the Gated Transformer. First, the Multi-Scale Dynamic CNN is used to extract complex spatial and spectral features from raw EEG signals, which not only avoids information loss but also reduces computational costs associated with the time-frequency conversion of signals. Then, the Gated Transformer Encoder is utilized to capture global dependencies of EEG signals. This encoder focuses on specific regions of the input sequence while reducing computational resources through parallel processing with the improved multi-head self-attention mechanisms. Third, the Temporal Convolution Network is used to extract temporal features from the EEG signals. Finally, the extracted abstract features are fed into a classification module for emotion recognition. The proposed method was evaluated on three publicly available datasets: DEAP, SEED, and SEED_IV. Experimental results demonstrate the high accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method for emotion recognition. This approach proves to be robust and suitable for various practical applications. By addressing challenges posed by existing methods, the proposed method provides a valuable and effective solution for the field of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)."

In this study, data from the Gene Expression Omnibus and disease target databases (OMIM, GeneCards, DisGeNet, TTD, and DrugBank) were integrated with ferroptosis-related gene datasets. To identify key molecular targets of Chuanxiong Rhizoma (CX), drug ingredient databases, including PubChem and TCMBank, were employed to map CX-related targets (CX-DEGs-FRG and CX-IS-FRG). Gene targets and relevant signaling pathways were analyzed using weighted gene co-expression network analysis, protein-protein interaction networks, Gene Ontology, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression and support vector machine methods were utilized to identify intersecting genes, and the predictive accuracy of core targets was evaluated through receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Immune cell infiltration in the IS microenvironment was assessed using CIBERSORT, followed by molecular docking of CX’s active components with key targets. The JAK-STAT3 pathway was identified as a critical regulatory mechanism, and five key targets (ALOX5, PTGS2, STAT3, G6PD, and HIF1A) emerged as central to the IS-induced ferroptosis. Elevated infiltration of CD8 + T cells and neutrophils was significantly correlated with IS. Notably, the active components mandenol and myricanone demonstrated strong binding affinities with these five targets, which validated the results from network-based analysis. In conclusion, the JAK-STAT3 pathway, through its regulation of ALOX5, PTGS2, STAT3, G6PD, and HIF1A, could play a crucial role in modulating ferroptosis and immune responses in IS. These findings suggest that CX could serve as a potential therapeutic approach for IS, targeting the regulation of IS-induced ferroptosis and the immune microenvironment."

Currently, we can only rely on the doctor’s subjective experience for identification, with low efficiency and large error. In this study, a deep learning method is introduced for the first time into the diagnosis of ligamentum flavum ossificans, we proposed a lightweight, automatic and efficient method for identifying ossified regions, called CDUNeXt. By designing lightweight module structures, utilizing large-kernel convolutions to extracts the long-distance dependencies of different features of the image, and adopting dual-cross-gate-attention(DCGA) to sequentially capture the channel and spatial dependencies so as to fast and accurate segmentation while maintaining fewer parameters and lower complexity. Experiments show that CDUNeXt achieves the best segmentation performance with an optimal balance of lighter weights and less computational cost compared to existing methods. This work fills the gap in the application of deep learning techniques in the diagnosis of ligamentum flavum ossificans, contributes to the realization of lightweight medical image segmentation networks and lays the foundation for subsequent research."

Blood CRP, TNFα, IL6, levels, and liver function and quality of life were measured. We found that CRP, TNFα, and IL6 were correlated in sweat and serum among both groups and were evaluated in inpatients versus outpatients/controls. IL6 is associated with lower transplant-free survival. Sweat monitoring nocturnal CRP/IL6 elevations in cirrhosis versus controls. Outpatients with cirrhosis had inflammation levels that elevated during the evening and peaked towards the early night periods. The levels start to fall much later at night and early morning.

        "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a complex disease of cartilage characterised by joint pain, functional limitation, and reduced quality of life with affected joint movement leading to pain and limited mobility. Current methods to diagnose OA are predominantly limited to X-ray, MRI and invasive joint fluid analysis, all of which lack chemical or molecular specificity and are limited to detection of the disease at later stages. A rapid minimally invasive and non-destructive approach to disease diagnosis is a critical unmet need. Label-free techniques such as Raman Spectroscopy (RS), Coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS), Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) and Two Photon Fluorescence (TPF) are increasingly being used to characterise cartilage tissue. However, current studies are based on whole tissue analysis and do not consider the different and structurally distinct layers in cartilage. In this work, we use Raman spectroscopy to obtain signatures from the superficial (top) and deep (bottom) layer of healthy and osteoarthritic cartilage samples from 64 patients (19 control and 45 OA). Spectra were acquired both in the ‘fingerprint’ region from 700 to 1720 cm− 1 and high-frequency stretching region from 2500 to 3300 cm− 1. Principal component and linear discriminant analysis was used to identify the peaks that contributed significantly to classification accuracy of the different samples. The most pronounced differences were observed at the proline (855 cm− 1 and 921 cm− 1) and hydroxyproline (877 cm− 1 and 938 cm− 1), sulphated glycosaminoglycan (sGAG) (1064 cm− 1 and 1380 cm− 1) frequencies for both control and OA as well as the 1245 cm− 1 and 1272 cm− 1, 1320 cm− 1 and 1345 cm− 1, 1451 cm− 1 collagen modes were altered in OA samples, consistent with expected collagen structural changes. Classification accuracy based on Raman fingerprint spectral analysis of superficial and deep layer cartilage for controls was found to be 97% and 93% on using individual/all spectra and, 100% and 95% on using mean spectra per patient, respectively. OA diseased cartilage was classified with an accuracy of 88% and 84% for individual/all spectra, and 96% and 95% for mean spectra per patient based on analysis of the superficial and the deep layers, respectively. Raman spectra from the C-H stretching region (2500–3300 cm− 1) resulted in high classification accuracy for identification of different layers and OA diseased cartilage but low accuracy for controls. Differential changes in superficial and deep layer cartilage signatures were observed with age (under 60 and over 60 years), in contrast, less significant differences were observed with gender. Prominent chemical changes in the different layers of cartilage were preliminarily imaged using CARS, SHG and TPF. Cell clustering was observed in OA together with differences in pericellular matrix and collagen structure in the superficial and the deep layers correlating with the Raman spectral analysis. The current study demonstrates the potential of Raman Spectroscopy and multimodal imaging to interrogate cartilage tissue and provides insight into the chemical and structural composition of its different layers with significant implications for OA diagnosis for an increasing aging demographic."

By comparing data from two periods with low and high infection rates, the results showed that among the various influences brought about by the prevalence of COVID-19, sleep disorders have a significant and widespread impact on the quality of life, especially for the elderly. Through the inclusion of Mendelian randomization analysis, we found that COVID-19 have a relative increase in the risk of developing insomnia by approximately 26.7% (OR = 1.267).

        "abstract": "The diagnostic and prognostic value of quantitative electroencephalogram (qEEG) in the the onset of postoperative delirium (POD) remains an area of inquiry. We aim to determine whether qEEG could assist in the diagnosis of early POD in cardiac surgery patients. We prospectively studied a cohort of cardiac surgery patients undergoing qEEG for evaluation of altered mental status. Delirium was assessed with the Confusion Assessment Method for the intensive care unit (CAM-ICU). The qEEG were interpreted by clinician, and reports were reviewed to identify features such as amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG), relative band energy in ɑ/β/θ/δ frequencies, α variability and spectral entropy. The raw EEG was also preprocessed offline for nonlinear analysis including Multi-scale Entropy analysis (MSE) and Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA). Linear regression was performed to quantify associations among EEG findings, delirium, and clinical outcomes. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to assess the accuracy of the qEEG as POD prediction index. Meanwhile, a comprehensive comparison of dynamic complexity across time scales and DFA exponent α was conducted between the non-delirium and delirium groups. Among those recruited initially (n = 64), 60 patients were evaluated and 29 patients (48.3%) met delirium criteria. When comparing delirious and non-delirious participants, significant differences were found in terms of age (p = 0.03), APACHE II scores (p = 0.004), lactate (p = 0.03), and hospital days (p = 0.048). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that the first quartile (Q1) and fourth quartile (Q4) of peak or valley value of F3-P3/F4-P4 derivation (for example, Q1 of peak value for F3-P3 derivation: OR 12.4, 95% CI 1.72–89.76, p = 0.012) showed a higher association with the incidence of POD. ROC analysis demonstrated qEEG could predict POD with high sensitivity and specificity, yielding an overall good accuracy. For instance, the peak value of F3-P3 derivation (the area under the curve of 0.81), as a predictor of POD showed a sensitivity of 90% and specificity pf 72% (p < 0.001). Furthermore, the MSE curves indicated that the non-delirium group exhibited higher complexity values at fine scales, while the delirium group had significantly higher complexity at coarse scales. The DFA comparison results revealed that long-term fractal exponent alpha2 values were higher in delirium patients than in non-delirium patients, with significant differences observed at the F4-P4 electrodes (p = 0.04). The qEEG can reliably predict delirium after heart cardiac surgery. It is helpful for clinicians to early diagnose and manage these patients."

Our results show significant differences between 3D and 0D single-cell models as risk levels increase, underscoring the ability of 3D modeling to capture more complex cardiac responses. The emulators demonstrated an average error of 4% compared to simulations, allowing for efficient global sensitivity analysis and fast replication of in silico clinical trials. This approach enables rapid, multi-dose drug testing on standard hardware, addressing critical industry challenges around trial design, assay variability, and cost-effective safety evaluations. By integrating these emulators into drug development, we can improve preclinical reliability and advance the practical application of digital twins in biomedicine."

A comprehensive search across major databases selected studies utilizing AI for vertebral fracture diagnosis or prognosis. Out of 14,161 studies initially identified, 79 were included, with 40 undergoing meta-analysis. Diagnostic models were stratified by pathology: non-pathological vertebral fractures, osteoporotic vertebral fractures, and vertebral compression fractures. The primary outcome measure was AUROC. AI showed high accuracy in diagnosing and predicting vertebral fractures: predictive AUROC = 0.82, osteoporotic vertebral fracture diagnosis AUROC = 0.92, non-pathological vertebral fracture diagnosis AUROC = 0.85, and vertebral compression fracture diagnosis AUROC = 0.87, all significant (p < 0.001). Traditional models had the highest median AUROC (0.90) for fracture prediction, while deep learning models excelled in diagnosing all fracture types. High heterogeneity (I² > 99%, p < 0.001) indicated significant variation in model design and performance. AI technologies show considerable promise in improving the diagnosis and prognostication of vertebral fractures, with high accuracy.

While quantum mechanical (QM) predictions using DL techniques such as graph neural networks (GNNs) and generative models are gaining traction, insufficient training data remains a bottleneck. The QM40 dataset addresses this challenge by representing 88% of the FDA-approved drug chemical space. It includes molecules containing 10 to 40 atoms and composed of elements commonly found in drug molecular structures (C, O, N, S, F, Cl). QM40 offers valuable resources for researchers which include the core QM40 main dataset, containing 16 key quantum mechanical parameters for 162,954 molecules calculated using the B3LYP/6-31G(2df,p) level of theory in Gaussian16, ensuring consistency with established datasets like QM9 and Alchemy. This compatibility allows for future concatenation of QM40 with these datasets. In addition to other valuable information, the QM40 dataset offers the initial and optimized Cartesian coordinates, Mulliken charges, and detailed bond information, including local vibrational mode force constants, which serve as indicators of bond strength. QM40 can be used to benchmark both existing and new methods for predicting QM calculations using ML and DL techniques."

        "abstract": "Artificial intelligence promises to revolutionize mental health care, but small dataset sizes and lack of robust methods raise concerns about result generalizability. To provide insights on minimal necessary data set sizes, we explore domain-specific learning curves for digital intervention dropout predictions based on 3654 users from a single study (ISRCTN13716228, 26/02/2016). Prediction performance is analyzed based on dataset size (N = 100–3654), feature groups (F = 2–129), and algorithm choice (from Naive Bayes to Neural Networks). The results substantiate the concern that small datasets (N ≤ 300) overestimate predictive power. For uninformative feature groups, in-sample prediction performance was negatively correlated with dataset size. Sophisticated models overfitted in small datasets but maximized holdout test results in larger datasets. While N = 500 mitigated overfitting, performance did not converge until N = 750–1500. Consequently, we propose minimum dataset sizes of N = 500–1000. As such, this study offers an empirical reference for researchers designing or interpreting AI studies on Digital Mental Health Intervention data."

Addressing this challenge head-on, this study introduces an innovative deep learning framework tailored for DR diagnosis. The proposed framework utilizes the EfficientNetB0 architecture to classify diabetic retinopathy severity levels from retinal images. By harnessing advanced techniques in computer vision and machine learning, the proposed model aims to deliver precise and dependable DR diagnoses. Continuous testing and experimentation shows to the efficiency of the architecture, showcasing promising outcomes that could help in the transformation of both diagnosing and treatment of DR. This framework takes help from the EfficientNet Machine Learning algorithms and employing advanced CNN layering techniques. The dataset utilized in this study is titled ’Diagnosis of Diabetic Retinopathy’ and is sourced from Kaggle. It consists of 35,108 retinal images, classified into five categories: No Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), Mild DR, Moderate DR, Severe DR, and Proliferative DR. Through rigorous testing, the framework yields impressive results, boasting an average accuracy of 86.53% and a loss rate of 0.5663. A comparison with alternative approaches underscores the effectiveness of EfficientNet in handling classification tasks for diabetic retinopathy, particularly highlighting its high accuracy and generalizability across DR severity levels. These findings highlight the framework’s potential to significantly advance the field of DR diagnosis, given more advanced datasets and more training resources which leads it to be offering clinicians a powerful tool for early intervention and improved patient outcomes."

Four hypoxia levels were induced by creating a gradient of oxygen partial pressure through changes in altitude and external hypoxia stimulation. The dataset was collected in a hypoxic chamber that simulates altitude changes, allowing for a refined classification of different hypoxia levels based on ranges of oxygen saturation. The total recorded EEG data amounts to approximately 10.25 hours. Validation results indicate that the four hypoxia levels can be effectively recognized using EEG signals. Compared to binary classification, our fine-grained dataset allows for more precise detection of hypoxia levels. This dataset is anticipated to have significant research and practical value in developing accurate methods for identifying hypoxia levels. As a valuable and standardized resource, it will enable extensive analysis and comparison for researchers in the field of high-altitude hypoxia."

Yet, response rates are still limited, and tumour progression commonly occurs2. Soluble and cell-bound factors in the tumour microenvironment negatively affect cancer immunity. Recently, growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15), a cytokine that is abundantly produced by many cancer types, was shown to interfere with antitumour immune response. In preclinical cancer models, GDF-15 blockade synergistically enhanced the efficacy of anti-PD-1-mediated checkpoint inhibition3. In a first-in-human phase 1–2a study (GDFATHER-1/2a trial, NCT04725474), patients with advanced cancers refractory to anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy (termed generally as anti-PD-1/PD-L1 refractoriness) were treated with the neutralizing anti-GDF-15 antibody visugromab (CTL-002) in combination with the anti-PD-1 antibody nivolumab. Here we show that durable and deep responses were achieved in some patients with non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer and urothelial cancer, two cancer entities identified as frequently immunosuppressed by GDF-15 in an in silico screening of approximately 10,000 tumour samples in The Cancer Genome Atlas database. Increased levels of tumour infiltration, proliferation, interferon-γ-related signalling and granzyme B expression by cytotoxic T cells were observed in response to treatment. Neutralizing GDF-15 holds promise in overcoming resistance to immune checkpoint inhibition in cancer."

The integration of these technologies into clinical care is imminent, most notably in clinical psychology and psychiatry but also other disciplines (e.g., cardiology, neurology, neurosurgery, pain management). Meanwhile, ethical guidelines for implementation are lacking, as are insights into what patients and caregivers want and need to know about these technologies to ensure acceptability and informed consent. In this work, we present qualitative findings from interviews with 40 adolescent patients and their caregivers examining ethical and practical considerations for translating these technologies into clinical care. We observed seven key domains (in order of salience) in stakeholders’ informational needs: (1) clinical utility and value; (2) evidence, explainability, evaluation and contestation; (3) accuracy and trustworthiness; (4) data security, privacy, and misuse; (5) patient consent, control, and autonomy; (6) physician-patient relationship; and (7) patient safety, well-being, and dignity. Drawing from these themes, we provide a checklist of questions, as well as suggestions and key challenges, to help researchers and practitioners respond to what stakeholders want to know when integrating these technologies into clinical care and research. Our findings inform participatory approaches to co-designing treatment roadmaps for using these AI-based tools for enhanced patient engagement, acceptability and informed consent."

The results showed that both NLR and BLR were significant but not independent prognostic factors for in-hospital mortality; NLR was negatively correlated with hospital LOS while ELR was positively correlated with hospital LOS; both increased NLR and increased BLR were associated with reduced OS, while increased ELR was associated with improved OS; increased PLR, NLR, MLR, and BLR were all correlated with elevated ICU admission rates, while increased ELR was correlated with a reduced ICU admission rate; ELR was positively correlated with ICU LOS; both higher NLR and higher BLR were associated with increased ICU mortality. In summary, NLR and BLR were useful prognostic factors for clinical outcomes in patients with SCAP."

Here, the data transformation and normalization processes are applied to balance the dataset’s properties. Then, an Intriguing Group Teaching Optimization (IGTO) algorithm is applied to choose the most correlated and essential traits from the normalized dataset for effective intrusion detection. Consequently, a Conditional Probabilistic Deep Auto-Encoder (CPDAE) model is used to more accurately classify the type of intrusion with system complexity. This study uses the BoT-IoT, Kaggle invasion dataset, and ToN-IoT open benchmarking datasets for evaluation and performance assessments. Among all, the proposed GTPDA with its various performance metrics presented, achieves an impressive 98.8% precision, 99% recall, 98.8% F1-score, and 99% accuracy, showing its significant performance in ensuring IoMT network security."

        "abstract": "Intracranial aneurysms (IA) pose significant health risks and are often challenging to manage. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation has emerged as a powerful tool for understanding lesion-specific hemodynamics in and around IAs, aiding in the clinical management of patients with an IA. However, the current workflow of CFD simulations is time-consuming, complex, and labor-intensive and, thus, does not fit the clinical environment. To address these challenges, we have developed a semi-automated pipeline integrating multiple open-source software packages to streamline the CFD simulation process. Specifically, the study utilized medical angiography data from 18 patients. An in-house open-source DL image segmentation model (ARU-Net) was employed to generate 3D computer models of the anterior circulation. The segmented intracranial vasculature models, including IAs, were further refined using the Vascular Modeling Toolkit (VMTK), an open-source Python package. This step involved smoothing the surface of the models and extending the inlet and outlet regions to ensure a realistic representation of the vascular geometry. The refined vascular models were then converted into computational meshes using an open-source mesh generator known as TetGen. This process was nearly automated and required minimal user interaction(s). Blood flow simulations of the cerebral vascular models were performed using established SimVascular solvers (an open-source finite element platform for vascular applications) through an application programming interface (API). The CFD simulation process was also conducted using the manual workflow for comparative purposes. The initial assessment compared the geometries derived from manual and DL-based segmentation. The DL-based segmentation demonstrated reliable performance, closely aligning with manually segmented results, evidenced by excellent Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) values and low relative difference (RD) values ranging from 3% to 10% between the computed geometrical variables derived from both methods. The statistical analysis of the computed hemodynamic variables, including velocity informatics and WSS-related variables, indicated good to excellent reliability for most parameters (e.g., ICC of 0.85–0.95). Given the data investigated, the proposed automated workflow streamlines the process of conducting CFD simulations. It generates results consistent with the current standard manual CFD protocol while minimizing dependence on user input."

Image fusion enhances the applicability and quality of data. Hence, the analysis of multimodal image fusion is a new to the research topic, which is designed by combining the images of multimodal into single image in order to preserveexact details. On the other hand, the existing approaches face challenges in the precise interpretation of source images, and also it have only captured local information without considering the wide range of information. To consider these weaknesses, a multimodal image fusion model is planned to develop according to the multi-resolution transform along with the optimization strategy. At first, the images are effectively analyzed from standard public datasets and further, the images given into the Optimized Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform (ODTCWT) to acquire low frequency and high frequency coefficients. Here, certain parameters in DTCWT get tuned with the hybridized heuristic strategy with the Probability of Fitness-based Honey Badger Squirrel Search Optimization (PF-HBSSO) to enhance the decomposition quality. Then, the fusion of high-frequency coefficients is performed using adaptive weighted average fusion technique, whereas the weights are optimized using PF-HBSSOto achieve the optimal fused results. Similarly, the low-frequency coefficients are combined by average fusion. Finally, the fused images undergo image reconstruction using the inverse ODTCWT.

The algorithm’s predictive performance was evaluated based on in-hospital cardiac arrest, inotropic circulatory support, advanced airway, and intensive care unit admission. We developed an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm for CDSS that integrates multiple data modalities, including vitals, laboratory, and imaging results from electronic health records.

The algorithm’s predictions, based solely on triage information, significantly outperformed traditional logistic regression models, with notable improvements in the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC). Additionally, predictive accuracy improved with the inclusion of continuous data input at shorter intervals.

Perceived age is highly correlated with biological age, which reflects health appraisal and is often used as a clinical marker of aging. Perceived age has been reported as an important indicator of biological age and general health status, not only in older adult populations but also in young and middle-aged adults. However, there is a lack of objective methods for quantifying perceived age in these younger age groups. Thus, this study aimed to propose a novel perceived age estimation algorithm to meet the need for an objective method to predict perceived age. This cross-sectional study included 609 healthy men and 1388 healthy women (29.02–57.91 years, average 44.4 years) from 2017 to 2019 using data from the Korean Medicine Daejeon Citizen Cohort Study. The proposed algorithm comprised two steps. First, the initial predicted perceived age was estimated from facial images using a convolutional neural network (CNN) ensemble model. Then, the final perceived age was estimated using regression from the chronological age, sex, BMI, and initial predicted perceived age obtained in the first step. Better performance results were obtained by model averaging and model stacking generated from various basic regression models. The averaging models of Lasso, XGBoost, and CatBoost showed a mean absolute error of 2.2944, indicating that this algorithm can be used as a screening method for general health status in the population."

We developed a Universal IHC (UIHC) analyzer, a DL-based tool that quantifies protein expression across different cancers and IHC types. This multi-cohort trained model outperformed conventional single-cohort models in analyzing unseen IHC images (Kappa score 0.578 vs. up to 0.509) and demonstrated consistent performance across varying positive staining cutoff values. In a discovery application, the UIHC model assigned higher tumor proportion scores to MET amplification cases, but not MET exon 14 splicing or other non-small cell lung cancer cases. This UIHC model represents a novel role for DL that further advances quantitative analysis of IHC."

In this study we aimed to investigate the role of nitric oxide, insulin resistance, and vitamin D in cognitive function of elderly individuals. This case-control study involved participants aged ≥ 60 years who were under observation in the Birjand Longitudinal Aging Study. A total of 40 participants were selected as controls, while 64 participants with cognitive impairment were identified as cases. The cases were further subdivided according to their Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores into two groups: mild and moderate cognitive impairment. Cognitive function in both cases and controls was assessed using the MMSE. The levels of total NOx, vitamin D, insulin, and blood glucose were measured using ELISA and spectrophotometric immunoassays. Insulin resistance indices, such as homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) were calculated. Serum NOx levels were significantly lower in participants with cognitive impairment compared to the control group (p < 0.01). However, the mean (SD) levels of serum vitamin D, insulin, and glucose, as well as the insulin resistance markers, showed no significant differences between the groups. A positive correlation was observed between serum NOx levels and MMSE scores. NO may be an essential factor for normal brain function, as serum NOx levels were significantly higher in controls compared to those with cognitive impairment, and there was a positive correlation with MMSE scores. Other metabolic and nutritional markers, including vitamin D and insulin resistance, did not demonstrate a significant effect."

        "abstract": "Pandemics like COVID-19 have a huge impact on human society and the global economy. Vaccines are effective in the fight against these pandemics but often in limited supplies, particularly in the early stages. Thus, it is imperative to distribute such crucial public goods efficiently. Identifying and vaccinating key spreaders (i.e., influential nodes) is an effective approach to break down the virus transmission network, thereby inhibiting the spread of the virus. Previous methods for identifying influential nodes in networks lack consistency in terms of effectiveness and precision. Their applicability also depends on the unique characteristics of each network. Furthermore, most of them rank nodes by their individual influence in the network without considering mutual effects among them. However, in many practical settings like vaccine distribution, the challenge is how to select a group of influential nodes. This task is more complex due to the interactions and collective influence of these nodes together. This paper introduces a new framework integrating Graph Neural Network (GNN) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for vaccination distribution. This approach combines network structural learning with strategic decision-making. It aims to efficiently disrupt the network structure and stop disease spread through targeting and removing influential nodes. This method is particularly effective in complex environments, where traditional strategies might not be efficient or scalable. Its effectiveness is tested across various network types including both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrting a potential for real-world applications in fields like epidemiology and cybersecurity. This interdisciplinary approach shows the capabilities of deep learning in understanding and manipulating complex network systems."

Traditional diagnostic techniques for CeD include serological testing and endoscopic examination; however, they have limitations. Therefore, there is a need to identify novel noninvasive biomarkers for CeD diagnosis. We analyzed duodenal and plasma samples from CeD patients by four-dimensional data-dependent acquisition (4D-DIA) proteomics. Differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified for functional analysis and to propose blood biomarkers associated with CeD diagnosis. In duodenal and plasma samples, respectively, 897 and 140 DEPs were identified. Combining weighted gene co-expression network analysis(WGCNA) with the DEPs, five key proteins were identified across three machine learning methods. FGL2 and TXNDC5 were significantly elevated in the CeD group, while CHGA expression showed an increasing trend, but without statistical significance. The receiver operating characteristic curve results indicated an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.7711 for FGL2 and 0.6978 for TXNDC5, with a combined AUC of 0.8944. Exploratory analysis using Mfuzz and three machine learning methods identified four plasma proteins potentially associated with CeD pathological grading (Marsh classification): FABP, CPOX, BHMT, and PPP2CB.

This variability complicates accurate progression modelling and early-stage prediction. Traditional classification methods based on clinical symptoms are often limited by disease heterogeneity. This study introduces an graph-based interpretable personalized progression method, utilizing data from the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) and Stroke Parkinson’s Disease Biomarker Program (PDBP). Our approach integrates multimodal inter-individual and intra-individual data, including clinical assessments, MRI, and genetic information to make multi-dimension predictions. Validated using the PDBP dataset from 12 to 36 months, our AdaMedGraph method demonstrated strong performance, achieving AUC values of 0.748 and 0.714 for the 12-month Hoehn and Yahr Scale and Movement Disorder Society-Sponsored Revision of the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) III on the PPMI test set. Ablation analysis reveals the importance of baseline clinical assessment predictors. This novel framework improves personalized care and offers insights into unique disease trajectories in PD patients."

Identifying them for disease surveillance in electronic medical records (EMRs) is challenged by sparsity of predictors. This study introduced a novel approach to phenotype people who have injected drugs using structured EMR data and interactive human-in-the-loop methods. We iteratively trained random forest classifiers removing important features and adding new positive labels each time. The initial model achieved 92.7% precision and 93.5% recall. Models maintained >90% precision and recall after nine iterations, revealing combinations of less obvious features influencing predictions. Applied to approximately 1.7 million patients, the final model identified 128,704 (7.7%) patients as potentially having injected drugs, beyond the 50,510 (2.9%) with known indicators of injecting drug use. This process produced explainable models that revealed otherwise hidden combinations of predictors, offering an adaptive approach to addressing the inherent challenge of inconsistently missing data in EMRs."

        "abstract": "Cyclotriazadisulfonamide (CADA) is a macrocyclic compound known for its unique mechanism in inhibiting HIV infection by downregulating the CD4 T-cell receptor, a crucial entry point for the virus. Unlike other antiretrovirals, CADA exhibits activity against a wide range of HIV strains, as all HIV variants require CD4 binding for infection. Furthermore, CADA has shown a synergistic effect with clinically approved anti-HIV drugs, offering potential for enhanced therapeutic strategies (Vermeire & Schols, [65]). One proposed mechanism for CADA’s inhibition of the CD4 receptor involves blocking the gates of the Sec61 channel, thereby preventing its translocation. However, CADA suffers from poor solubility and bioavailability. To address this, the study aimed to design CADA analogs with improved binding to the Sec61 channel, enhanced bioavailability, and reduced toxicity. The analogs were designed using SeeSAR, with Avogadro and Meeko used for 3D configuration and pseudoatom placement, respectively. AutoDock Vina version 1.2.4 was employed to predict the binding energies of these analogs. Of the 113 analogs designed, 93 demonstrated a more negative binding energy to the Sec61 channel compared to CADA. Structure-binding energy analyses were done to the top-binding analogs to show favorable structural modifications. Enzyme-ligand interactions were analyzed to elucidate the forces contributing to these binding energies. Additionally, 33 of the 113 analogs were deemed bioavailable using a bioavailability criteria specific for macrocycles. Toxicity predictions using PASS Online and StopTox identified analogs JGL023, JGL024, JGL032, and JGL047 as potential drug candidates. Molecular dynamics simulations using Gromacs-2020.4 revealed that JGL023 and JGL032 exhibited the most favorable binding to the Sec61 channel, as determined by evaluating ligand and residue flexibility, compactness, contact frequency, motion pathways, free energy, and other relevant parameters. Synthetic routes for these four analogs were proposed for future studies. The results of this study offer a new perspective on developing drugs to inhibit HIV entry."

Notably, the neural network models underwent rigorous evaluation, with EfficientNet-B0 exhibiting exceptional performance as the winning model. EfficientNet-B0 achieved a remarkable accuracy of 97%, surpassing ResNet-18 (87%) and basic CNN (80%) in classifying malignant and benign cases. In addition to accuracy, a comprehensive set of evaluation metrics was employed for EfficientNet-B0: sensitivity of 99%, specificity of 93%, F1-score of 97%, precision of 95%, and an error rate of 3%. It also demonstrated a Mathew’s correlation coefficient of 94% and a geometric mean of 1.01. Across these metrics, EfficientNet-B0 consistently outperformed ResNet-18 and basic CNN. The findings from this research suggest that neural network models, particularly EfficientNet-B0, hold significant promise for precise and efficient melanoma skin cancer detection."

We present the data supporting this qualification, providing insights into the evidentiary basis of qualification as a digital clinical outcome assessment. Clinical trials, natural history studies, and patient surveys (ages 5 − 14 years) showed that SV95C is accurate, valid, reliable, sensitive, and clinically meaningful. SV95C significantly correlated with traditional DMD assessments, increased rapidly after steroid initiation (0.090 m/s 3 months post-treatment), and declined steadily in patients on stable steroid regimens. Compared with traditional assessments, SV95C demonstrated earlier sensitivity to disease progression (3 vs 9 months) and greater sensitivity at 12 months. Distribution- and anchor-based approaches revealed a change of − 0.10 to − 0.20 m/s as clinically meaningful. The EMA qualification of SV95C illustrates the willingness of regulators to accept novel digital endpoints for drug approval, setting an important precedent for the evidentiary basis of regulatory digital endpoint qualification that could transform clinical development in disorders affecting movement."

The incidence of stroke in ICU settings is notably higher compared to the general population, and delays in diagnosis can lead to irreversible neurological damage. Early diagnosis of stroke is critical to protect brain tissue and treat neurological defects. Therefore, we developed a machine learning model to diagnose stroke in patients with acute neurological manifestations in the ICU. We retrospectively collected data on patients’ underlying diseases, blood coagulation tests, procedures, and medications before neurological symptom onset from 206 patients at the Chungbuk National University Hospital ICU (July 2020–July 2022) and 45 patients at Chungnam National University Hospital between (July 2020–March 2023). Using the Categorical Boosting (CatBoost) algorithm with Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter selection and k-fold cross-validation to mitigate overfitting, we analyzed model-feature relationships with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values. Internal model validation yielded an average accuracy of 0.7560, sensitivity of 0.8959, specificity of 0.7000, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.8201. External validation yielded an accuracy of 0.7778, sensitivity of 0.7500, specificity of 0.7931, and an AUROC of 0.7328. These results demonstrated the model’s effectiveness in diagnosing stroke in non-neurological ICU patients with acute neurological manifestations using their electronic health records, making it valuable for the early detection of stroke in ICU patients."

Current sputum-based TB treatment monitoring methods face numerous challenges, particularly in relation to sample collection and analysis. This pilot study explores the potential of TB status assessment using DNA methylation (DNAm) signatures, which are gaining recognition as diagnostic and predictive tools for various diseases. We collected buccal swab samples from pulmonary TB patients at the commencement of TB treatment (n = 10), and at one, two, and six-month follow-up intervals. We also collected samples from healthy controls (n = 10) and individuals exposed to TB (n = 10). DNAm patterns were mapped using the Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC 850 K platform. A DNAm profile distinct from controls was discovered in the oral mucosa of TB patients at the start of treatment, and this profile changed throughout the course of TB treatment. These findings were corroborated in a separate validation cohort of TB patients (n = 41), monitored at two and six months into their TB treatment. We developed a machine learning model to predict symptom scores using the identified DNAm TB profile. The model was trained and evaluated on the pilot, validation, and two additional independent cohorts, achieving an R2 of 0.80, Pearson correlation of 0.90, and mean absolute error of 0.13. While validation is needed in larger cohorts, the result opens the possibility of employing DNAm-based diagnostic and prognostic tools for TB in future clinical practice."

Firstly, detected the disease related genes (i.e. differentially expressed genes) according to the results of gene functional analysis as intermediate concepts to carry out Literature-based Knowledge Discovery. Taking the disease “Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)” as an example, the potential “disease-drug” association was predicted, and the predicted drugs were verified from the perspective of bioinformatics. Two drugs potentially associated with ASD were found: Fish oil and Forskolin, which were closely related to ASD in bioinformatics analysis results and literature verification. The two “disease-drug” association results showed better scientificity. The BIOINF-ABC+ model improves the accuracy of calculations by 76% compared to using the BITOLA system alone. In addition, it also shows high accuracy and credibility in literature verification. The BIOINF-ABC+ model based on the “Swanson framework + Bioinformatics” has good practicality, applicability, and accuracy in conducting “disease-drug” association prediction in the biomedical field, and can be used for mining “disease-drug” relationships."

In the Clinical Pregnancy Rates dataset, the Matched group (282 cycles) showed significantly higher clinical pregnancy rates than the Mismatched group (34.6% vs. 25.9%, p = 0.04) and similar results for patients under 37 (41.1% vs. 30.7%, p = 0.04). Logistic regression indicated lower pregnancy rates in Mismatched cases (odds ratio 0.67 for the general population, 0.63 for patients under 37). In conclusion, we introduce a highly accurate AI ovulation prediction model. Treatment cycles aligning with the model’s recommendations had significantly increased clinical pregnancy rates."

SurfDock employs a generative diffusion model on a non-Euclidean manifold, optimizing molecular translations, rotations and torsions to generate reliable binding poses. Our extensive evaluations across various benchmarks demonstrate SurfDock’s superiority over existing methods in docking success rates and adherence to physical constraints. It also exhibits remarkable generalizability to unseen proteins and predicted apo structures, while achieving state-of-the-art performance in virtual screening tasks. In a real-world application, SurfDock identified seven novel hit molecules in a virtual screening project targeting aldehyde dehydrogenase 1B1, a key enzyme in cellular metabolism. This showcases SurfDock’s ability to elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying cellular processes. These results highlight SurfDock’s potential as a transformative tool in structural biology, offering enhanced accuracy, physical plausibility and practical applicability in understanding protein–ligand interactions."

Meanwhile, chest X-ray (CXR) imaging is also known to exhibit signs of PDA and is a routine imaging modality in neonatal intensive care units. In this study, we aim to find and objectively define CXR image features that are associated with PDA by training and visually analyzing a deep learning model. We first collected 4617 echocardiograms from neonatal intensive care unit patients and 17,448 CXR images that were taken 4 days before to 3 days after the echocardiograms were obtained. We trained a deep learning model to predict the presence of severe PDA using the CXR images, and then visualized the model using GradCAM++ to identify the regions of the CXR images important for the model’s prediction. The visualization results showed that the model focused on the regions around the upper thorax, lower left heart, and lower right lung. Based on these results, we hypothesized and evaluated three radiographic features of PDA: cardiothoracic ratio, upper heart width to maximum heart width ratio, and upper heart width to thorax width ratio. We then trained an XGBoost model to predict the presence of severe PDA using these radiographic features combined with clinical features. The model achieved an AUC of 0.74, with a high specificity of 0.94. Our study suggests that the proposed radiographic features of CXR images can be used as an auxiliary tool to predict the presence of PDA in preterm infants. This can be useful for the early detection of PDA in neonatal intensive care units in cases where echocardiography is not available."

To identify dermoscopic features predicting treatment responses in cryotherapy for cutaneous warts. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 119 warts in 103 patients. Responses were categorized as complete, partial, or none after three sessions of cryotherapy within 4 months. The evaluated features included vascularity, papillary patterns, and margin characteristics. Marked surface scales and well-defined margins were common in complete responses. Minimal surface scales and smooth patterns were observed in less responsive cases. In the group with a complete response, marked surface scales were observed 6.59 times more frequently, well-defined margins were 4.1 times more common, and dots were 4.07 times more common compared to the group with no response. Common warts responded well when showing vascularity and marked surface scales, whereas plantar warts responded positively when showing background erythema. Dermoscopic features, such as dots, marked surface scales, and well-defined margins, predict a favorable cryotherapy response in cutaneous warts. Plantar warts respond positively in the presence of perilesional erythema, whereas common warts exhibit vascularity and marked surface scales for a better response to cryotherapy."

Factors known to be associated with cognition that can be gathered from accelerometers, user interfaces, and other sensors within wearable devices could be used to train machine learning models and develop wearable-based cognitive monitoring systems. Using data from over 2400 older adults in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) we developed prediction models to differentiate older adults with normal cognition from those with poor cognition based on outcomes from three cognitive tests measuring different domains of cognitive function. During repeated cross-validation CatBoost, XGBoost, and Random Forest models performed best when predicting poor cognition based on tests measuring processing speed, working memory, and attention (median AUCs ≥0.82) compared to immediate and delayed recall (median AUCs ≥0.72) and categorical verbal fluency (median AUC ≥ 0.68). Activity and sleep parameters were also more strongly associated with poor cognition based on tests assessing processing speed, working memory, and attention compared to other cognitive subdomains. Our work provides proof of concept that data collatable through wearable devices such as age, education, sleep parameters, activity summaries, and light exposure metrics could be used to differentiate between older adults with normal versus poor cognition. We further identified metrics that could be targets in future causal studies seeking to better understand how sleep and activity parameters influence cognitive function among older adults."

Shortcutting makes it trivial to create models with surprisingly accurate predictions that lack all face validity. This case study shows how easily shortcut learning happens, its danger, how complex it can be, and how hard it is to counter. We use simple ResNet18 convolutional neural networks (CNN) to train models to do two things they should not be able to do: predict which patients avoid consuming refried beans or beer purely by examining their knee X-rays (AUC of 0.63 for refried beans and 0.73 for beer). We then show how these models’ abilities are tied to several confounding and latent variables in the image. Moreover, the image features the models use to shortcut cannot merely be removed or adjusted through pre-processing. The end result is that we must raise the threshold for evaluating research using CNNs to proclaim new medical attributes that are present in medical images."

        "abstract": "Although corticosteroids are an important treatment for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients, many subjects develop dependence, leading to serious long-term side effects. We applied causal inference analyses to investigate the length of steroid use on reoperations in IBD patients. We identified subjects in the UK Biobank general practice dataset with at least one major GI surgery and followed them for at least 5 years to evaluate subsequent operations. We defined steroid dependence as at least 12 weeks of use (vs. acute steroid use) prior to baseline surgery. Of the 363 subjects included in our analyses, 163 (45%) were prescribed steroids on or before baseline surgery, and of these (N = 125 of 163, 77%) were dependent. Additional analyses for time-dependent data on prescriptions found a link between prescription length and reoperation. Among UC subjects with acute use, the odds of reoperation were significantly lower (OR: 0.32, 95% CI: 0.0–0.73). Steroid dependence resulted in a delay of reoperation (median 1.2 vs. 2.3 years, P = 0.01). Our findings indicate that long-term steroid use tends to increase the need for reoperation, whereas short-term use may reduce it."

Locomotive syndrome was assessed using the 5-question Geriatric Locomotive Function Scale (GLFS-5). Linear discriminant analysis effect size showed an enrichment of Actinobacteria and depletion of Firmicutes in GLFS-5 positive individuals. Classification tree analysis identified three terminal nodes as GLFS-5 positive, with one node involving Holdemania. Participants aged ≥70.0 and <78.0 years who did not consume probiotic foods and had ≥0.04% relative abundance of Holdemania were classified as at risk for locomotive syndrome. Our findings suggest a potential association between gut microbiota, particularly higher Holdemania abundance, and locomotive syndrome in older adults. This study provides insights into the complex relationship between gut microbiome composition and musculoskeletal health in aging populations. However, the cross-sectional design limits causal inference."

This research introduces a novel assessment and auto-identification approach for autistic children based on the appearance of children, which is a relatively objective, fast, and cost-effective approach. Initially, a custom social interaction scenario was developed, followed by a facial data set (ACFD) that contained 187 children, including 92 ASD and 95 children typically developing (TD). Using computer vision techniques, some appearance features of children including facial appearing time, eye concentration analysis, response time to name calls, and emotional expression ability were extracted. Subsequently, these features were combined and machine learning methods were used for the classification of children. Notably, the Bayes classifier achieved a remarkable accuracy of 94.1%. The experimental results show that the extracted visual appearance features can reflect the typical symptoms of children, and the automatic recognition method can provide an auxiliary diagnosis or data support for doctors."

We hypothesize that EEG features and Synek scale score, a measure of degree of EEG abnormality, are associated with ICANS severity. Here, we performed a retrospective review of 125 adult patients at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) who received CAR-T cell therapy from 2010 to 2019, including 53 patients with B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated with 1928z CAR T cells (NCT01044069) and 72 patients with large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) treated with the commercial CAR T products axicabtagene ciloleucel or tisagenlecleucel. We collected video EEG monitoring (27 with B-ALL and 20 with LBCL) and recorded daily EEG features, Synek scores, and ICANS grade for 47 eligible patients. Synek scale and ICANS grade were positively correlated (correlation coefficient 0.47, 95% CI: 0.31–0.60). This was further corroborated in the univariable model associating high Synek scale (3 or 4) with high ICANS grade (OR = 15.2; 95%CI:7.8–29.7, p < 0.0001). EEG features such as discontinuity, absence of posterior dominant rhythm, and presence of generalized sharp waves were statistically significantly associated with higher ICANS grade in univariable models. In the multivariable model, discontinuity (OR = 4.2 (95%CI:1.3–13.8, p = 0.02) and absence of posterior dominant rhythm (OR = 10.5 (95%CI:4.6–23.9, p < 0.0001) were statistically associated with higher ICANS grade. Overall, EEG discontinuity and absence of posterior dominant rhythm were independently associated with higher severity of neurotoxicity. Further, our data suggest that Synek Scale, may be a severity marker for neurotoxicity."

A machine learning (ML) approach for early detection of MSI, enforced rest, and retirement events using this same horse-level, race-level, and stride characteristic data across all race sectionals was investigated. A CatBoost model using features from the two races prior to an event had the highest classification performance (sensitivity score for MSI, enforced rest and retirement equal to 0.00, 0.58, 0.76, respectively and balanced accuracy score corresponding to 0.44), with scores decreasing for models incorporating windows that included additional races further from the event. Feature importance analysis of ML models demonstrated that retirement was predicted by older age, poor performance, and longer racing career, enforced rest was predicted by younger age and better performance, but was less likely to occur when the stride length is increasing, and MSI predicted by increased number of starters, greater variation in speed and lower percentage of career time at rest. A relatively low classification performance highlights the difficulties in discerning MSI from alternate events using ML. Improved data recording through more thorough assessment and annotation of adverse events is expected to improve the predictability of MSI."

        "abstract": "Viruses are submicroscopic agents that can infect other lifeforms and use their hosts’ cells to replicate themselves. Despite having simplistic genetic structures among all living beings, viruses are highly adaptable, resilient, and capable of causing severe complications in their hosts’ bodies. Due to their multiple transmission pathways, high contagion rate, and lethality, viruses pose the biggest biological threat both animal and plant species face. It is often challenging to promptly detect a virus in a host and accurately determine its type using manual examination techniques. However, computer-based automatic diagnosis methods, especially the ones using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) images, have proven effective in instant virus identification. Using TEM images collected from a recent dataset, this article proposes a deep learning-based classification model to identify the virus type within those images. The methodology of this study includes two coherent image processing techniques to reduce the noise present in raw microscopy images and a functional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for classification. Experimental results show that it can differentiate among 14 types of viruses with a maximum of 97.44% classification accuracy and F1-score, which asserts the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed method. Implementing this scheme will impart a fast and dependable virus identification scheme subsidiary to the thorough diagnostic procedures."

        "abstract": "This study performed advanced toxicological assessments of the new substance AP-238 using nine ‘green’ in silico methods, focusing on acute toxicity, organ-specific effects, skin and eye irritation, genetic toxicity, and cardiotoxicity. A quantitative assessment of AP-238’s acute toxicity (AT) was performed by predicting theoretical LD50 values for both rats and mice across different administration routes using various in silico methods. Results indicated the highest toxicity via intravenous administration in mice, with a t-LD50 of 53 mg/kg, while oral administration in rats exhibited a lower toxicity range, with t-LD50 values between 666.43 and 1838.77 mg/kg, depending on the predictive model used. The identification of toxicophores (the fragment connecting the benzene ring to the piperazine ring, including the α, β, and γ carbon atoms near the nitrogen atom) in AP-238 suggests a high likelihood of lung toxicity (61%), with additional risks to the cardiovascular (58%) and renal systems (56%), emphasizing specific molecular fragments associated with these adverse effects. Genotoxic evaluations presented a mixed view, with low to moderate probabilities of a positive Ames test, suggesting some uncertainty but generally indicating a reduced risk of genetic toxicity. Eye and skin irritation risks were deemed minimal, supported by several models with high confidence. Cardiotoxicity assessments revealed varied information on the potential effects of AP-238 on the hERG channel, with some studies suggesting a nonsignificant impact, while others indicated moderate risk, although with low reliability in the predictions. This highlights the nuanced challenges in assessing the safety of novel substances through ‘green’ in silico methods."

We analysed the data of 12,316 asymptomatic adults (51.7 ± 8.5 years; 84.2% men) with a mean follow-up of 3.3 years. Participants were divided into two groups: those with and without hyperuricemia (serum uric acid levels > 7.0 mg/dL for men and > 6.0 mg/dL for women). CAC progression was defined as a difference of ≥ 2.5 between the square roots of the baseline and follow-up coronary artery calcium score (CACS) (Δ√transformed CACS). The incidence of CAC progression was higher in men with hyperuricemia than in those without the condition (37.9% vs. 32.3%, P < 0.001); however, no significant difference in the incidence of CAC progression was observed in women with and without hyperuricemia (20.2% vs. 15.8%, P = 0.243). After adjusting for age, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidaemia, obesity, current smoking status, serum creatinine, baseline CACS, and inter-scan periods, hyperuricemia was associated with increased risk of CAC progression in men (odds ratio [OR]: 1.20, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06 − 1.36, P = 0.004); however, hyperuricemia was not significantly associated with the risk of CAC progression in women (OR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.36 − 1.49, P = 0.385). In conclusion, hyperuricemia is more closely associated with CAC progression in men than in women among asymptomatic Korean adults."

This retrospective observational cohort study utilized data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV 2.2) database. The primary outcome was the development of acute respiratory failure in asthma patients. Initially, the Boruta algorithm and SHapley Additive exPansions were applied to preliminarily determine the feature importance of the TyG index, and a risk prediction model was constructed to evaluate its predictive ability. Secondly, Logistic regression proportional hazards models were employed to assess the association between the TyG index and acute respiratory failure in asthma patients. Finally, subgroup analyses were conducted for sensitivity analyses to explore the robustness of the results. A total of 751 asthma patients were included in the study. When considering the TyG index as a continuous variable, logistic regression analysis revealed that in the unadjusted Model 1, the odds ratio (OR) was 2.381 (95% CI: 1.857–3.052; P < 0.001), in Model II, the OR was 2.456 (95% CI: 1.809–3.335; P < 0.001), and in the multivariable-adjusted model, the OR was 1.444 (95% CI: 1.029–2.028; P = 0.034). A consistent association was observed between the TyG index and the risk of acute respiratory failure in asthma patients. No significant interaction was found between the TyG index and various subgroups (P > 0.05). Furthermore, machine learning results indicated that an elevated TyG index was a significant feature predictive of respiratory failure in asthma patients. The baseline risk model achieved an AUC of 0.743 (95% CI: 0.679–0.808; P < 0.05), whereas the combination of the baseline risk model with the TyG index yielded an AUC of 0.757 (95% CI: 0.694–0.821; P < 0.05). The TyG index can serve as a predictive indicator for acute respiratory failure in asthma patients, albeit confirmation of these findings requires larger-scale prospective studies."

In contrast, the absence of fidgety movements is a core feature of several neurodevelopmental and cognitive disorders. Currently, manual assessment of early infant movement patterns is time consuming and labour intensive, limiting its wider use. Recent advances in computer vision and deep learning have led to the emergence of pose estimation techniques, computational methods designed to locate and track body points from video without specialised equipment or markers, for movement tracking. In this study, we use automated markerless tracking of infant body parts to build statistical models of early movements. Using a dataset of infant movement videos (n = 486) from 330 infants we demonstrate that infant movement can be modelled as a sequence of eight motor states using autoregressive, state-space models. Each, motor state Is characterised by specific body part movements, the expression of which varies with age and differs in infants at high-risk of poor neurodevelopmental outcome."

Translation into the clinical arena has been slow because of time taken to mask the region of interest and owing to differences in T2* results depending on field strength. This paper contributes methodology to remove these barriers by utilising data from 0.55, 1.5 and 3T MRI to provide a fully automated segmentation tool; determining field strength dependency of placental assessment techniques; and deriving normal ranges for T2* by gestational age but independent of field strength. T2* datasets were acquired across field strengths. Automatic quantification including fully automatic masking was achieved and tested in 270 datasets across fields. Normal curves for quantitative placental mean T2*, volume and other derived measurements were obtained in 273 fetal MRI scans and z-scores calculated. The fully automatic segmentation achieved excellent quantification results (Dice scores of 0.807 at 3T, 0.796 at 1.5T and 0.815 at 0.55T.). Similar changes were seen between placental T2* and gestational age across all three field strengths (p < 0.05). Z-scores were generated. This study provides confidence in the translatability of T2* trends across field strengths in fetal imaging."

        "abstract": "Non-specific shoulder pain is a common musculoskeletal condition, especially among college students, and it can have a negative impact on the patient’s life. Therapists have used scapular stabilization exercises (SSE) to enhance scapular control and mobility. This study investigates the prediction of the impact of scapular stability exercises in treating non-specific shoulder pain, leveraging advanced machine learning techniques for comprehensive evaluation and analysis. Using a diverse range of regression models, including Gamma Regressor, Tweedie Regressor, Poisson Regressor, and others, the study examines the relationship between the effectiveness of various exercises and their impact on shoulder pain management. Furthermore, the study employs optimization techniques, such as Hyperopt, scikit-optimize, optunity, GPyOpt, and Optuna, to fine-tune the exercise protocols for optimal outcomes. The results reveal that scapular stabilization exercises, when optimized using machine learning algorithms, significantly contribute to reducing shoulder pain in college students. Among the optimization techniques, scikit-optimize demonstrated the best performance, resulting in a mean squared error of 0.0085, a mean absolute error of 0.0712, and an impressive R2 score of 0.8501. This indicates that the scikit-optimize approach yielded the most accurate predictions and effectively captured the relationship between the exercises and shoulder pain management. The findings highlight the critical role of scapular stabilization exercise interventions in ameliorating non-specific shoulder pain and underscore the potential of machine learning techniques in optimizing therapeutic strategies for musculoskeletal health management. The utilization of scikit-optimize, in particular, showcases its effectiveness in fine-tuning the exercise protocols for optimal outcomes. The study’s results serve as a crucial stepping stone in developing personalized rehabilitation programs for non-specific shoulder pain, emphasizing the importance of integrating machine learning methodologies in the assessment and treatment of musculoskeletal disorders among college students."

        "abstract": "Automatic and accurate tooth segmentation on 3D dental point clouds plays a pivotal role in computer-aided dentistry. Existing Transformer-based methods focus on aggregating local features, but fail to directly model global contexts due to memory limitations and high computational cost. In this paper, we propose a novel Transformer-based 3D tooth segmentation network, called PointRegion, which can process the entire point cloud at a low cost. Following a novel modeling of semantic segmentation that interprets the point cloud as a tessellation of learnable regions, we first design a RegionPartition module to partition the 3D point cloud into a certain number of regions and project these regions as embeddings in an effective way. Then, an offset-attention based RegionEncoder module is applied on all region embeddings to model global context among regions and predict the class logits for each region. Considering the irregularity and disorder of 3D point cloud data, a novel mechanism is proposed to build the point-to-region association to replace traditional convolutional operations. The mechanism, as a medium between points and regions, automatically learns the probabilities that each point belongs to its neighboring regions from the similarity between point and region features, achieving the goal of point-level segmentation. Since the number of regions is far less than the number of points, our proposed PointRegion model can leverage the capability of the global-based Transformer on large-scale point clouds with low computational cost and memory consumption. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method on our dental dataset."

Coffee is a habitually consumed beverage with established metabolic and health benefits. We previously found that coffee is, among >150 items, the food showing the highest correlation with microbiome components. Here we conducted a multi-cohort, multi-omic analysis of US and UK populations with detailed dietary information from a total of 22,867 participants, which we then integrated with public data from 211 cohorts (N = 54,198). The link between coffee consumption and microbiome was highly reproducible across different populations (area under the curve of 0.89), largely driven by the presence and abundance of the species Lawsonibacter asaccharolyticus. Using in vitro experiments, we show that coffee can stimulate growth of L. asaccharolyticus. Plasma metabolomics on 438 samples identified several metabolites enriched among coffee consumers, with quinic acid and its potential derivatives associated with coffee and L. asaccharolyticus. This study reveals a metabolic link between a specific gut microorganism and a specific food item, providing a framework for the understanding of microbial dietary responses at the biochemical level."

After addressing mitigable failures, these two models can concatenate up to 50 simultaneous tasks effectively, with validation on a public medical question-answering dataset. An economic analysis demonstrated up to a 17-fold cost reduction at 50 tasks using concatenation. These results identify the limits of LLMs for effective utilization and highlight avenues for cost-efficiency at the enterprise scale."

        "abstract": "This study aims to explore the interplay between locomotor demands and goal differentials to better understand their combined influence on overall success. Spanning three competitive seasons within the male Turkish Super League, this study analyzed all participating teams across 124 matches. Locomotor demands, including total distance (m) covered (TD), distances covered (m) at different speed thresholds (0.21–2.0 m/s; 2.01–4.0 m/s; 4.01–5.5 m/s; and 5.5–7.7 m/s), and the number of accelerations in range of 5.5–7.0 m/s (n), were quantified using an optical tracking system. Subsequently, regression models were employed to predict the total points earned by all teams over the three seasons. The logistic regression model, tailored to predict team categorization as high-points earners (HPE) or low-points earners (LPE) based on locomotor variables, exhibited a mean accuracy of 74%. Notably, total distance covered, running speed intervals between 4.4 and 5.5 m/s, and the number of accelerations in range of 5.5–7.0 m/s emerged as significant predictors of team success. Our findings highlight the pivotal role of running speed (4.01–5.5 m/s), number of accelerations, and total distance in predicting success for high-performing teams. Coaches can leverage these insights to refine training programs, thereby optimizing team performance, and fostering success in competitive environments."

        "abstract": "Hip fractures significantly affect patients’ health and quality of life. Despite therapeutic treatments, many patients continue to experience poor prognoses that include recurrent fractures and mortality, especially the older ones. Therefore, understanding important factors associated with post-fracture prognoses is critical. This study focuses on patients’ multimorbidity trajectories and examines how the trajectory’s time span, number of coexisting chronic diseases, and sequential disease patterns relate to distinct prognostic outcomes. From the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan, we obtain a sample of 128,822 patients who suffered an initial hip fracture between 1996 and 2011. We use this sample to analyze the relationships between multimorbidity trajectories and prognostic outcomes after an initial hip fracture. The results reveal that a patient’s multimorbidity trajectory’s time span and number of chronic diseases significantly associate with his or her post-fracture prognosis. In addition, essential sequential patterns of chronic diseases relate to post-fracture prognoses too. We then leverage the discovered relationships to develop a cross-attention neural network method for estimating patients’ post-fracture prognoses and demonstrate its predictive utilities relative to several prevalent machine leaning methods. This study underscores the importance of leveraging the time span, number of chronic diseases, and sequential disease patterns in patients’ multimorbidity trajectory profile to estimate their prognoses within three years of an initial hip fracture, which can support physicians’ clinical decisions and patient management."

Clinics transfer embryos at the blastocyst stage on Day-5 but Day-3 embryo transfer offers the advantage of a shorter culture duration, which reduces exposure to laboratory conditions, potentially enhancing embryonic development within a more conducive uterine environment and improving the likelihood of successful pregnancies. In this paper, we present a novel ResNet-GRU deep-learning model to predict blastocyst formation at 72 HPI. The model considers the time-lapse images from the incubator from Day 0 to Day 3. The model predicts blastocyst formation with a validation accuracy of 93% from the cleavage stage. The sensitivity and specificity are 0.97 and 0.77 respectively. The deep learning model presented in this paper will assist the embryologist in identifying the best embryo to transfer at Day 3, leading to improved patient outcomes and pregnancy rates in ART."

We aimed to evaluate the feasibility of a custom endoscopic optical coherence tomography (OCT) probe for assessing colorectal polyps during routine colonoscopy. Patients referred for endoscopic treatment of large colorectal polyps were enrolled in this pilot clinical study, which used a side-viewing OCT catheter developed for use with an adult colonoscope. OCT images of polyps were captured during colonoscopy immediately before SoC treatment. A deep learning model was trained to differentiate benign from deeply invasive lesions for real-time diagnosis. 35 polyps from 32 patients were included. OCT imaging added on average 3:40 min (range 1:54–8:20) to the total procedure time. No complications due to OCT were observed. OCT revealed distinct subsurface tissue structures that correlated with histological findings, including tubular adenoma (n = 20), tubulovillous adenoma (n = 10), sessile serrated polyps (n = 3), and invasive cancer (n = 2). The deep learning model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.984 (95%CI 0.972–0.996) and Cohen’s kappa of 0.845 (95%CI 0.774–0.915) when compared to gold standard histopathology. OCT is feasible and safe for polyp assessment during routine colonoscopy. When combined with deep learning, OCT offers clinicians increase confidence in identifying deeply invasive cancers, potentially improving clinical decision-making. Compared to previous studies, ours offers a nuanced comparison between not just benign and malignant lesions, but across multiple histological subtypes of polyps."

The algorithm created was validated in data from a single institution. All images were segmented according to widely used guidelines for radiotherapy planning and combined with clinical evaluations from neuroradiology experts. Radiomic features and clinical impressions were extracted, tabulated, and used for modeling. Feature selection methods were used to identify relevant phenotypes. A total of 100 patients were used for training and 46 for validation. A total of 343 features were extracted. Eight feature selection methods produced seven independent predictive frameworks. The top-performing ML model was a model post-Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) feature selection reaching accuracy (ACC) of 0.82, an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.81, a recall of 0.75, and a precision of 0.75. This study demonstrates that integrating clinical and radiotherapy-derived AI-driven phenotypes can predict MGMT methylation.

This offers promise for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) for communication. However, translating these findings into a BCI paradigm has proven challenging. Existing EEG-based semantic decoding studies often rely on neural activity recorded when a cue is present, raising concerns about decoding reliability. To address this, we investigate the effects of cue presentation on EEG-based semantic decoding. In an experiment with a clear separation between cue presentation and mental task periods, we attempt to differentiate between semantic categories of animals and tools in four mental tasks. By using state-of-the-art decoding analyses, we demonstrate significant mean classification accuracies up to 71.3% during cue presentation but not during mental tasks, even with adapted analyses from previous studies. These findings highlight a potential issue when using neural activity recorded during cue presentation periods for semantic decoding. Additionally, our results show that semantic decoding without external cues may be more challenging than current state-of-the-art research suggests. By bringing attention to these issues, we aim to stimulate discussion and drive advancements in the field toward more effective semantic BCI applications."

        "abstract": "Thongprayoon et al. found in a study of 12,599 non-dialysis adult hospitalized patients that serum calcium (SC) disturbances affected more than half of the patients and were associated with increased in-hospital mortality. Similar impacts of SC disturbances on in-hospital mortality have been observed in patients with acute myocardial infarction and the general hospitalized population. Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common arrhythmia in the intensive care unit (ICU), affects around 6% of critically ill patients. However, the significance of the relationship between SC levels and in-hospital mortality in these patients remains unclear. This study aimed to explore the correlation between SC levels and in-hospital mortality in ICU patients diagnosed with AF. Data from the MIMIC-IV database included 11,621 AF patients (average age 75.59 ± 11.74 years; 42.56% male), with an in-hospital mortality rate of 8.90%. A nonlinear relationship between SC levels and in-hospital mortality was observed. Effect sizes on either side of the inflection point were 0.79 (HR: 0.79, 95% CI 0.67–0.94, P = 0.006) and 1.12 (HR: 1.12, 95% CI 1.01–1.25, P = 0.029). Sensitivity analyses confirmed these results. SC levels around 8.56 mg/dL were associated with the lowest risk of in-hospital mortality, with risks increasing as SC levels deviated from this point. SC levels below this inflection point were linked to more pronounced clinical impacts. This finding has significant clinical implications for clinicians. Therefore, in the treatment of ICU patients with AF, clinicians should closely monitor SC levels, with a focus on maintaining them around 8.56 mg/dL."

A series of scoping reviews that mapped the methods used in PM research and a gap analysis were followed by working sessions and workshops where field experts analyzed the gaps and developed recommendations. Through collaborative writing and consensus building exercises, the final recommendations were defined. They provide guidance for the design, implementation and evaluation of PM research, from patient and omics data collection and sample size calculation to the selection of the most appropriate stratification approach, including machine learning modeling, the development and application of reliable preclinical models, and the selection and implementation of the most appropriate clinical trial design. The dissemination and implementation of these recommendations by all stakeholders can improve the quality of PM research, enhance the robustness of evidence, and improve patient care."

MUGS integrates graphical data from both pediatric and general EHR systems, along with hierarchical medical ontologies, to create embeddings that adaptively capture both the homogeneity and heterogeneity between hospital systems. These embeddings enable refined EHR feature engineering and nuanced patient profiling, proving particularly effective in identifying pediatric patients similar to specific profiles, with a focus on pulmonary hypertension (PH). MUGS embeddings, resistant to negative transfer, outperform other benchmark methods in multiple applications, advancing evidence-based pediatric research."

While deep learning methods have shown significant success in analyzing medical images, they often require careful design of architecture and tuning of hyperparameters to achieve optimal results. This study presents a new approach for diagnosing brain tumors in MRI scans using deep learning, focusing on Residual/Shuffle Networks. The designed network structures offer efficient results when compared to traditional deep learning models. To enhance the proposed network for brain tumor classification, a modified metaheuristic algorithm named Augmented Falcon Finch Optimization (AFFO) is introduced. AFFO utilizes bio-inspired principles to effectively search for the best hyperparameter configurations, thereby enhancing the reliability and accuracy of the deep learning model. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on a standard brain tumor MRI dataset and compared with existing techniques, including ResNet, AlexNet, VGG-16, Inception V3, and U-Net to illustrate the effectiveness of combining Residual/Shuffle Networks with AFFO for brain tumor diagnosis."

Unfortunately, safely resectable residual tumour is found in the majority of patients with glioma after surgery, causing early recurrence and decreased survival4,5,6. Here we present FastGlioma, a visual foundation model for fast (<10 s) and accurate detection of glioma infiltration in fresh, unprocessed surgical tissue. FastGlioma was pretrained using large-scale self-supervision (around 4 million images) on rapid, label-free optical microscopy, and fine-tuned to output a normalized score that indicates the degree of tumour infiltration within whole-slide optical images. In a prospective, multicentre, international testing cohort of patients with diffuse glioma (n = 220), FastGlioma was able to detect and quantify the degree of tumour infiltration with an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 92.1 ± 0.9%. FastGlioma outperformed image-guided and fluorescence-guided adjuncts for detecting tumour infiltration during surgery by a wide margin in a head-to-head, prospective study (n = 129). The performance of FastGlioma remained high across diverse patient demographics, medical centres and diffuse glioma molecular subtypes as defined by the World Health Organization. FastGlioma shows zero-shot generalization to other adult and paediatric brain tumour diagnoses, demonstrating the potential for our foundation model to be used as a general-purpose adjunct for guiding brain tumour surgeries. These findings represent the transformative potential of medical foundation models to unlock the role of artificial intelligence in the care of patients with cancer."

Our goal was to utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) in preparing content-based feedback for the Progress Test Medizin and evaluate their effectiveness in this task. We utilize two popular LLMs and conduct a comparative assessment by performing textual similarity on the generated outputs. Furthermore, we study via a survey how medical practitioners and medical educators assess the capabilities of LLMs and perceive the usage of LLMs for the task of generating content-based feedback for PTM exams. Our findings show that both examined LLMs performed similarly. Both have their own advantages and disadvantages. Our survey results indicate that one LLM produces slightly better outputs; however, this comes at a cost since it is a paid service, while the other is free to use. Overall, medical practitioners and educators who participated in the survey find the generated feedback relevant and useful, and they are open to using LLMs for such tasks in the future. We conclude that while the content-based feedback generated by the LLM may not be perfect, it nevertheless can be considered a valuable addition to the numerical feedback currently provided."

Many clinicians theoretically assume that a high postoperative vault leads to rapid endothelial damage, but no study has yet proven this hypothesis. We conducted a paired-eye study to compare changes in corneal endothelial cell density (ECD) between high and low postoperative vault groups. This retrospective study included 150 eyes of 75 patients with bilateral postoperative vault levels differing by more than 200 μm after ICL implantation. Patients were followed up for 7 years with ECD measurements, and changes in ECD were assessed between 6 months and 7 years post-surgery. Over the 7-year follow-up period, the percentage of ECD loss was 15.04% and 14.45% in the high- and low-vault groups, respectively. The bilateral paired-eye comparison revealed a significant reduction in ECD in the high-vault group at 3, 5, and 7 years postoperatively (P-value < 0.001). In this paired-eye comparison of long-term observations, a higher vault was associated with greater ECD loss. Our study confirms that a high vault level may be an important risk factor for ECD loss following ICL implantation."

However, outside of clinical trials, cancer outcomes are typically recorded only in text form within electronic health records (EHRs). Artificial intelligence (AI) models have been trained to extract outcomes from individual EHRs. However, patient privacy restrictions have historically precluded dissemination of these models beyond the centers at which they were trained. In this study, the vulnerability of text classification models trained directly on protected health information to membership inference attacks is confirmed. A teacher-student distillation approach is applied to develop shareable models for annotating outcomes from imaging reports and medical oncologist notes. ‘Teacher’ models trained on EHR data from Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) are used to label imaging reports and discharge summaries from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV dataset. ‘Student’ models are trained to use these MIMIC documents to predict the labels assigned by teacher models and sent to Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK) for evaluation. The student models exhibit high discrimination across outcomes in both the DFCI and MSK test sets. Leveraging private labeling of public datasets to distill publishable clinical AI models from academic centers could facilitate deployment of machine learning to accelerate precision oncology research."

        "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly aggressive malignancy with increasing global prevalence and is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality in the human population. Developing robust clinical prediction models and prognostic stratification strategies is crucial for developing individualized treatment plans. A range of novel forms of programmed cell death (PCD) plays a role in the pathological progression and advancement of HCC, and in-depth study of PCD is expected to further improve the prognosis of HCC patients. Sixteen patterns (apoptosis, autophagy, anoikis, lysosome-dependent cell death, immunogenic cell death, necroptosis, ferroptosis, netosis, pyroptosis, disulfidptosis, entotic cell death, cuproptosis, parthanatos, netotic cell death, alkaliptosis, and oxeiptosis) related to PCD were collected from the literatures and used for subsequent analysis. Supervised (Elastic net, Random Forest, XgBoost, and Boruta) and unsupervised (Nonnegative Matrix Factorization, NMF) clustering algorithms were applied to develop and validate a novel classifier for the individualized management of HCC patients at the transcriptomic, proteomic and single-cell levels. Multiple machine learning algorithms developed a programmed cell death index (PCDI) comprising five robust signatures (FTL, G6PD, SLC2A1, HTRA2, and DLAT) in four independent HCC cohorts, and a higher PCDI was predictive of higher pathological grades and worse prognoses. Furthermore, a higher PCDI was found to be correlated with the presence of a repressive tumor immune microenvironment (TME), as determined through an integrated examination of bulk and single-cell transcriptome data. In addition, patients with TP53 mutation had higher PCDI in comparison with TP53 WT patients. Three HCC subtypes were identified through unsupervised clustering (NMF), exhibiting distinct prognoses and significant biological processes, among the three subtypes, PCDcluster 3 was of particular interest as it contained a large proportion of patients with high risk and low metabolic activity. Construction and evaluation of the Nomogram model was drawn based on the multivariate logistic regression analysis, and highlighted the robustness of the Nomogram model in other independent HCC cohorts. Finally, to explore the prognostic value, we also validated the frequent upregulation of DLAT in a real-world cohort of human HCC specimens by qPCR, western blot, and immunohistochemical staining (IHC). Together, our work herein comprehensively emphasized PCD-related patterns and key regulators, such as DLAT, contributed to the evolution and prognosis of tumor foci in HCC patients, and strengthened our understanding of PCD characteristics and promoted more effective risk stratification strategies."

Samples of each perineal tissue layer were obtained from the skin, the vagina, the external anal sphincter (EAS), the internal anal sphincter (IAS) and anal mucosa of freshly dead sows. They were tested in quasi-static uniaxial tension using the Mach-1 testing machine. Stress-strain curves of each perineal tissue layer before the first damage for each sow were obtained and modeled by hyperelastic laws described by three coefficients: C1, C2, and C3 (Yeoh model). The influence of sample preparation conditions such as tissue freezing, hygrometry and sample orientation were evaluated, and the conditions under which the tests were performed such as the displacement velocity during testing were also evaluated by analysing C1-coefficient. This study suggested that sample preparation conditions such as tissue freezing for 24 h, storage in cellophane paper for two hours and the strain rate did not statistically affect the C1-hyperelastic coefficient for each perineal layer (p > 0.05). Samples should not be stored in saline for 2 h (p < 0.05). Sample orientation did not influence C1-hyperelastic coefficient (p > 0.05). This experimental protocol could be used to study in vitro biomechanical properties of perineal tissues in order to better understand perineal tears during delivery."

        "abstract": "The most cost-effective data collection method is electroencephalography (EEG), which obtains meaningful information about the brain. Therefore, EEG signal processing is crucial for neuroscience and machine learning (ML). Therefore, a new EEG stress dataset has been collected, and an explainable feature engineering (XFE) model has been proposed using the Directed Lobish (DLob) symbolic language. The first phase of this research is the data collection phase, and an EEG stress dataset was gathered from 310 participants. This collected stress dataset contains two classes: (i) stress and (ii) control. An XFE model has been presented to detect stress automatically. The presented XFE model has four main phases, and these are (i) channel transformer and quadruple transition pattern (QuadTPat)-based feature generation, (ii) feature selection deploying cumulative weighted neighborhood component analysis (CWNCA), (iii) explainable results creation with DLob and (iv) classification with t algorithm-based k-nearest neighbors (tkNN) classifier. The proposed XFE model generates a DLob string, and the explainable results were obtained using this string. Moreover, the presented XFE model attained 92.95% and 73.63% classification accuracy, deploying 10-fold and leave-one subject-out (LOSO) cross-validations (CV). According to the classification performances, the recommended QuadTPat-based XFE is a good model for EEG signal classification. Also, the presented QuadTPat-based XFE model is a good model for explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) since TTPat-based XFE is cooperating with the DLob."

Seven widely used machine learning (ML) algorithms were employed to construct the prediction models. Adult patients from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database who stayed in the ICU for longer than 24 h were included in the development and internal validation. The model was subsequently externally validated using the eICU-CRD database. In addition, the SHapley Additive exPlanations method was employed to interpret the influence of individual parameters on the predictions made by the model. A total of 11,988 patients were included in the final cohort for this study. The CatBoost model demonstrated the best performance (AUC: 0.881). In the external validation set, the efficacy of our model was also confirmed (AUC: 0.750), which suggests robust generalization capabilities. The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), body mass index (BMI), arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2), respiratory rate (RR) and length of stay (LOS) before ICU were the top 5 features of the CatBoost model with the greatest impact. We developed an externally validated CatBoost model that accurately predicts the need for intubation in ICU patients within 24 to 96 h of admission, facilitating clinical decision-making and has the potential to improve patient outcomes. The prediction model utilizes readily obtainable monitoring parameters and integrates the SHAP method to enhance interpretability, providing clinicians with clear insights into the factors influencing predictions."

We show high performance of VideoMol in predicting molecular targets and properties across 43 drug discovery benchmark datasets. VideoMol achieves high accuracy in identifying antiviral molecules against common diverse disease-specific drug targets (i.e., BACE1 and EP4). Drugs screened by VideoMol show better binding affinity than molecular docking, revealing the effectiveness in understanding the three-dimensional structure of molecules. We further illustrate interpretability of VideoMol using key chemical substructures."

Our aim was to assess the impact of electrode design and distance from the myocardial electric source on the unipolar and bipolar electrograms to deduce a far-field cut-off. We retrospectively analyzed left atrial electroanatomical maps of 25 patients acquired using an ablation catheter with a 4.5 mm tip-, mini- and 2 mm ring electrodes. The unipolar and bipolar electrograms were characterized based on peak-to-peak amplitude, signal duration, maximal slope, and relative power of the high frequency spectrum above 50 Hz (HF_rel). The unipolar electrograms of ring electrodes showed an increased amplitude (140%), slope (150%) and HF_rel (16% vs. 11%) compared to the tip- and mini-electrodes. The median amplitude, slope, and HF_rel for the ring electrodes followed a power-law decay with distance with a steep decline up to 4 mm. This near-field cut-off can be identified based on a HF_rel above 10% in unipolar electrograms. In conclusion, we observed a higher unipolar amplitude for small ring-electrodes compared to larger tip-electrodes. The rapid decay of the amplitude, slope, and HF_rel up to a distance of 4 mm is suggestive for near-field cut-off identified based on HF_rel above 50 Hz."

A total of 174 patients who underwent SMILE surgery were included, and their preoperative ocular clinical parameters, visual quality indicators, and posterior lenticule laser scanning images were analyzed. The morphological features of black clefts were calculated using image processing techniques. Univariate and multivariate logistic analyses were conducted to identify factors impacting ultra-early visual acuity recovery, while correlation analysis was used to explore the association between black cleft morphology and postoperative visual quality. The results showed that although patients experienced significant visual acuity improvement one day after surgery, 26% had poor early recovery. Postoperative visual quality parameters were significantly lower, while the Object Scatter Index (OSI) was higher compared to preoperative values. Patients with poor visual recovery had a higher number of irregular black clefts in their laser scanning images. Logistic regression analysis revealed that intraoperative morphological parameters of black clefts were independent factors influencing early postoperative visual acuity recovery. Additionally, correlation analysis demonstrated a negative correlation between black cleft morphology and postoperative visual quality parameters, and a positive correlation with OSI. In conclusion, the morphology and distribution of black clefts during SMILE surgery significantly affect ultra-early postoperative visual acuity and quality, with increased variability in black cleft area leading to higher OSI, thereby impacting visual quality recovery."

In this study, we analyzed the relationship between 13 urinary heavy metal concentrations and AMD using NHANES data between 2005 and 2008. We constructed and compared 11 machine learning models to identify the best model for predicting AMD risk. We further interpreted the models by Permutation Feature Importance (PFI), Partial Dependence Plot (PDP) analysis, and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis. 216 AMD patients out of 2380 participants. The random forest (RF) model performed optimally in predicting the risk of AMD, with an AUC value of 0.970. PFI analyses revealed that age and urinary cadmium (Cd) were the main factors influencing the risk of AMD. SHAP analyses further confirmed the significance of Cd concentration in predicting the risk of AMD, and we revealed a significant interaction with significant interaction of race. Our study firstly explored the relationship between heavy metal exposure levels and AMD based on machine learning techniques, found that urinary Cd concentration had the greatest impact on AMD, and revealed the superior predictive performance of machine learning methods.

Randomized clinical trials provide evidence supporting de-escalation of axillary surgery and omission of SLNB in patients at low risk. However, identifying sentinel lymph node macrometastases (macro-SLNMs) is crucial for planning treatment tailored to the individual patient. This study is the first to explore the capacity of deep learning (DL) models to identify macro-SLNMs based on preoperative clinicopathological characteristics. We trained and validated five multivariable models using a population-based cohort of 18,185 patients. DL models outperform logistic regression, with Transformer showing the strongest results, under the constraint that the sensitivity is no less than 90%, reflecting the sensitivity of SLNB. This highlights the feasibility of noninvasive macro-SLNM prediction using DL. Feature importance analysis revealed that patients with similar characteristics exhibited different nodal status predictions, indicating the need for additional predictors for further improvement."

Based on the deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture residual network with 101 layers (ResNet-101), spatial attention and channel attention modules were introduced to optimize the model. A retrospective collection of MRI image data from 210 EC patients was used for model segmentation and reconstruction, with 140 cases as the test set and 70 cases as the validation set. The performance was compared with traditional ResNet-101 model, ResNet-101 model based on spatial attention mechanism (SA-ResNet-101), and ResNet-101 model based on channel attention mechanism (CA-ResNet-101), using accuracy (AC), precision (PR), recall (RE), and F1 score as evaluation metrics. Among the 70 cases in the validation set, there were 45 cases of low-risk EC and 25 cases of high-risk EC. Using ROC curve analysis, it was found that the area under the curve (AUC) for the diagnosis of high-risk EC of the proposed model in this article (0.918) was visibly larger as against traditional ResNet-101 (0.613), SA-ResNet-101 (0.760), and CA-ResNet-101 models (0.758).

Dermoscopy images can help clinicians for timely identification of cancer, but manual diagnosis is time-consuming, costly, and prone to human error. To conduct this, an innovative deep learning-based approach has been proposed for automatic melanoma detection. The proposed method involves preprocessing dermoscopy images to remove artifacts, enhance contrast, and cancel noise, followed by feeding them into an optimized Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The CNN is trained using an innovative metaheuristic called the Improved Chameleon Swarm Algorithm (CSA) to optimize its performance. The approach has been validated using the SIIM-ISIC Melanoma dataset and the results have been confirmed through rigorous evaluation metrics. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in accurately diagnosing melanoma from dermoscopy images by highlighting its potential as a valuable tool for clinicians in early cancer detection."

Leveraging MSK-CHORD to train machine learning models to predict overall survival, we find that models including features derived from natural language processing, such as sites of disease, outperform those based on genomic data or stage alone as tested by cross-validation and an external, multi-institution dataset. By annotating 705,241 radiology reports, MSK-CHORD also uncovers predictors of metastasis to specific organ sites, including a relationship between SETD2 mutation and lower metastatic potential in immunotherapy-treated lung adenocarcinoma corroborated in independent datasets. We demonstrate the feasibility of automated annotation from unstructured notes and its utility in predicting patient outcomes.

However, the completely non-invasive determination of IDH mutation status using routinely acquired preoperative native CT images has hardly been investigated to date. In our study, we show that radiomics-based machine learning allows to determine IDH mutation status based on preoperative native CT images both with very high accuracy and completely non-invasively. Based on independent test data, we are able to correctly identify 91.1% of cases with an IDH mutation. Our final model, containing only six features, exhibits a high area under the curve of 0.847 and an excellent area under the precision-recall curve of 0.945. In the future, such models may be used for a completely non-invasive prediction of important genetic markers, potentially allowing treating physicians to reduce the number of biopsies and speed up further treatment planning."

In particular, contrastive representation learning techniques trained on large multi-modal datasets have demonstrated impressive capabilities of producing highly transferable representations for different downstream tasks. In ophthalmology, large multi-modal datasets are abundantly available and conveniently accessible as modern retinal imaging scanners acquire both 2D fundus images and 3D optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans to assess the eye. In this context, we introduce a novel multi-modal contrastive learning-based pipeline to facilitate learning joint representations for the two retinal imaging modalities. After self-supervised pre-training on 153,306 scan pairs, we show that such a pre-training framework can provide both a retrieval system and encoders that produce comprehensive OCT and fundus image representations that generalize well for various downstream tasks on three independent external datasets, explicitly focusing on clinically pertinent prediction tasks. In addition, we show that interchanging OCT with lower-cost fundus imaging can preserve the predictive power of the trained models."

A retrospective analysis was conducted on 229 PTC patients who underwent total or near-total thyroidectomy and subsequent 131I treatment after levothyroxine (LT4) withdrawal between January 2022 and August 2023. The pathology model was developed through two stages: patch-level prediction and WSI-level prediction. The clinical model was constructed using statistically significant variables identified from univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Of the 229 patients, 19.6% (45/229) exhibited 131I-avid metastatic foci in post-therapeutic 131I scan. Multifactorial analysis identified stimulated thyroglobulin (sTg) as the sole independent risk factor. The AUC of the pathology model in the training and test cohorts were 0.976 (95% CI 0.948–1.000) and 0.805 (95% CI 0.660–0.951), respectively, which were significantly higher than the clinical model (AUC 0.652 and 0.548, Pall < 0.05).

Although computed topography offers detailed imaging, its high radiation poses risks, especially to children. Therefore, we propose a deep-learning model for CSO and suture-line classification using 2D cranial X-rays that minimises radiation-exposure risks and offers reliable diagnoses. We used data comprising 1,047 normal and 277 CSO cases from 2006 to 2023. Our approach integrates X-ray-marker removal, head-pose standardisation, skull-cropping, and fine-tuning modules for CSO and suture-line classification using convolution neural networks (CNNs). It enhances the diagnostic accuracy and efficiency of identifying CSO from X-ray images, offering a promising alternative to traditional methods. Four CNN backbones exhibited robust performance, with F1-scores exceeding 0.96 and sensitivity and specificity exceeding 0.9, proving the potential for clinical applications. Additionally, preprocessing strategies further enhanced the accuracy, demonstrating the highest F1-scores, precision, and specificity. A qualitative analysis using gradient-weighted class activation mapping illustrated the focal points of the models. Furthermore, the suture-line classification model distinguishes five suture lines with an accuracy of > 0.9. Thus, the proposed approach can significantly reduce the time and labour required for CSO diagnosis, streamlining its management in clinical settings."

Subsequently, we quantified the assessment by segmenting the soleus muscle based on the extracellular space/matrix and fiber region to determine the degree of damage. The muscle fiber-to-extracellular space/matrix ratio were significantly damaged due to paralysis on the left side (control vs. 14 d, P = 0.040). Muscle area was significantly different at 14 d between the left and right sides (P = 0.010).

To address this, we propose a triangulation approach that integrates expert and theory-driven group model building, literature review, and data-driven causal discovery. We demonstrate the utility of this triangulation approach using a case example focused on the trajectory of depressive symptoms in response to a stressor in healthy adults. After triangulation with causal discovery, the CLD exhibited (1) greater comprehensiveness, encompassing multiple research fields; (2) a modified feedback structure; and (3) increased transparency regarding the uncertainty of evidence in the model structure. These findings suggest that triangulation can produce higher-quality CLDs, potentially advancing our understanding of complex diseases."

Datasets for HIV (GSE 37250) and monkeypox (GSE 24125) were obtained from the GEO database. Common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in co-infection were identified by intersecting DEGs from monkeypox datasets with genes from key HIV modules screened using Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA). After gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis and construction of protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, candidate hub genes were further screened based on machine learning algorithms. Transcriptional factors (TFs) and miRNA-candidate hub gene networks were constructed to understand regulatory mechanisms and protein-drug interactions to identify potential therapeutic drugs. Seven candidate hub genes—MX2, ADAR, POLR2H, RPL5, IFI16, IFIT2, and RPS5—were identified. TFs and miRNAs associated with these hub genes, playing a key role in regulating viral infection and inflammation due to the activation of antiviral innate immunity, were also identified through network analysis. Potential therapeutic drugs were screened based on these hub genes: AZT, a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor, suppressed viral replication in HIV and monkeypox co-infection, while mefloquine inhibited inflammation due to the activation of antiviral innate immunity. In conclusion, the study identified candidate hub genes, their transcriptional regulation, signaling pathways, and small-molecule drugs in HIV and monkeypox co-infection, contributing to understanding the pathogenesis of HIV and monkeypox co-infection and informing precise therapeutic strategies."

Various skin symptoms appear in people infected with this disease, which can spread easily, especially in a polluted environment. It is difficult to diagnose monkeypox in its early stages because of its similarity with the symptoms of other diseases such as chicken pox and measles. Recently, computer-aided classification methods such as deep learning and machine learning within artificial intelligence have been employed to detect various diseases, including COVID-19, tumor cells, and Monkeypox, in a short period and with high accuracy. In this study, we propose the CanDark model, an end-to-end deep-learning model that incorporates cancelable biometrics for diagnosing Monkeypox. CanDark stands for cancelable DarkNet-53, which means that DarkNet-53 CNN is utilized for extracting deep features from Monkeypox skin images. Then a cancelable method is applied to these features to protect patient information. Various cancelable techniques have been evaluated, such as bio-hashing, multilayer perceptron (MLP) hashing, index-of-maximum Gaussian random projection-based hashing (IoM-GRP), and index-of-maximum uniformly random permutation-based hashing (IoM-URP). The proposed approach’s performance is evaluated using various assessment issues such as accuracy, specificity, precision, recall, and fscore. Using the IoM-URP, the CanDark model is superior to other state-of-the-art Monkeypox diagnostic techniques. The proposed framework achieved an accuracy of 98.81%, a specificity of 98.73%, a precision of 98.9%, a recall of 97.02%, and fscore of 97.95%."

It included 56 eyes of 56 patients who underwent uncomplicated cataract surgery, with at least 1-month follow-up at Keio University Hospital in Tokyo or Hayashi Eye Hospital in Yokohama, Japan. Prediction errors, absolute errors, and percentage of eyes with prediction errors within ± 0.25 D, ± 0.50 D, and ± 1.00 D were calculated using nine formulas: Barrett True-K, Barrett True-K TK, Haigis-L, Haigis TK, Pearl-DGS, Hoffer QST, Hoffer QST PK, EVO K, and EVO PK. Statistical comparisons utilized Friedman test, Conover’s all-pairs post-hoc, Cochran’s Q, and McNemar post-hoc testing. Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE) was compared with heteroscedastic testing. Barrett True-K TK had the lowest median predicted refractive error (-0.01). EVO PK had the smallest median absolute error (0.20). EVO PK had the highest percentage of eyes within ± 0.25 D of the predicted value (58.9%), significantly better than Haigis-L (p = 0.047). EVO PK had the lowest mean RMSE value (0.499). The EVO PK formula yielded the most accurate IOL power calculation in post-myopic LASIK eyes, with TK/PK values enhancing accuracy."

Our approach counters the effects of unobserved confounding in observational data through a two-step process that adjusts predicted outcomes under treatment. These adjusted predictions train decision trees, optimizing treatment assignments for patient subgroups based on their characteristics, enabling intuitive treatment recommendations. Implementing this framework on gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) data, including genetic sub-cohorts, showed that our tree recommendations outperformed current guidelines in an external cohort. Furthermore, we extended the application of this framework to RCT data from patients with extremity sarcomas. Despite initial trial indications of universal treatment necessity, our framework identified a subset of patients who may not require treatment. Once again, we successfully validated our recommendations in an external cohort."

        "abstract": "Different oncologists make their own decisions about the detection and classification of the type of ovarian cancer from histopathological whole slide images. However, it is necessary to have an automated system that is more accurate and standardized for decision-making, which is essential for early detection of ovarian cancer. To help doctors, an automated detection and classification of ovarian cancer system is proposed. This model starts by extracting the main features from the histopathology images based on the ResNet-50 model to detect and classify the cancer. Then, recursive feature elimination based on a decision tree is introduced to remove unnecessary features extracted during the feature extraction process. Adam optimizers were implemented to optimize the network’s weights during training data. Finally, the advantages of combining deep learning and fuzzy logic are combined to classify the images of ovarian cancer. The dataset consists of 288 hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained whole slides with clinical information from 78 patients. H&E-stained Whole Slide Images (WSIs), including 162 effective and 126 invalid WSIs were obtained from different tissue blocks of post-treatment specimens. Experimental results can diagnose ovarian cancer with a potential accuracy of 98.99%, sensitivity of 99%, specificity of 98.96%, and F1-score of 98.99%. The results show promising results indicating the potential of using fuzzy deep-learning classifiers for predicting ovarian cancer."

This study utilized a cross-sectional dataset of 3,000 patients from the People’s Liberation Army General Hospital in 2021. Logistic regression was used as the baseline model to compare the prediction performance of the machine learning model and the related factors. The recursive feature elimination cross-validation (RFECV) algorithm was used to select features. Four machine learning models, support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), and gradient boost decision tree (GBDT), were developed to predict DR. The models were optimized using grid search to determine hyperparameters, and the model with superior performance was selected. Shapley-additive explanations (SHAP) were used to analyze the important correlation factors of DR. Among the four machine learning models, the optimal model was GBDT, with predicted accuracy, precision, recall, F1-measure, and AUC values of 0.7883, 0.8299, 0.7539, 0.7901, and 0.8672, respectively. Six key correlates of DR were identified, including rapid micronutrient protein/creatinine measurement, 24-h micronutrient protein, fasting C-peptide, glycosylated hemoglobin, blood urea, and creatinine. The logistic model had 27 risk factors, with an AUC value of 0.8341. A superior prediction model was constructed that identified easily explainable key factors. The number of correlation factors was significantly lower compared to traditional statistical methods, leading to a more accurate prediction performance than the latter."

        "abstract": "Clinical sleep diagnosis traditionally relies on polysomnography (PSG) and expert manual classification of sleep stages. Recent advancements in deep learning have shown promise in automating sleep stage classification using a single PSG channel. However, variations in PSG acquisition devices and environments mean that the number of PSG channels can differ across sleep centers. To integrate a sleep staging method into clinical practice effectively, it must accommodate a flexible number of PSG channels. In this paper, we proposed FlexSleepTransformer, a transformer-based model designed to handle varying number of input channels, making it adaptable to diverse sleep staging datasets. We evaluated FlexSleepTransformer using two distinct datasets: the public SleepEDF-78 dataset and the local SleepUHS dataset. Notably, FlexSleepTransformer is the first model capable of simultaneously training on datasets with differing number of PSG channels. Our experiments showed that FlexSleepTransformer trained on both datasets together achieved 98% of the accuracy compared to models trained on each dataset individually. Furthermore, it outperformed models trained exclusively on one dataset when tested on the other dataset. Additionally, FlexSleepTransformer surpassed state-of-the-art CNN and RNN-based models on both datasets. Due to its adaptability with varying channels numbers, FlexSleepTransformer holds significant potential for clinical adoption, especially when trained with data from a wide range of sleep centers."

All COVID-19 patients admitted to seven ICUs in the Euregio-Meuse Rhine during the first pandemic wave were included. The 4C Mortality and SEIMC scores were selected as promising prognostic models from an external validation study. Five predictors could be estimated based on cohort size. TRIPOD guidelines were followed and logistic regression analyses with the linear predictor, APACHE II score, and country were performed. Bootstrapping with backward selection was applied to select variables for the final model. Additionally, shrinkage was performed. Model discrimination was displayed as optimism-corrected areas under the ROC curve and calibration by calibration slopes and plots. The mortality rate of the 551 included patients was 36%. Discrimination of the 4C Mortality and SEIMC scores increased from 0.70 to 0.74 and 0.70 to 0.73 and calibration plots improved compared to the original models after updating and extending. Mortality prediction can be improved after updating and extending of promising models."

In the fusion system, we first improve the attention mechanism of vision transformer by revising the node encoding way, considering the spatial structure, edge and centrality of nodes, and then use its corresponding encoder as a feature extractor to comprehensively extract image features. Second, we introduce a concept-cognitive computing model as a classifier to evaluate the level of pain. Finally, we evaluate our PainC3M on various open pain data sets and a real clinical pain data stream, and the experimental results demonstrate that our PainC3M is very effective for dynamic classification and superior to other comparative models. It also provides a good approach for pain assessment of individuals with aphasia (or dementia)."

In this study, we utilized bioinformatics and machine learning methods to investigate the correlation between cellular senescence and the pathological mechanisms of unstable carotid plaques. Our aim was to elucidate the causes of unstable carotid plaque progression and identify new therapeutic strategies. First, differential expression analysis was performed on the test set GSE43292 to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the unstable plaque group and the control group. These DEGs were intersected with cellular senescence-associated genes to obtain 40 cellular senescence-associated DEGs. Subsequently, key genes were then identified through weighted gene co-expression network analysis, random forest, Recursive Feature Elimination for Support Vector Machines algorithm and cytoHubba plugin. The intersection yielded 3 CSA-signature genes, which were validated in the external validation set GSE163154. Additionally, we assessed the relationship between these CSA-signature genes and the immune landscape of the unstable plaque group. This study suggests that cellular senescence may play an important role in the progression mechanism of unstable plaques and is closely related to the influence of the immune microenvironment. Our research lays the foundation for studying the progression mechanism of unstable carotid plaques and provides some reference for targeted therapy."

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a smartphone-based method for measuring Blood Pressure (BP) using the oscillometric method. For oscillometry, it is necessary to measure (1) the pressure applied to the artery and (2) the local blood volume change. This is accomplished by performing an oscillometric measurement at the finger’s digital artery, whereby a user presses down on the phone’s camera with steadily increasing force. The camera is used to capture the blood volume change using photoplethysmography. We devised a novel method for measuring the force applied of the finger without the use of specialized smartphone hardware with a technique called Vibrometric Force Estimation (VFE). The fundamental concept of VFE relies on a phenomenon where a vibrating object is dampened when an external force is applied on to it. This phenomenon can be recreated using the phone’s own vibration motor and measured using the phone’s Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). A cross device reliability study with three smartphones of different manufacturers, shape, and prices results in similar force estimation performance across all smartphone models. In an N = 24 proof of concept study of the BP measurement, the smartphone technique achieves a mean absolute error of 9.21 mmHg and 7.77 mmHg of systolic and diastolic BP, respectively, compared to an FDA approved BP cuff. The vision for this technology is not necessarily to replace existing BP monitoring solutions, but rather to introduce a downloadable smartphone software application that could serve as a low-barrier hypertension screening measurement fit for widespread adoption."

Participant nonresponse to follow-up surveys presents a potential threat to the validity and generalizability of study findings. In recent years, predictive analytics has emerged as a promising tool to identify predictors of nonresponse. Here, we develop a high-skill classifier using machine learning techniques to predict participant response to follow-up surveys of the Millennium Cohort Study. Six supervised algorithms were employed to predict response to the 2021 follow-up survey. Using latent class analysis (LCA), we classified participants based on historical survey response and compared prediction performance with and without this variable. Feature analysis was subsequently conducted on the best-performing model. Including the LCA variable in the machine learning analysis, all six algorithms performed comparably. Without the LCA variable, random forest outperformed the benchmark regression model, however overall prediction performance decreased. Feature analysis showed the LCA variable as the most important predictor. Our findings highlight the importance of historical response to improve prediction performance of participant response to follow-up surveys. Machine learning algorithms can be especially valuable when historical data are not available. Implementing these methods in longitudinal studies can enhance outreach efforts by strategically targeting participants, ultimately boosting survey response rates and mitigating nonresponse."

(2) Context Fusion Bridge is presented to remix the feature maps with multiple scales and construct their correlations. The experiments on ACDC, Synapse and Kvasir-SEG datasets are conducted to evaluate the performance of DATTNet. Our proposed model shows superior performance, effectiveness and robustness compared to SOTA methods, with mean Dice Similarity Coefficient scores of 92.2%, 84.5% and 89.1% on cardiac, abdominal organs and gastrointestinal poly segmentation tasks. The quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that our proposed DATTNet attains favorable capability across different modalities (MRI, CT, and endoscopy) and can be generalized to various tasks.

Here, we tested this hypothesis by examining whether patients with AMD with SDDs are more likely to have a cardiovascular-related condition and/or undergo a cardiovascular procedure. This is a retrospective cohort study. We included a total of 597 patients with AMD either with SDDs (n = 332) or without SDDs (n = 265). All patients underwent spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). The SD-OCT scans were annotated by masked, experienced graders. We also extracted data from the patients’ electronic medical records (EMRs), including patient demographics, cardiovascular diagnoses, and CVD-related procedures based on ICD-9 codes. AMD patients with SDDs were more likely to be diagnosed with CVD or undergo a cardiovascular procedure compared to AMD patients without SDDs, particularly percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA; OR 2.73, 95% CI [1.21, 6.13], p = 0.02). Multivariate analysis confirmed the association between the presence of SDDs and a background of PTCA in the presence of other covariates. These data suggest that the presence of SDDs in patients with AMD correlates with certain severe cardiovascular conditions; SDDs and CVD may share common pathogenic pathways."

Two knee datasets have been utilized for training, validating, and testing the proposed model. We use transfer learning with two pre-trained models, AlexNet and ResNet50, comparing the results with those of the proposed model.  The results indicate that the performance of the pre-trained models, namely AlexNet and ResNet50, was inferior to that of the proposed Superfluity DL architecture.

This study used metabolomics, machine learning algorithms and bioinformatics to screen for potential metabolic biomarkers associated with the diagnosis of PAH. In this study, plasma samples were collected from 17 patients diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) and 20 healthy controls. Plasma metabolomic profiling was performed by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Gene profiles of PAH patients were obtained from the GEO database. Key differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs) and metabolism-related genes were subsequently identified using machine learning algorithms. Twenty differential plasma metabolites associated with IPAH were identified (VIP score > 1 and p < 0 0.05), and enrichment analysis revealed the arginine biosynthesis pathway as the most altered pathway. Using machine learning models, including least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM), we extracted key metabolites that correlated with clinical phenotypes. Our results suggested that five metabolites, kynurenine, homoserine, tryptophan, AMP, and spermine, are potential biomarkers for IPAH. Bioinformatics analysis also identified 3 metabolism-related genes, MAPK6, SLC7A11 and CDC42BPA, that are strongly correlated with pulmonary hypertension, demonstrating strong predictive power and clinical relevance. Our findings revealed some key genes associated with metabolism in PH, and provided crucial information about complex metabolic reprogramming signals and may lead to the identification of useful metabolic biomarkers for the diagnosis of PAH."

Methods A total of 220 patients with surgically and pathologically confirmed BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer from 2 institutions were retrospectively included. All patients from institution 1 were randomized at a 7:3 ratio into a training cohort (n = 108) and an internal validation cohort (n = 45), and patients from institution 2 were used as an external validation cohort (n = 67). The association between the radiomics features and early recurrence was assessed in the training cohort and verified in the validation cohort. Furthermore, the performance of the radiomics nomogram was evaluated by combining the rad-score and clinical risk factors. The predictive performance was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, calibration curve analysis, and decision curve analysis. Results The dierenees in the Lymphocyte/monocyte ratio (LMR) and Peripheral nerve infiltration (PNI) were statistically significant between the early recurrence in BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer groups and the early non-recurrence in BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer groups (P < 0.05); The two groups showed no significant differenee in clinical parameters including age, sex, and biochemistry serum markers (P > 0.05). Comparing with the pure radiomics or clinical data, combined models can be seen that the addition of LMR and PNI further improveed the predictive efficiency of the model. The rad-score based on LR, generated by 4 selected radiomics features, demonstrated a favorable ability to predict early recurrence in both the training (AUC 0.81), internal validation (AUC 0.73), external validation (AUC 0.63) cohorts. Subsequently, integrating two independent predictors into a nomogram exhibited more favorable discriminatory performance, with the AUC improved to 0.88 and 0.81 in both cohorts. Conclusions The proposed CT-based radiomics signature is associated with early recurrence among the patients with BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer. The present study also proposes a combined model can potentially be applied in the individual preoperative prediction of early recurrence in patients with BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer. Advances in knowledge CT-based radiomics showed satisfactory diagnostic significance for early recurrence in patients with BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer. Key baseline clinical characteristics were associated with early recurrence in patients with BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer. The combined model may be applied in the individual preoperative prediction of early recurrence in patients with BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer."

        "abstract": "Background Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is among the most common complications of bariatric surgery. This study aimed to analyse the risk factors affecting the worsening of GERD symptoms after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), and to establish and validate a related nomogram model. Methods The study recruited 236 participants and randomly divided them into training and validation sets in a ratio of 7:3. LASSO regression technique was used to select the optimal predictive features, and multivariate logistic regression was used to construct the column line graphs. The performance of the nomogram was evaluated and validated by analyzing the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, calibration curve, and decision curve. Results In this study, Lasso-logistic regression was applied to select 5 predictors from the relevant variables, which were body mass index (BMI), diabetes, hiatal hernia, GERD, and triglyceride levels. These 5 predictor variables constructed a model with moderate predictive power, with an area under the ROC curve of 0.779 for the training set and 0.796 for the validation set. Decision curve analysis showed that in external validation, if the risk thresholds were between 4 and 98% and 14–95%, then the nomogram can be applied to the clinic. Conclusions We have developed and validated a nomogram that effectively predicts the risk of worsening gastroesophageal reflux symptoms following LSG."

        "abstract": "In response to the pressing requirement for precise and easily accessible COVID-19 detection methods, we present the Cough2COVID-19 framework, which is cost-effective, non-intrusive, and widely accessible. The conventional diagnostic methods, notably the PCR test, are encumbered by limitations such as cost and invasiveness. Consequently, the exploration of alternative solutions has gained momentum. Our innovative approach employs a multi-layer ensemble deep learning (MLEDL) framework that capitalizes on cough audio signals to achieve heightened efficiency in COVID-19 detection. This study introduces the Cough2COVID-19 framework, effectively addressing these challenges through AI-driven analysis. Additionally, this study proposed the CoughFeatureRanker algorithm, which delves into the robustness of pivotal features embedded within cough audios. The CoughFeatureRanker algorithm selects the most prominent features based on their optimal discriminatory performance from 15 features to detect COVID-19. The effectiveness of the CoughFeatureRanker algorithm within the ensemble framework is scrutinized, confirming its favorable influence on the accuracy of COVID-19 detection. The Cough2COVID-19 (MLEDL) framework achieves remarkable outcomes in COVID-19 detection through cough audio signals, boasting a specificity of 98%, sensitivity of 97%, accuracy of 98%, and an AUC score of 0.981. Our framework asserts its supremacy in precise non-invasive screening through an exhaustive comparison with cutting-edge methodologies. This groundbreaking innovation holds the potential to enhance urban resilience by transforming disease diagnosis, offering a significant approach to curtailing transmission risks and facilitating timely interventions in the ongoing battle against the pandemic."

Here, we present an FDA-cleared, artificial intelligence (AI) system which uses a deep learning algorithm to assist physicians in the comprehensive detection and localization of abnormalities on chest X-rays. We trained and tested the AI system on a large dataset, assessed generalizability on publicly available data, and evaluated radiologist and non-radiologist physician accuracy when unaided and aided by the AI system. The AI system accurately detected chest X-ray abnormalities (AUC: 0.976, 95% bootstrap CI: 0.975, 0.976) and generalized to a publicly available dataset (AUC: 0.975, 95% bootstrap CI: 0.971, 0.978). Physicians showed significant improvements in detecting abnormalities on chest X-rays when aided by the AI system compared to when unaided (difference in AUC: 0.101, p < 0.001). Non-radiologist physicians detected abnormalities on chest X-ray exams as accurately as radiologists when aided by the AI system and were faster at evaluating chest X-rays when aided compared to unaided. Together, these results show that the AI system is accurate and reduces physician errors in chest X-ray evaluation, which highlights the potential of AI systems to improve access to fast, high-quality radiograph interpretation."

        "abstract": "Morphology of right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) is potentially related to cardiovascular outcomes. However, this relationship still remains to be verified with direct evidence. We retrospectively reviewed cases from the autopsy specimen library in the Center of Forensic Medicine in Sun Yat-sen University from 2017 to 2023. Six RVOT morphological characteristics were measured and their association with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), sudden cardiac death (SCD) and age at death was evaluated. Relationship between myocardial fibrosis in RVOT and CVDs was investigated. RVOT characteristics were recruited by machine learning algorithms for diagnosing CVDs. A total of 2370 cases were finally recruited. Perimeter of sub-valve plane (pSBV) in RVOT was positively associated with risk of CVDs and SCD (OR: 1.21, 95%CI: 1.07–1.37, p = 0.003; OR: 1.33, 95%CI: 1.16–1.52, p < 0.001). Compared with thickness of septum (tS) < 3.0 mm, tS ≥ 3.0 mm was associated with premature death in disease-dominant death (β=-0.16, 95%CI: -0.20 to -0.11, p < 0.001) and SCD (β=-0.15, 95%CI: -0.21 to -0.10, p < 0.001). Degree of myocardial fibrosis in the posterior septum was increased in coronary atherosclerosis (6.86%±2.48% vs. 4.91%±2.14%, p = 0.011) and cardiomyopathies (8.11%±3.24% vs. 4.88%±3.11%, p = 0.005). A logistic regression model, recruiting age, left and right ventricular wall thickness, pSBV, circumference of pulmonary annulus and aortic annulus, was elected as an optimal diagnostic model of CVDs, yielding AUC of 0.734 (95%CI: 0.705–0.763), 0.781 (0.740–0.821) and 0.763 (0.725-0.800) in training, validation and test sets. Increased pSBV significantly correlates with higher risk of CVDs and SCD. And tS ≥ 3.0 mm is an independent risk factor of premature death regardless of diseases."

While computed tomography (CT) scan data are known predictors of PMI, no machine learning (ML) model integrating CT with clinical, ECG, and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) data has been proposed. This study investigates the contribution of ML methods to predict PMI after TAVI, with a focus on the role of CT imaging data. A retrospective analysis was conducted on a cohort of 520 patients who underwent TAVI. Recursive feature elimination with SHAP values was used to select key variables from clinical, ECG, TTE, and CT data. Six ML models, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), were trained using these selected variables. The model’s performance was evaluated using AUC-ROC, F1 score, and accuracy metrics. The PMI rate was 18.8%. The best-performing model achieved an AUC-ROC of 92.1% ± 4.7, an F1 score of 71.8% ± 9.9, and an accuracy of 87.9% ± 4.7 using 22 variables, 9 of which were CT-based. Membranous septum measurements and their dynamic variations were critical predictors. Our ML model provides robust PMI predictions, enabling personalized risk assessments. The model is implemented online for broad clinical use."

DL-BMD values on L1 and L2 vertebral bodies were compared with manual BMD (m-BMD) measurements using Pearson’s correlation and intraclass correlation coefficients. Strong agreement was found between m-BMD and DL-BMD in total CT scans (r = 0.953, p < 0.001). The diagnostic performance of DL-BMD was assessed using receiver operating characteristic analysis for osteoporosis and low BMD by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and m-BMD. Compared to DXA, DL-BMD demonstrated an AUC of 0.790 (95% CI 0.733–0.839) for low BMD and 0.769 (95% CI 0.710–0.820) for osteoporosis, with sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 80.8% (95% CI 74.2–86.3%), 56.3% (95% CI 43.4–68.6%), and 74.3% (95% CI 68.3–79.7%) for low BMD and 65.4% (95% CI 50.9–78.0%), 70.9% (95% CI 63.8–77.3%), and 69.7% (95% CI 63.5–75.4%) for osteoporosis, respectively.

This retrospective case-control study assessed physiotherapy students’ academic performance and satisfaction with a hybrid classroom approach adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic for teaching airway clearance techniques. Physiotherapy students participated in a ‘Critical area and airway clearance techniques’ seminar in person or remotely. The evaluation included a multiple-choice quiz (0–20 points) for theoretical knowledge, a checklist (0–10 points) for practical skills, and a total score (0–30 points). Satisfaction was measured using a 5-point Likert scale. Quartile regression tests calculated median differences, 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and Cohen’s d effect sizes for each assessment component. The analysis included 41 students (54% men, mean age: 23 ± 2.1). The face-to-face group outperformed the remote group in total scores (median difference: 6 [95% CI 2.89; 9.10], effect size: 1.48 [0.72; 2.23]) and practical skills (median difference: 4 [2.31; 5.68], effect size: 2.05 [1.35; 2.76]). However, there was no conclusive difference in theoretical knowledge (median difference: 2 [-0.24; 4.24], effect size: 0.61 [-0.07; 1.29]). Student satisfaction was similar. Physiotherapy students attending the ‘Critical area and airway clearance techniques’ seminar remotely achieved lower scores than their in-person counterparts, highlighting the potential limitations of hybrid teaching for this subject. The mean scores indicated that this method allowed students to acquire the necessary knowledge during the COVID-19 pandemic."

In Fenland follow-up data, all metrics were predicted with high correlations (r > 0.86). We also evaluate a smartphone app which reconstructs a 3D mesh from phone images to predict body composition metrics; this analysis also showed strong correlations (r > 0.84) for all metrics.

        "abstract": "Since dietary intake is challenging to directly measure in large-scale cohort studies, we often rely on self-reported instruments (e.g., food frequency questionnaires, 24-hour recalls, and diet records) developed in nutritional epidemiology. Those self-reported instruments are prone to measurement errors, which can lead to inaccuracies in the calculation of nutrient profiles. Currently, few computational methods exist to address this problem. In the present study, we introduce a deep-learning approach—Microbiome-based nutrient profile corrector (METRIC), which leverages gut microbial compositions to correct random errors in self-reported dietary assessments using 24-hour recalls or diet records. We demonstrate the excellent performance of METRIC in minimizing the simulated random errors, particularly for nutrients metabolized by gut bacteria in both synthetic and three real-world datasets. Additionally, we find that METRIC can still correct the random errors well even without including gut microbial compositions. Further research is warranted to examine the utility of METRIC to correct actual measurement errors in self-reported dietary assessment instruments."

TB data from 2014 to 2019 were collected from the Unified National Electronic Health System (UNEHS) using retrospective quantitative analysis. SARIMA models were able to capture seasonal variations, with Model 2 exhibiting superior predictive accuracy. Both models showed declining TB incidence and revealed a notable predictive performance evaluated by statistical metrics. In addition, the SIR model calculated the basic reproduction number (\\({R_0}\\)) below 1, indicating a receding epidemic. Models proved the capability of each to accurately capture trends (SARIMA) and provide mathematical insights (SIR) into TB transmission dynamics. This study contributes to the general knowledge of TB transmission dynamics in Kazakhstan thus laying the foundation for more comprehensive studies on TB and control strategies."

To identify differentially expressed cytokines between the deteriorating and recovering phases, we analyzed the Electronic Health Records (EHR) and cytokine profile data in a COVID-19 cohort of 444 infected patients and 145 non-infected healthy individuals. We categorized each patient’s progression into Deterioration Phase (DP) and Recovery Phase (RP) using longitudinal neutrophil, lymphocyte and lactate dehydrogenase levels. A random forest model was built using healthy and severe patients to compute the contribution of each cytokine toward disease progression using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP). SHAP values were used for supervised clustering to identify DP and RP-related samples and their associated cytokines. The identified clusters effectively discriminated DP and RP samples, suggesting that the cytokine profiles differed between deteriorating and recovering health conditions. Especially, CXCL10, GDF15, PTX3, and TNFSF10 were differentially expressed between the DP and RP samples, which are involved in the JAK-STAT, NF-\\(\\kappa\\)B, and MAPK signaling pathways contributing to the inflammatory response.

        "abstract": "Cervical cancer is the fourth most common malignant tumor among women globally, posing a significant threat to women’s health. In 2022, approximately 600,000 new cases were reported, and 340,000 deaths occurred due to cervical cancer. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the preferred imaging method for diagnosing, staging, and evaluating cervical cancer. However, manual segmentation of MRI images is time-consuming and subjective. Therefore, there is an urgent need for automatic segmentation models to identify cervical cancer lesions in MRI scans accurately. All MRIs in our research are from cervical cancer patients diagnosed by pathology at Tongren City People’s Hospital. Strict data selection criteria and clearly defined inclusion and exclusion conditions were established to ensure data consistency and accuracy of research results. The dataset contains imaging data from 122 cervical cancer patients, with each patient having 100 pelvic dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI scans. Annotations were jointly completed by medical professionals from Universiti Putra Malaysia and the Radiology Department of Tongren City People’s Hospital to ensure data accuracy and reliability. Additionally, a novel computer-aided diagnosis model named SwinUNeCCt is proposed. This model incorporates (i) A bidirectional hash-based agent multi-head self-attention mechanism, which optimizes the interaction between local and global features in MRI, aiding in more accurate lesion identification. (ii) Reduced computational complexity of the self-attention mechanism. The effectiveness of the SwinUNeCCt model has been validated through comparisons with state-of-the-art 3D medical models, including nnUnet, TransBTS, nnFormer, UnetR, UnesT, SwinUNetR, and SwinUNeLCsT. In semantic segmentation tasks without a classification module, the SwinUNeCCt model demonstrates excellent performance across multiple key metrics: achieving a 95HD of 6.25, an IoU of 0.669, and a DSC of 0.802, all of which are the best results among the compared models. Simultaneously, SwinUNeCCt strikes a good balance between computational efficiency and model complexity, requiring only 442.7 GFLOPs of computational power and 71.2 M parameters. Furthermore, in semantic segmentation tasks that include a classification module, the SwinUNeCCt model also exhibits powerful recognition capabilities. Although this slightly increases computational overhead and model complexity, its performance surpasses other comparative models. The SwinUNeCCt model demonstrates excellent performance in semantic segmentation tasks, achieving the best results among state-of-the-art 3D medical models across multiple key metrics. It balances computational efficiency and model complexity well, maintaining high performance even with the inclusion of a classification module."

        "abstract": "Clinical prediction models (CPMs) are tools that compute the risk of an outcome given a set of patient characteristics and are routinely used to inform patients, guide treatment decision-making, and resource allocation. Although much hope has been placed on CPMs to mitigate human biases, CPMs may potentially contribute to racial disparities in decision-making and resource allocation. While some policymakers, professional organizations, and scholars have called for eliminating race as a variable from CPMs, others raise concerns that excluding race may exacerbate healthcare disparities and this controversy remains unresolved. The Guidance for Unbiased predictive Information for healthcare Decision-making and Equity (GUIDE) provides expert guidelines for model developers and health system administrators on the transparent use of race in CPMs and mitigation of algorithmic bias across contexts developed through a 5-round, modified Delphi process from a diverse 14-person technical expert panel (TEP). Deliberations affirmed that race is a social construct and that the goals of prediction are distinct from those of causal inference, and emphasized: the importance of decisional context (e.g., shared decision-making versus healthcare rationing); the conflicting nature of different anti-discrimination principles (e.g., anticlassification versus antisubordination principles); and the importance of identifying and balancing trade-offs in achieving equity-related goals with race-aware versus race-unaware CPMs for conditions where racial identity is prognostically informative. The GUIDE, comprising 31 key items in the development and use of CPMs in healthcare, outlines foundational principles, distinguishes between bias and fairness, and offers guidance for examining subgroup invalidity and using race as a variable in CPMs. This GUIDE presents a living document that supports appraisal and reporting of bias in CPMs to support best practice in CPM development and use."

The evaluation of the proposed algorithm was assessed using an available EEG dataset that applied preprocessing techniques, including scaling, normalization, and elimination of null values. The MBER algorithm’s binary format is specifically designed to select features that can significantly enhance the accuracy of classification. The proposed algorithm and competing ones, namely, Al-Biruni Earth Radius (BER), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Whale Optimization Algorithm (WAO), Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) were evaluated using predefined sets of assessment criteria. The statistical analysis employed the ANOVA and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and assessed the effectiveness and significance of the proposed algorithm compared to the other five algorithms. Furthermore, A series of visual depictions were presented to validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm. Thus, the MBER algorithm outperformed the other optimizers on the majority of the unimodal benchmark functions due to these considerations. Different ML models were used for classification, e.g., DT, RF, KNN, SGD, GNB, SVC, and LR. The KNN model achieved the highest values of Precision (PPV) (0.959425), Negative Predictive Value (NPV) (0.964969), FScore (0.963431), accuracy (0.9612), Sensitivity (0.970578) and Specificity (0.949711). Thus, KNN serves as a fitness function and is optimized by the utilization of Modified Al-Biruni earth radius (MBER). Finally, the accuracy of eye state classification achieved 96.12% using the proposed algorithm."

        "abstract": "Current machine learning methods for medical image analysis primarily focus on developing models tailored for their specific tasks, utilizing data within their target domain. These specialized models tend to be data-hungry and often exhibit limitations in generalizing to out-of-distribution samples. In this work, we show that employing models that incorporate multiple domains instead of specialized ones significantly alleviates the limitations observed in specialized models. We refer to this approach as multi-domain model and compare its performance to that of specialized models. For this, we introduce the incorporation of diverse medical image domains, including different imaging modalities like X-ray, MRI, CT, and ultrasound images, as well as various viewpoints such as axial, coronal, and sagittal views. Our findings underscore the superior generalization capabilities of multi-domain models, particularly in scenarios characterized by limited data availability and out-of-distribution, frequently encountered in healthcare applications. The integration of diverse data allows multi-domain models to utilize information across domains, enhancing the overall outcomes substantially. To illustrate, for organ recognition, multi-domain model can enhance accuracy by up to 8% compared to conventional specialized models."

        "abstract": "Valvular Heart Disease (VHD) is a globally significant cause of mortality, particularly among aging populations. Despite advancements in percutaneous and surgical interventions, there are still uncertainties that remain regarding the risk factors that significantly contribute to this condition within the domain of cardiovascular disease. This study investigates these uncertainties and the role of machine learning in categorizing VHD based on cardiovascular risk factors. It follows a two-part investigation comprising feature extraction and classification phases. Feature extraction is initially performed using a wrapping approach and refined further with binary logistic regression. The second phase employs five classifiers: Artificial Neural Network (ANN), XGBoost, Random Forest (RF), Naïve Bayes, and Support Vector Machine (SVM), along with advanced methods such as SVM combined with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and a majority-voting ensemble method (MV5). Data on VHD cases were collected from DHQ Hospital Faisalabad using simple random sampling. Various statistical measures, such as the ROC curve, F-measure, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, MCC, and Kappa are applied to assess the results. The findings reveal that the combination of SVM with PCA achieves the highest overall performance while the MV5 ensemble method also demonstrates high accuracy and balance in sensitivity and specificity. The variation in VHD prevalence linked to specific risk factors highlights the importance of a comprehensive approach to reduce this disease’s burden. The Exceptional performance of SVM + PCA and MV5 highlights their significance in diagnosing VHD and advancing knowledge in biomedicine."

        "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the influence of various sperm quality characteristics, including morphology, motility, and count, on the success rates of clinical pregnancy achieved through assisted reproductive technologies (ART) such as in-vitro fertilization (IVF), intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), and intrauterine insemination (IUI). The secondary objective was to assess the impact of these sperm parameters on the clinical pregnancy rate that resulted in the detection of a fetal heartbeat during the 11th week of gestation, a crucial milestone in successful ART-derived pregnancies. The researchers employed a retrospective analysis, evaluating data from 734 couples undergoing IVF/ICSI and 1197 couples undergoing IUI across two infertility centers. Exclusion criteria included cases involving donated eggs or sperm, surrogate uteri, and infertile couples with combined male and female factors. Five ensemble machine-learning models were utilized to predict the clinical pregnancy success rates. The Random Forest (RF) model achieved the highest mean accuracy (0.72) and area under the curve (AUC) (0.80), outperforming the other models for both IVF/ICSI and IUI procedures. The Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) value analysis revealed that for IUI cycles, all three sperm parameters (morphology, motility, and count) had significant negative impacts on the prediction of clinical pregnancy success. In contrast, for IVF/ICSI cycles, sperm motility had a positive effect, while sperm morphology and count were negative factors. In cycles with 1 to 5 retrieved eggs, sperm motility, and count, they positively affected the clinical pregnancy rate. The study also identified cut-off values for sperm count, with 54 and 35 being the respective thresholds for IVF/ICSI and IUI. Additionally, a significant cut-off point 30 was found for the sperm morphology parameter across all procedures. This study underscores the immense potential of leveraging ensemble machine learning models with traditional sperm quality assessments. This integrated approach can elevate the precision and personalization of clinical decision-making in the field of assisted reproductive technologies, ultimately offering more hope and better outcomes for couples struggling with infertility."

        "abstract": "The scarcity of organ donors relative to the number of patients with End Stage Kidney Disease (ESKD) has led to prolonged waiting times for kidney transplants, contributing to elevated cardiovascular mortality risk. Transplant professionals are tasked with the complex allocation of limited organs to a vulnerable patient group facing heightened morbidity and mortality risk. The need for continuous re-evaluation of waitlisted patients is evident due to the significant number who perish while awaiting transplantation. Among individuals with ESKD, vascular calcification, particularly Abdominal Arterial Calcifications (AAC), holds predictive value for cardiovascular events and mortality. However, a standardized method to quantify AAC’s prognostic potential remains lacking, especially for kidney transplant evaluations. This study presents an ensemble machine learning (ML) approach to study the relationship between AAC score and mortality in patients on the waitlist and triage patients needing transplantation. Using the AAC score, the proposed ML model can predict kidney transplant waitlist morality with an accuracy of 78% while its accuracy is 68% without using this score. This study leverages explainable ML to explore the relationship between predictors and mortality in waitlisted patients, aiming to improve patient triage accuracy."

In the present study we sought to determine if radiomic features can characterize the adverse effects caused by normal tissue injury as well as identify if human embryonic stem cell (hESC) derived extracellular vesicle (EV) treatment can resolve certain adverse complications. A cohort of 72 mice (n = 12 per treatment group) were exposed to X-ray radiation to the whole lung (3 × 8 Gy) or to the apex of the right lung (3 × 12 Gy), immediately followed by retro-orbital injection of EVs. Cone-Beam Computed Tomography images were acquired before and 2 weeks after treatment. In total, 851 radiomic features were extracted from the whole lungs and < 20 features were selected to train and validate a series of random forest classification models trained to predict radiation status, EV status and treatment group. It was found that all three classification models achieved significantly high prediction accuracies on a validation subset of the dataset (AUCs of 0.91, 0.86 and 0.80 respectively). In the locally irradiated lung, a significant difference between irradiated and unirradiated groups as well as an EV sparing effect were observed in several radiomic features that were not seen in the unirradiated lung (including wavelet-LLH Kurtosis, wavelet HLL Large Area High Gray Level Emphasis, and Gray Level Non-Uniformity). Additionally, a radiation difference was not observed in a secondary comparison cohort, but there was no impact of imaging machine parameters on the radiomic signature of unirradiated mice. Our data demonstrate that radiomics has the potential to identify radiation-induced lung injury and could be applied to predict therapeutic efficacy at early timepoints."

Using EHR data for all patients over 18 with a visit between 1/1/2017 and 10/2/2021, we developed a model for the risk of a suicide attempt or death in the 90 days following a visit. Features included demographics, medications, diagnoses, and scores from relevant screening tools. We compared the predictive performance of logistic regression and random forest models against existing suicide screening, which was augmented to include the history of previous attempts or ideation. During the study, 16,835 patients had 331,588 visits, with 490 attempts and 37 deaths by suicide. The logistic regression and random forest models (area under the ROC (AUROC) 0.83 [0.80–0.86]; both models) performed better than enhanced screening (AUROC 0.64 [0.61–0.67]). These results suggest that an EHR-based suicide risk model can add value to existing practices at Indian Health Service clinics."

Patients with TEN undergo severe and sudden epidermal detachment caused by keratinocyte cell death. Although molecular mechanisms that drive keratinocyte cell death have been proposed, the main drivers remain unknown, and there is no effective therapy for TEN4,5,6. Here, to systematically map molecular changes that are associated with TEN and identify potential druggable targets, we utilized deep visual proteomics, which provides single-cell-based, cell-type-resolution proteomics7,8. We analysed formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archived skin tissue biopsies of three types of cutaneous drug reactions with varying severity and quantified more than 5,000 proteins in keratinocytes and skin-infiltrating immune cells. This revealed a marked enrichment of type I and type II interferon signatures in the immune cell and keratinocyte compartment of patients with TEN, as well as phosphorylated STAT1 activation. Targeted inhibition with the pan-JAK inhibitor tofacitinib in vitro reduced keratinocyte-directed cytotoxicity. In vivo oral administration of tofacitinib, baricitinib or the JAK1-specific inhibitors abrocitinib or upadacitinib ameliorated clinical and histological disease severity in two distinct mouse models of TEN. Crucially, treatment with JAK inhibitors (JAKi) was safe and associated with rapid cutaneous re-epithelialization and recovery in seven patients with TEN. This study uncovers the JAK/STAT and interferon signalling pathways as key pathogenic drivers of TEN and demonstrates the potential of targeted JAKi as a curative therapy."

This split-face study investigated mask-related changes in skin barrier function and microbiome composition among 30 female volunteers with sensitive skin and assessed the mitigating effects of a moisturizer containing biological lipids and probiotics. Skin physiological indicators (transepidermal water loss, erythema index, stratum corneum hydration, pH, temperature) of masked and unmasked areas were collected at baseline, after three hours of mask-wearing, post-tape stripping, and after 24 h, respectively. Microbiome samples collected from the masked areas before and after wearing a medical mask were analyzed with bioinformatics methods. Mask-wearing significantly weakened barrier function in both masked and adjacent unmasked areas, while reducing bacterial diversity. It was also associated with an increase in Cutibacterium (P = 0.110) and decreases in Streptococcus (P = 0.032) and Prevotella (P = 0.026) abundance. Moisturizer application prior to mask-wearing significantly reduced transepidermal water loss and erythema (both P < 0.001) and further improved erythema after 24 h (P = 0.048). These findings demonstrate that mask-wearing can disrupt the skin barrier and microbiome in individuals with sensitive skin and applying a moisturizer beforehand can mitigate mask-related discomforts by aiding barrier repair and reducing sensitivity."

The participants were randomly divided into a training set and a testing set in a 7:3 ratio. Firstly, in the training set, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and multivariate logistic regression were performed to select variables that were used to establish a nomogram. Then, the receiver operating curves (ROC) and calibration curves were plotted to assess the model’s discriminative ability and performance. A total of 2563 neurologically healthy participants were enrolled. According to LASSO-Logistic regression analysis, age, fasting blood glucose (FBG), systolic blood pressure (SBP), hypertension, and carotid atherosclerosis (CAS) were significantly associated with aICAS in the multivariable model (adjusted P < 0.005). The area under the ROC of the training and testing sets was, respectively, 0.78 (95% CI: 0.73–0.82) and 0.65 (95% CI: 0.56–0.73). The calibration curves showed good homogeneity between the predicted and actual values. The nomogram, consisting of age, FBG, SBP, hypertension, and CAS, can accurately predict aICAS risk in a neurologically healthy population."

In this study, a deep learning model utilizing a 3D ResNet-18 network was trained to predict chronological age from LC-OCT images of 100 healthy Caucasian female volunteers, aged 20 to 70 years. The AI-based protocol focused on regions of interest delineated between the segmented dermal-epidermal junction and the superficial dermis, exploiting complex patterns within the collagen network for age prediction. The model achieved a mean absolute error of 4.2 years and exhibited a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.937 with actual ages. Furthermore, there was a notable correlation (r = 0.87) between quantified clinical scoring, encompassing parameters such as firmness, elasticity, density, and wrinkle appearance, and the ages predicted by deep learning model. This strong correlation underscores how integrating emerging imaging technologies with deep learning can accelerate aging research and deepen our understanding of how alterations in skin microstructure are related to visible signs of aging."

Pathologists from nine centers were trained to quantify epithelial tumor cells, tumor-associated stromal cells, and non-neoplastic cells from NSCLC WSI using QuPath. Then, we conducted two consecutive ring trials. In the first trial, analyzing four WSI, reliability between pathologists in the assessment of tumor cell percentage was poor (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) 0.09). After performing the first ring trial pathologists received feedback. The second trial, comprising 10 WSI with paired next-generation sequencing results, also showed poor reliability (ICC 0.24). Cases near the recommended 20% visual threshold for molecular techniques exhibited higher values with digital analysis. In the second ring trial reliability slightly improved and human errors were reduced from 5.6% to 1.25%. Most discrepancies arose from subjective tasks, such as the annotation process, suggesting potential improvement with future artificial intelligence solutions."

Traditionally, the intelligibility of vocoder CI simulations is assessed through speech recognition experiments with normally-hearing subjects, a process that can be time-consuming, costly, and subject to individual variability. As an alternative approach, we utilized an advanced deep learning speech recognition model to investigate the intelligibility of CI simulations. We evaluated model’s performance on vocoder-processed words and sentences with varying vocoder parameters. The number of vocoder bands, frequency range, and envelope dynamic range were adjusted to simulate sound processing settings in CI devices. Additionally, we manipulated the low-cutoff frequency and intensity quantization of vocoder envelopes to simulate psychophysical temporal and intensity resolutions in CI patients. The results were evaluated within the context of the audio analysis performed in the model. Interestingly, the deep learning model, despite not being originally designed to mimic human speech processing, exhibited a human-like response to alterations in vocoder parameters, resembling existing human subject results. This approach offers significant time and cost savings compared to testing human subjects, and eliminates learning and fatigue effects during testing. Our findings demonstrate the potential of speech recognition models in facilitating auditory research."

Patients were randomly divided into a training set (70%) and a validation set (30%). Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression and multivariate logistic regression were employed to identify significant predictors of 1-year mortality, which were then used to develop a prognostic nomogram. The model’s discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility were assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), calibration plots, and decision curve analysis, respectively. A total of 3,882 SAE patients were included in the analysis.

Our dataset included 5211 OCT scans from 344 eyes of 255 patients diagnosed with CSCR. 178 eyes were identified as recurrent, 109 as non-recurrent, and 57 were excluded. We extracted parameters using artificial intelligence algorithms based on U-Nets, convolutional kernels, and morphological operators. We applied inferential statistics to evaluate differences between the recurrent and non-recurrent groups, and we used a logistic regression predictive model, reporting the coefficients as a measure of biomarker importance. We identified nine predictive biomarkers for CSCR recurrence: age, intraretinal fluid, subretinal fluid, pigment epithelial detachments, choroidal vascularity index, integrity of photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelium layer, choriocapillaris and choroidal stroma thickness, and thinning of the outer nuclear layer, and of the inner nuclear layer combined with the outer plexiform layer.

This study employed eight advanced machine learning algorithms to predict the status of micronutrient supplementation among pregnant women in 12 East African countries, using recent demographic health survey (DHS) data. The analysis involved 138,426 study samples, and algorithm performance was evaluated using accuracy, area under the ROC curve (AUC), specificity, precision, recall, and F1-score. Among the algorithms tested, the random forest classifier emerged as the top performer in predicting micronutrient supplementation status, exhibiting excellent evaluation scores (AUC = 0.892 and accuracy = 94.0%). By analyzing mean SHAP values and performing association rule mining, we gained valuable insights into the importance of different variables and their combined impact, revealing hidden patterns within the data. Key predictors of micronutrient supplementation were the mother’s education level, employment status, number of antenatal care (ANC) visits, access to media, number of children, and religion. By harnessing the power of machine learning algorithms, policymakers and healthcare providers can develop targeted strategies to improve the uptake of micronutrient supplementation. Key intervention components involve enhancing education, strengthening ANC services, and implementing comprehensive media campaigns that emphasize the importance of micronutrient supplementation. It is also crucial to consider cultural and religious sensitivities when designing interventions to ensure their effectiveness and acceptance within the specific population. Furthermore, researchers are encouraged to explore and experiment with various techniques to optimize algorithm performance, leading to the identification of the most effective predictors and enhanced accuracy in predicting micronutrient supplementation status."

The data is divided into three sets: 90% for training and 5% each for testing and validation. The correctness and effectiveness of the proposed neural network model have been assessed using various evaluation metrics. The metrics have been used in this study are Mean Square Error (MSE), histogram errors, and regression plots.

Radiomics features were extracted from grey-matter and white-matter in the filtered mwp0* image. The Mann-Whitney U test, Spearman’s rank correlation test, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) were utilized to select features. An XGBoost model was created based on these features, and Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) was used for personalization and visual interpretation. A nomogram was developed for the diagnosis of FMS subgroups, utilizing radiomics scores and clinical predictors. The efficacy of the nomogram was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, while decision curve analysis was employed to evaluate its clinical efficacy. The XGBoost model displays stability in the training validation group, indicating lower overfitting of CP model. The nomogram model combined with the rad-score has a greater ability to distinguish between typical and sub-clinical than the clinical factor model alone.

        "abstract": "COVID-19 has a higher rate of morbidity and mortality among dialysis patients than the general population. Identifying infected patients early with the support of predictive models helps dialysis centers implement concerted procedures (e.g., temperature screenings, universal masking, isolation treatments) to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and mitigate outbreaks. We collect data from multiple sources, including demographics, clinical, treatment, laboratory, vaccination, socioeconomic status, and COVID-19 surveillance. Previous early prediction models, such as logistic regression, SVM, and XGBoost, require sophisticated feature engineering and need improved prediction performance. We create deep learning models, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), to predict SARS-CoV-2 infections during incubation. Our study shows deep learning models with minimal feature engineering can identify those infected patients more accurately than previously built models. Our Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model consistently performed well, with an AUC exceeding 0.80, peaking at 0.91 in August 2021. The CNN model also demonstrated strong results with an AUC above 0.75. Both models outperformed previous best XGBoost models by over 0.10 in AUC. Prediction accuracy declined as the pandemic evolved, dropping to approximately 0.75 between September 2021 and January 2022. Maintaining a 20% false positive rate, our LSTM and CNN models identified 66% and 64% of positive cases among patients, significantly outperforming XGBoost models at 42%. We also identify key features for dialysis patients by calculating the gradient of the output with respect to the input features. By closely monitoring these factors, dialysis patients can receive earlier diagnoses and care, leading to less severe outcomes. Our research highlights the effectiveness of deep neural networks in analyzing longitudinal data, especially in predicting COVID-19 infections during the crucial incubation period. These deep network approaches surpass traditional methods relying on aggregated variable means, significantly improving the accurate identification of SARS-CoV-2 infections."

In our study, we used UK Biobank data to find the genetic determinants of COVID-19 vaccine-induced seropositivity and breakthrough infections. We conducted four genome-wide association studies among vaccinated participants for COVID-19 vaccine seroconversion and breakthrough susceptibility and severity. Our findings confirmed a link between the HLA region and seroconversion after the first and second doses. Additionally, we identified 10 genomic regions associated with breakthrough infection (SLC6A20, ST6GAL1, MUC16, FUT6, MXI1, MUC4, HMGN2P18-KRTCAP2, NFKBIZ and APOC1), and one with breakthrough severity (APOE). No significant evidence of genetic colocalisation was found between those traits. Our study highlights the roles of individual genetic make-up in the varied antibody responses to COVID-19 vaccines and provides insights into the potential mechanisms behind breakthrough infections occurred even after the vaccination."

Due to its rapid progression, early detection is essential; however, definitive diagnosis requires invasive kidney biopsy. This study aims to develop non-invasive predictive models for diagnosing MCD by machine learning. We retrospectively collected data on demographic characteristics, blood tests, and urine tests from patients with nephrotic syndrome who underwent kidney biopsy. We applied four machine learning algorithms—TabPFN, LightGBM, Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Network—and logistic regression. We compared their performance using stratified 5-repeated 5-fold cross-validation for the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC). Variable importance was evaluated using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method. A total of 248 patients were included, with 82 cases (33%) were diagnosed with MCD. TabPFN demonstrated the best performance with an AUROC of 0.915 (95% CI 0.896–0.932) and an AUPRC of 0.840 (95% CI 0.807–0.872). The SHAP methods identified C3, total cholesterol, and urine red blood cells as key predictors for TabPFN, consistent with previous reports. Machine learning models could be valuable non-invasive diagnostic tools for MCD."

Despite its importance, the segmentation process remains an open challenge due to variations in color, texture, shape diversity and boundaries. Semantic segmentation often requires deeper neural networks to achieve higher accuracy, making the segmentation model more complex and slower. Due to the need to process a large number of biomedical images, more efficient and cheaper image processing techniques for accurate segmentation are needed. In this article, we present a modified deep semantic segmentation model that utilizes the backbone of EfficientNet-B3 along with UNet for reliable segmentation. We trained our model on Non-melanoma skin cancer segmentation for histopathology dataset to divide the image in 12 different classes for segmentation. Our method outperforms the existing literature with an increase in average class accuracy from 79 to 83%. Our approach also shows an increase in overall accuracy from 85 to 94%."

A retrospective cross-sectional observational study used a database of 422 patients who underwent cataract surgery at the Oftalvist Center in Almeria between January 2021 and December 2022. A random forest based on machine learning techniques was proposed to classify the importance of preoperative variables for calculating IOL power. Correlations were explored between implanted IOL power and the most important variables in random forests. The importance of each variable was analyzed using the random forest technique, which established a ranking of feature selections based on different criteria. A positive correlation was found with the random forest variables. Selection: axial length (AL), keratometry preoperative, anterior chamber depth (ACD), measured from corneal epithelium to lens, corneal diameter, lens constant, and astigmatism aberration. The variables coma aberration (p-value = 0,12) and macular thickness (p-value = 0,10) were almost slightly significant. In cataract surgery, the implanted IOL power is mainly correlated with axial length, anterior chamber depth, corneal diameter, lens constant, and preoperative keratometry. New variables such as astigmatism and anterior coma aberration and retina variables such as the preoperative central macular thickness could be included in the new generation of biometric formulas based on artificial intelligence techniques."

We validated the model using CT images of anthropomorphic phantoms and one normal individual. The measurement values obtained by our algorithm demonstrated very small differences compared to the known anthropomorphic phantom model data and manual measurement. For algorithm testing, 17,214 chest CT scans obtained from 57 PE patients were processed by the algorithm and independently reviewed by a radiologist and a thoracic surgeon. The measurements of transverse, anteroposterior, and sternum-to-vertebral distance of the thoracic cavity, along with the calculated data of four indices, exhibited high positive correlations (0.94–0.99). The asymmetry index and maximum anteroposterior hemithorax distance exhibited moderate correlation (0.40–0.83). Our automatic PE diagnostic tool demonstrated high accuracy; four chest wall deformity indices were obtained simultaneously without any initial manual marking, correlating well with manual measurements."

Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most common BM source and here we obtained 402 tumor and plasma samples from a large cohort of patients with LUAD with or without BM (n = 346). LUAD DNA methylation signatures were evaluated to build and validate an accurate model predicting BM development from LUAD, which was integrated with clinical factors to provide comprehensive patient-specific BM risk probabilities in a nomogram. Additionally, immune and cell interaction gene sets were differentially methylated at promoters in BM versus paired primary LUAD and had aligning dysregulation in the proteome. Immune cells were differentially abundant in BM versus LUAD. Finally, liquid biomarkers identified from methylated cell-free DNA sequenced in plasma were used to generate and validate accurate classifiers for early BM detection. Overall, LUAD methylomes can be leveraged to predict and noninvasively identify BM, moving toward improved patient outcomes with personalized treatment."

Drug therapy is hampered by large patient variability and partial representation of human MASH fibrosis in preclinical models. Here, we investigated the mechanisms underlying patient heterogeneity using a discovery dataset and validated in distinct human transcriptomic datasets, to improve patient stratification and translation into subgroup specific patterns. Patient stratification was performed using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) in a large public transcriptomic discovery dataset (n = 216). Differential expression analysis was performed using DESeq2 to obtain differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Ingenuity Pathway analysis was used for functional annotation. The discovery dataset showed relevant fibrosis-related mechanisms representative of disease heterogeneity. Biological complexity embedded in genes signature was used to stratify discovery dataset into six subgroups of various sizes. Of note, subgroup-specific DEGs show differences in directionality in canonical pathways (e.g. Collagen biosynthesis, cytokine signaling) across subgroups. Finally, a multiclass classification model was trained and validated in two datasets. In summary, our work shows a potential alternative for patient population stratification based on heterogeneity in MASLD-MASH mechanisms. Future research is warranted to further characterize patient subgroups and identify protein targets for virtual screening and/or in vitro validation in preclinical models."

        "abstract": "With the increasing prevalence of diabetes mellitus worldwide, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) combined with cognitive impairment and aging has become one of the common and important complications of diabetes mellitus, which seriously affects the quality of life of the patients, and imposes a heavy burden on the patients’ families and the society. Currently, there are no special measures for the treatment of cognitive impairment and aging in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Therefore, the search for potential biological markers of type 2 diabetes mellitus combined with cognitive impairment and aging is of great significance for future precisive treatment. We downloaded three gene expression datasets from the GEO database: GSE161355 (related to T2D with cognitive impairment and aging), GSE122063, and GSE5281 (related to Alzheimer’s disease). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, followed by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using the STRING database, and the top 15 hub genes were identified using the CytoHubba plugin in Cytoscape. Core genes were ultimately determined using three machine learning methods: LASSO regression, Support Vector Machine Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). The diagnostic performance of these genes was assessed using ROC curve analysis and validated in an independent dataset (GSE5281). Regulatory genes related to ferroptosis were screened from the FerrDb database, and their biological functions were further explored through GO and KEGG enrichment analyses. Finally, the CIBERSORT algorithm was used to analyze immune cell infiltration, and the correlation between core genes and immune cell infiltration levels was calculated, leading to the construction of an mRNA-miRNA regulatory network. In the GSE161355 and GSE122063 datasets, 217 common DEGs were identified. GSEA analysis revealed their enrichment in the PI3K-PLC-TRK signaling pathway, TP53 regulation of metabolic genes pathway, Notch signaling pathway, among others. PPI network analysis identified 15 candidate core genes, and further selection using LASSO, LDA, and SVM-RFE machine learning algorithms resulted in 6 core genes: BCL6, TP53, HSP90AA1, CRYAB, IL1B, and DNAJB1. ROC curve analysis indicated that these genes had good diagnostic performance in the GSE161355 dataset, with TP53 and IL1B achieving an AUC of 0.9, indicating the highest predictive accuracy. BCL6, HSP90AA1, CRYAB, and DNAJB1 also had AUCs greater than 0.8, demonstrating moderate predictive accuracy. Validation in the independent dataset GSE5281 showed that these core genes also had good diagnostic performance in Alzheimer’s disease samples (AUC > 0.6). Ferroptosis-related analysis revealed that IL1B and TP53 play significant roles in apoptosis and immune response. Immune cell infiltration analysis showed that IL1B is significantly positively correlated with infiltration levels of monocytes and NK cells, while TP53 is significantly negatively correlated with infiltration levels of follicular helper T cells. The construction of the miRNA-mRNA regulatory network suggested that miR-150a-5p might play a key role in the regulation of T2D-associated cognitive impairment and aging by TP53. This study, by integrating bioinformatics and machine learning methods, identified BCL6, TP53, HSP90AA1, CRYAB, IL1B, and DNAJB1 as potential diagnostic biomarkers for T2D with cognitive impairment and aging, with a particular emphasis on the significance of TP53 and IL1B in immune cell infiltration. These findings not only enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms linking type 2 diabetes to cognitive impairment and aging, providing new targets for early diagnosis and treatment, but also offer new directions and targets for basic research."

The global health emergency called for unprecedented efforts to monitor and reduce the rate of infection, pushing the study of new diagnostic methods. In this paper, we introduce a cheap, fast, and non-invasive COVID-19 detection system, which exploits only exhaled breath. Specifically, provided an air sample, the mass spectra in the 10–351 mass-to-charge range are measured using an original micro and nano-sampling device coupled with a high-precision spectrometer; then, the raw spectra are processed by custom software algorithms; the clean and augmented data are eventually classified using state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithms. An uncontrolled clinical trial was conducted between 2021 and 2022 on 302 subjects who were concerned about being infected, either due to exhibiting symptoms or having recently recovered from illness. Despite the simplicity of use, our system showed a performance comparable to the traditional polymerase-chain-reaction and antigen testing in identifying cases of COVID-19 (that is, 95% accuracy, 94% recall, 96% specificity, and 92% \\(F_1\\)-score). In light of these outcomes, we think that the proposed system holds the potential for substantial contributions to routine screenings and expedited responses during future epidemics, as it yields results comparable to state-of-the-art methods, providing them in a more rapid and less invasive manner."

We propose a machine learning analytic pipeline to calculate the individualized polysocial risk score (iPsRS), which can identify T2D patients at high social risk for hospitalization, incorporating explainable AI techniques and algorithmic fairness optimization. We use electronic health records (EHR) data from T2D patients in the University of Florida Health Integrated Data Repository, incorporating both contextual SDoH (e.g., neighborhood deprivation) and person-level SDoH (e.g., housing instability). After fairness optimization across racial and ethnic groups, the iPsRS achieved a C statistic of 0.71 in predicting 1-year hospitalization. Our iPsRS can fairly and accurately screen patients with T2D who are at increased social risk for hospitalization."

Regulatory T cells were also enriched and displayed enhanced inhibitory functions. Within the CD8 + T-cell subset, effector memory/tissue-resident memory T cells with an elevated cytotoxic phenotype were highly infiltrated. Among myeloid cells, alveolar macrophages were depleted, while pro-inflammatory intermediate monocytes were elevated. Dendritic cells demonstrated enhanced antigen presentation capabilities. Cytokines CXCR4, CXCL13, TNF-α, IFN-α, IFN-γ, and TWEAK were elevated. Through a comprehensive single-cell analysis, we depicted the landscape of immune checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis."

Here we find that 73% of 162 gene mutations recurrent in Black patients, including a hitherto unreported PHIP alteration detected in 7% of patients, were found in one white patient or not detected. Black patients with myelodysplasia-related AML were younger than white patients suggesting intrinsic and/or extrinsic dysplasia-causing stressors. On multivariable analyses of Black patients, NPM1 and NRAS mutations were associated with inferior disease-free and IDH1 and IDH2 mutations with reduced overall survival. Inflammatory profiles, cell type distributions and transcriptional profiles differed between Black and white patients with NPM1 mutations.

        "abstract": "Identification of retinal diseases in automated screening methods, such as those used in clinical settings or computer-aided diagnosis, usually depends on the localization and segmentation of the Optic Disc (OD) and fovea. However, this task is difficult since these anatomical features have irregular spatial, texture, and shape characteristics, limited sample sizes, and domain shifts due to different data distributions across datasets. This study proposes a novel Multiresolution Cascaded Attention U-Net (MCAU-Net) model that addresses these problems by optimally balancing receptive field size and computational efficiency. The MCAU-Net utilizes two skip connections to accurately localize and segment the OD and fovea in fundus images. We incorporated a Multiresolution Wavelet Pooling Module (MWPM) into the CNN at each stage of U-Net input to compensate for spatial information loss. Additionally, we integrated a cascaded connection of the spatial and channel attentions as a skip connection in MCAU-Net to concentrate precisely on the target object and improve model convergence for segmenting and localizing OD and fovea centers. The proposed model has a low parameter count of 0.8 million, improving computational efficiency and reducing the risk of overfitting. For OD segmentation, the MCAU-Net achieves high IoU values of 0.9771, 0.945, and 0.946 for the DRISHTI-GS, DRIONS-DB, and IDRiD datasets, respectively, outperforming previous results for all three datasets. For the IDRiD dataset, the MCAU-Net locates the OD center with an Euclidean Distance (ED) of 16.90 pixels and the fovea center with an ED of 33.45 pixels, demonstrating its effectiveness in overcoming the common limitations of state-of-the-art methods."

        "abstract": "Recent studies showed that the likelihood of drug approval can be predicted with clinical data and structure information of drug using computational approaches. Predicting the likelihood of drug approval can be innovative and of high impact. However, models that leverage clinical data are applicable only in clinical stages, which is not very practical. Prioritizing drug candidates and early-stage decision-making in the de novo drug development process is crucial in pharmaceutical research to optimize resource allocation. For early-stage decision-making, we need a computational model that uses only chemical structures. This seemingly impossible task may utilize the predictive power with multi-modal features including clinical data. In this work, we introduce ChemAP (Chemical structure-based drug Approval Predictor), a novel deep learning scheme for drug approval prediction in the early-stage drug discovery phase. ChemAP aims to enhance the possibility of early-stage decision-making by enriching semantic knowledge to fill in the gap between multi-modal and single-modal chemical spaces through knowledge distillation techniques. This approach facilitates the effective construction of chemical space solely from chemical structure data, guided by multi-modal knowledge related to efficacy, such as clinical trials and patents of drugs. In this study, ChemAP achieved state-of-the-art performance, outperforming both traditional machine learning and deep learning models in drug approval prediction, with AUROC and AUPRC scores of 0.782 and 0.842 respectively on the drug approval benchmark dataset. Additionally, we demonstrated its generalizability by outperforming baseline models on a recent external dataset, which included drugs from the 2023 FDA-approved list and the 2024 clinical trial failure drug list, achieving AUROC and AUPRC scores of 0.694 and 0.851. These results demonstrate that ChemAP is an effective method in predicting drug approval only with chemical structure information of drug so that decision-making can be done at the early stages of drug development process. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first of its kind to show that prediction of drug approval is possible only with structure information of drug by defining the chemical space of approved and unapproved drugs using deep learning technology."

The top PC was significantly correlated with infiltration (Spearman R: 0·72, p < 0·0001), and adding radiographic PCs significantly improved the discrimination for clinical outcomes (Accuracy: 73 vs 78%, p = 0·014). CNN-derived radiographic lung features therefore add substantial value to the current assessments.

The model’s discrimination was evaluated using a receiver operating characteristic curve, its calibration with a calibration curve, and the results were visualized using the Hosmer–Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test. Thirteen clinical features and fourteen imaging features were selected for constructing the clinical and imaging models. Simultaneously, a set of twenty-five radiomics features were utilized to build the radiomics model. The integrated model demonstrated good calibration and discrimination in the training cohorts (AUC, 0.922; 95% CI: 0.900, 0.942), validation cohorts (AUC, 0.879; 95% CI: 0.806, 0.920), and testing cohorts (AUC, 0.877; 95% CI: 0.836, 0.916). The discriminatory and predictive efficacy of the clinical model in testing cohorts increased further after clinical and radiological features were incorporated (AUC, 0.849 vs. 0.922, P = 0.002). The model demonstrated exemplary predictive efficacy for SMPP by leveraging a comprehensive set of inputs, encompassing clinical data, quantitative and qualitative radiological features, along with radiomics features. The integration of these three aspects in the predictive model further enhanced the performance of the clinical model, indicating the potential for extensive clinical applications."

Target genes of BBR were sifted through TargetNet, CTD, SwissTargetPrediction, and Binding Database. Based on the GSE183795 dataset, DEG analysis, GSEA, and WGCNA were sequentially run to build a disease network. Through sub-network filtration acquired PDAC-related hub genes. A PPI network was established using the shared genes. Degree algorithm from cytoHubba screened the key cluster in the network. Analysis of differential mRNA expression and ROC curves gauged the diagnostic performance of clustered genes. CYBERSORT uncovered the potential role of the key cluster on PDAC immunomodulation. ScRNA-seq analysis evaluated the distribution and expression profile of the key cluster at the single-cell level, assessing enrichment within annotated cell subpopulations to delineate the target distribution of BBR in PDAC. We identified 425 drug target genes and 771 disease target genes, using 57 intersecting genes to construct the PPI network. CytoHubba anchored the top 10 highest contributing genes to be the key cluster. mRNA expression levels and ROC curves confirmed that these genes showed good robustness for PDAC. CYBERSORT revealed that the key cluster influenced immune pathways predominantly associated with Macrophages M0, CD8 T cells, and naïve B cells. ScRNA-seq analysis clarified that BBR mainly acted on epithelial cells and macrophages in PDAC tissues. BBR potentially targets CDK1, CCNB1, CTNNB1, CDK2, TOP2A, MCM2, RUNX2, MYC, PLK1, and AURKA to exert therapeutic effects on PDAC. The mechanisms of action appear to significantly involve macrophage polarization-related immunological responses."

Early and accurate detection is essential for effective intervention. This study aims to enhance the detection and classification of brain tumors in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans using an innovative framework combining Vision Transformer (ViT) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) models. We utilized primary MRI data from Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical College Hospital (BSMMCH) in Faridpur, Bangladesh. Our hybrid ViT-GRU model extracts essential features via ViT and identifies relationships between these features using GRU, addressing class imbalance and outperforming existing diagnostic methods. We extensively processed the dataset, and then trained the model using various optimizers (SGD, Adam, AdamW) and evaluated through rigorous 10-fold cross-validation. Additionally, we incorporated Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques-Attention Map, SHAP, and LIME-to enhance the interpretability of the model’s predictions. For the primary dataset BrTMHD-2023, the ViT-GRU model achieved precision, recall, and F1-score metrics of 97%. The highest accuracies obtained with SGD, Adam, and AdamW optimizers were 81.66%, 96.56%, and 98.97%, respectively. Our model outperformed existing Transfer Learning models by 1.26%, as validated through comparative analysis and cross-validation. The proposed model also shows excellent performances with another Brain Tumor Kaggle Dataset outperforming the existing research done on the same dataset with 96.08% accuracy. The proposed ViT-GRU framework significantly improves the detection and classification of brain tumors in MRI scans. The integration of XAI techniques enhances the model’s transparency and reliability, fostering trust among clinicians and facilitating clinical application. Future work will expand the dataset and apply findings to real-time diagnostic devices, advancing the field."

We investigated the process of sex estimation using silhouette images viewed from different angles and majority votes. A total of 264 PMCT cases (132 cases for each sex) were used for transfer learning with two deep-learning models (AlexNet and VGG16). VGG16 exhibited the highest accuracy (89.8%) for lateral projections. The accuracy improved to 91.7% when implementing a majority vote based on the results of multiple projection angles. Moreover, silhouette images can be obtained from simple and popular X-ray imaging in addition to PMCT. Thus, this study demonstrated the feasibility of sex estimation by combining silhouette images with deep learning. The results implied that X-ray images can be used for personal identification."

        "abstract": "Large-scale Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs) are widely regarded as “the gold standard” for testing the causal effects of school-based interventions. RCTs typically present the statistical significance of the average treatment effect (ATE), which captures the effect an intervention has had on average for a given population. However, key decisions in child health and education are often about individuals who may be very different from those averages. One way to identify heterogeneous treatment effects across different individuals, not captured by the ATE, is to conduct subgroup analyses. For example, free school meal (FSM) pupils as required for projects funded by the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) in England. These subgroup analyses, as we demonstrate in 48 EEF-funded RCTs involving over 200,000 students, are usually not standardised across studies and offer flexible degrees of freedom to researchers, potentially leading to mixed, if not misleading, results. Here, we develop and deploy an alternative to ATE and subgroup analysis, a machine-learning and regression-based framework to predict individualised treatment effects (ITEs). ITEs could show where an intervention worked, for which individuals, and to what extent. Our findings have implications for decision-makers in fields like education, healthcare, law, and clinical practices concerning children and adolescents."

To address these questions, 80 patients with non-small cell lung cancer were enrolled in the biomarker cohort of CheckMate 153 (CA209-153), which collected radiographic guided biopsy samples before treatment and during treatment with nivolumab. Early loss of mutations and neoantigens during therapy are both associated with clinical benefit. We examined 1,453 candidate neoantigens, including many of which that had reduced cancer cell fraction after treatment with nivolumab, and identified 196 neopeptides that were recognized by T cells. Mapping these neoantigens to clonal dynamics, evolutionary trajectories and clinical response revealed a strong selection against immunogenic neoantigen-harboring clones. We identified position-specific amino acid and physiochemical features related to immunogenicity and developed an immunogenicity score. Nivolumab-induced microenvironmental evolution in non-small cell lung cancer shared some similarities with melanoma, yet critical differences were apparent. This study provides unprecedented molecular portraits of neoantigen landscapes underlying nivolumab’s mechanism of action."

The expected values of the negative outcome control (preceding-year hospitalizations) regressed on exposure and negative exposure control (subsequent-year exposure) are treated as a surrogate for omitted confounders. With analyses separately restricted to low-pollution areas (PM2.5 < 9 μg/m³, NO2 < 75.2 µg/m3 [40 ppb], warm-season O3 < 88.2 μg/m3 [45 ppb]), we observed positive associations of the three pollutants with hospitalization rates of stroke, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation and flutter.

Furthermore, it intends to evaluate and compare the predictive performance of a joint model incorporating four types of features with standalone 2.5D deep learning, radiomics, radiology, and clinical models for early expansion in sICH. A total of 254 sICH patients were enrolled retrospectively and divided into two groups according to whether the hematoma was enlarged or not. The 2.5D mask of sICH is constructed with the maximum axial, coronal and sagittal planes of the hematoma, which is used to train the deep learning model and extract deep learning features. Predictive models were built on clinic, radiology, radiomics and deep learning features separately and four type features jointly. The diagnostic performance of each model was measured using the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), Accuracy, Recall, F1 and decision curve analysis (DCA). The AUCs of the clinic model, radiology model, radiomics model, deep learning model, joint model, and nomogram model on the train set (training and Cross-validation) were 0.639, 0.682, 0.859, 0.807, 0.939, and 0.942, respectively, while the AUCs on the test set (external validation) were 0.680, 0.758, 0.802, 0.857, 0.929, and 0.926. Decision curve analysis showed that the joint model was superior to the other models and demonstrated good consistency between the predicted probability of early hematoma expansion and the actual occurrence probability. Our study demonstrates that the joint model is a more efficient and robust prediction model, as verified by multicenter data. This finding highlights the potential clinical utility of a multifactorial prediction model that integrates various data sources for prognostication in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage.

The survival prediction method can be used to effectively analyze the time to event, which is essential in any clinical study. This study aims to bridge the gap between traditional statistical methods and machine learning in survival analysis by revealing which techniques are most effective in predicting survival, with a particular emphasis on improving prediction accuracy and identifying key risk factors for cervical cancer. Women with cervical cancer diagnosed between 2013 and 2015 were included in our study using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Using this dataset, the study assesses the performance of Weibull, Cox proportional hazards models, and Random Survival Forests in terms of predictive accuracy and risk factor identification. The findings reveal that machine learning models, particularly Random Survival Forests (RSF), outperform traditional statistical methods in both predictive accuracy and the discernment of crucial prognostic factors, underscoring the advantages of machine learning in handling complex survival data. However, for a survival dataset with a small number of predictors, statistical models should be used first. The study finds that RSF models enhance survival analysis with more accurate predictions and insights into survival risk factors but highlights the need for larger datasets and further research on model interpretability and clinical applicability."

Improved identification of patient subtypes can enhance early diagnosis and intervention, ultimately leading to better prognostic outcomes for patients. The goal of this study is to identify new immune patterns and biomarkers in patients. Immune subtypes in IPF patients were identified using single-sample gene set enrichment analysis, and immune subtype-related genes were explored using the weighted correlation network analysis algorithm. A machine learning integration framework was used to establish the optimal prognostic model, known as the immune-related risk score (IRS). Single-cell sequencing was conducted to investigate the major role of macrophage-derived PLA2G7 in the immune microenvironment. We assessed the stability of celecoxib in targeting PLA2G7 through molecular docking and surface plasmon resonance. IPF patients present two distinct immune subtypes, one characterized by immune activation and inflammation, and the other by immune suppression. IRS can predict the immune status and prognosis of IPF patients. Furthermore, multi-cohort analysis and single-cell sequencing analysis demonstrated the diagnostic and prognostic value of PLA2G7 derived from macrophages and its role in shaping the inflammatory immune microenvironment in IPF patients. Celecoxib could effectively and stably bind with PLA2G7. PLA2G7, as identified through IRS, demonstrates marked stability in diagnosing and predicting the prognosis of IPF patients as well as predicting their immune status. It can serve as a novel biomarker for IPF patients."

Key predictors of AVP-D included sex, tumor height, preoperative and postoperative changes in sellar diaphragm height and pituitary stalk length, preoperative ACTH levels, changes in ACTH levels, and preoperative cortisol levels. Six machine learning algorithms were tested: logistic regression (LR), support vector classification (SVC), random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). After cross-validation and parameter optimization, the random forest model demonstrated the highest performance, with an accuracy (ACC) of 0.882 and an AUC of 0.96. The decision tree model followed, achieving an accuracy of 0.843 and an AUC of 0.95. Other models showed lower performance: LR had an ACC of 0.522 and an AUC of 0.54; SVC had an ACC of 0.647 and an AUC of 0.67; KNN achieved an ACC of 0.64 and an AUC of 0.70; and XGBoost had an ACC of 0.794 and an AUC of 0.91.

Our research addresses the critical need to understand public sentiment across various dimensions of this crisis by integrating data from multiple modalities, such as text, images, audio, and videos sourced from platforms like Twitter. Conventional methods, which primarily focus on text analysis, often fall short in capturing the nuanced intricacies of emotional states, necessitating a more comprehensive approach. To tackle this challenge, our proposed framework introduces a novel hybrid model, IChOA-CNN-LSTM, which leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for precise image feature extraction, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for sequential data analysis, and an Improved Chimp Optimization Algorithm for effective feature fusion. Remarkably, our model achieves an impressive accuracy rate of 97.8%, outperforming existing approaches in the field. Additionally, by integrating the GeoCoV19 dataset, we facilitate a comprehensive analysis that spans linguistic and geographical boundaries, enriching our understanding of global pandemic discourse and providing critical insights for informed decision-making in public health crises. Through this holistic approach and innovative techniques, our research significantly advances multimodal sentiment analysis, offering a robust framework for deciphering the complex interplay of emotions during unprecedented global challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic."

In contrast to high-income countries (HICs), which often possess the resources and infrastructure to adopt innovative healthcare technologies, LMICs confront resource limitations such as insufficient funding, outdated infrastructure, limited digital data, and a shortage of technical expertise. Consequently, many algorithms initially trained on data from non-LMIC settings are now being employed in LMIC contexts. However, the effectiveness of these systems in LMICs can be compromised when the unique local contexts and requirements are not adequately considered. In this study, we evaluate the feasibility of utilizing models developed in the United Kingdom (a HIC) within hospitals in Vietnam (a LMIC). Consequently, we present and discuss practical methodologies aimed at improving model performance, emphasizing the critical importance of tailoring solutions to the distinct healthcare systems found in LMICs. Our findings emphasize the necessity for collaborative initiatives and solutions that are sensitive to the local context in order to effectively tackle the healthcare challenges that are unique to these regions."

        "abstract": "With over 55 million people globally affected by dementia and nearly 10 million new cases reported annually, Alzheimer’s disease is a prevalent and challenging neurodegenerative disorder. Despite significant advancements in machine learning techniques for Alzheimer’s disease detection, the widespread adoption of deep learning models raises concerns about their explainability. The lack of explainability in deep learning models for online handwriting analysis is a critical gap in the literature in the context of Alzheimer’s disease detection. This paper addresses this challenge by interpreting predictions from a Convolutional Neural Network applied to multivariate time series data, generated by online handwriting data associated with continuous loop series handwritten on a graphical tablet. Our explainability methods reveal distinct motor behavior characteristics for healthy individuals and those diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. Healthy subjects exhibited consistent, smooth movements, while Alzheimer’s patients demonstrated erratic patterns marked by abrupt stops and direction changes. This emphasizes the critical role of explainability in translating complex models into clinically relevant insights. Our research contributes to the enhancement of early diagnosis, providing significant and reliable insights to stakeholders involved in patient care and intervention strategies. Our work bridges the gap between machine learning predictions and clinical insights, fostering a more effective and understandable application of advanced models for Alzheimer’s disease assessment."

        "abstract": "Oral cancer is a global health challenge with a difficult histopathological diagnosis. The accurate histopathological interpretation of oral cancer tissue samples remains difficult. However, early diagnosis is very challenging due to a lack of experienced pathologists and inter- observer variability in diagnosis. The application of artificial intelligence (deep learning algorithms) for oral cancer histology images is very promising for rapid diagnosis. However, it requires a quality annotated dataset to build AI models. We present ORCHID (ORal Cancer Histology Image Database), a specialized database generated to advance research in AI-based histology image analytics of oral cancer and precancer. The ORCHID database is an extensive multicenter collection of high-resolution images captured at 1000X effective magnification (100X objective lens), encapsulating various oral cancer and precancer categories, such as oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF) and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Additionally, it also contains grade-level sub-classifications for OSCC, such as well- differentiated (WD), moderately-differentiated (MD), and poorly-differentiated (PD). The database seeks to aid in developing innovative artificial intelligence-based rapid diagnostics for OSMF and OSCC, along with subtypes."

        "abstract": "Healthy dietary patterns have been linked to a decreased risk of chronic diseases. However, it remains uncertain whether proteomic signatures can reflect proteome response to healthy diet patterns, and whether these proteomic signatures are associated with health outcomes. Using data from the UK Biobank including Olink plasma proteins, we identified substantial proteomic variation in relation to adherence to eight healthy dietary patterns. The proteomic signatures, reflecting adherence and proteome response to healthy dietary patterns, were prospectively associated with lower risks of diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory diseases, chronic kidney diseases and cancers, along with longer life expectancy, even after adjusting for corresponding dietary patterns. These findings suggest proteomic signatures have the potential to complement traditional dietary assessments and deepen our understanding of the relationships between dietary patterns and chronic diseases."

Here we integrate genomic with deep phenomic information to identify modifiable and non-modifiable factors associated with 4,775 plasma proteins in ~8,000 mostly healthy individuals. We create a data-driven map of biological influences on the human plasma proteome and demonstrate segregation of proteins into clusters based on major explanatory factors. For over a third (N = 1,575) of protein targets, joint genetic and non-genetic factors explain 10–77% of the variation in plasma (median 19.88%, interquartile range 14.01–31.09%), independent of technical factors (median 2.48%, interquartile range 0.78–6.41%). Together with genetically anchored causal inference methods, our map highlights potential causal associations between modifiable risk factors and plasma proteins for hundreds of protein–disease associations, for example, COL6A3, which possibly mediates the association between reduced kidney function and cardiovascular disease. We provide a map of biological and technical influences on the human plasma proteome to help contextualize findings from proteomic studies."

        "abstract": "Drug repurposing—identifying new therapeutic uses for approved drugs—is often a serendipitous and opportunistic endeavour to expand the use of drugs for new diseases. The clinical utility of drug-repurposing artificial intelligence (AI) models remains limited because these models focus narrowly on diseases for which some drugs already exist. Here we introduce TxGNN, a graph foundation model for zero-shot drug repurposing, identifying therapeutic candidates even for diseases with limited treatment options or no existing drugs. Trained on a medical knowledge graph, TxGNN uses a graph neural network and metric learning module to rank drugs as potential indications and contraindications for 17,080 diseases. When benchmarked against 8 methods, TxGNN improves prediction accuracy for indications by 49.2% and contraindications by 35.1% under stringent zero-shot evaluation. To facilitate model interpretation, TxGNN’s Explainer module offers transparent insights into multi-hop medical knowledge paths that form TxGNN’s predictive rationales. Human evaluation of TxGNN’s Explainer showed that TxGNN’s predictions and explanations perform encouragingly on multiple axes of performance beyond accuracy. Many of TxGNN’s new predictions align well with off-label prescriptions that clinicians previously made in a large healthcare system. TxGNN’s drug-repurposing predictions are accurate, consistent with off-label drug use, and can be investigated by human experts through multi-hop interpretable rationales."

        "abstract": "The emergence of epigenetic predictors was a pivotal moment in geroscience, propelling the measurement and concept of biological aging into a quantitative era; however, while current epigenetic clocks show strong predictive power, they are data-driven in nature and are not based on the underlying biological mechanisms driving methylation dynamics. We show that predictions of these clocks are susceptible to several confounding non-age-related phenomena that make interpretation of these estimates and associations difficult. To address these limitations, we developed a probabilistic model describing methylation transitions at the cellular level. Our approach reveals two measurable components, acceleration and bias, which directly reflect perturbations of the underlying cellular dynamics. Acceleration is the proportional increase in the speed of methylation transitions across CpG sites, whereas bias corresponds to global changes in methylation levels. Using data from 15,900 participants from the Generation Scotland study, we develop a robust inference framework and show that these are two distinct processes confounding current epigenetic predictors. Our results show improved associations of acceleration and bias with physiological traits known to impact healthy aging, such as smoking and alcohol consumption, respectively. Furthermore, a genome-wide association study of epigenetic age acceleration identified seven genomic loci."

        "abstract": "To predict preterm birth (PTB) in multiparous women, comparing machine learning approaches with traditional logistic regression. A population-based cohort study was conducted using data from the Ontario Better Outcomes Registry and Network (BORN). The cohort included all multiparous women who delivered a singleton birth at 20–42 weeks’ gestation in an Ontario hospital between April 1, 2012 and March 31, 2014. The primary outcome was PTB < 37 weeks, with spontaneous PTB analyzed as a secondary outcome. Stepwise logistic regression and the Boruta machine learning were used to select the important variables during the first and second trimester. For building prediction models, the whole data set were divided for the two independent parts: two-third for training the classifiers (Logistic regression, random forests, decision trees, and artificial neural networks) and one-third for model validation. Then, the training data set were balanced by random over sampling technique. The best hyper parameters were obtained by the tenfold cross validation. The performance of all models was evaluated by sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and the area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUC). The cohort included 145,846 births, of which 8125 (5.57%) were preterm. In first-trimester models, the strongest predictors of PTB were previous PTB, preexisting diabetes, and abnormal pregnancy‐associated plasma protein-A. In the testing data set, the highest predictive ability was seen for artificial neural networks, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 68.8% (95% CI 67.6–70.1%). In second-trimester models, addition of infant sex, attendance at first-trimester appointment, medication exposure, and abnormal alpha-fetoprotein concentrations increased the AUC to 72.1% (95% CI 71.1–73.1%) with logistic regression. With the inclusion of the variable complications during pregnancy, the AUC increased to 80.5% (95% CI 79.6–81.5%) using logistic regression. For both overall and spontaneous PTB, during both the first and second trimesters, models yielded negative predictive values of 97%. Overall, machine learning and logistic regression produced similar performance for prediction of PTB. For overall and spontaneous PTB, both first- and second-trimester models provided negative predictive values of ~ 97%, higher than that of fetal fibronectin."

New therapeutic strategies may emerge from exploring neurodevelopmental and neurophysiological vulnerabilities of glioblastoma. To this end, we systematically screened repurposable neuroactive drugs in glioblastoma patient surgery material using a clinically concordant and single-cell resolved platform. Profiling more than 2,500 ex vivo drug responses across 27 patients and 132 drugs identified class-diverse neuroactive drugs with potent anti-glioblastoma efficacy that were validated across model systems. Interpretable molecular machine learning of drug–target networks revealed neuroactive convergence on AP-1/BTG-driven glioblastoma suppression, enabling expanded in silico screening of more than 1 million compounds with high patient validation accuracy. Deep multimodal profiling confirmed Ca2+-driven AP-1/BTG-pathway induction as a neuro-oncological glioblastoma vulnerability, epitomized by the anti-depressant vortioxetine synergizing with current standard-of-care chemotherapies in vivo. These findings establish an actionable framework for glioblastoma treatment rooted in its neural etiology."

This approach was tested across two drug screening studies and ten cancer types. Kullback-leibler divergence measured the importance of each feature and identified EZH2 gene as a novel biomarker of BRAF inhibitor response. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our MOGP models in accurately predicting dose–responses in different cancer types and when there is a limited number of drug screening experiments for training.

Training on large datasets and producing highly accurate validation results is exceedingly difficult. Furthermore, early and precise diagnosis is necessary due to the increased global prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, the increasing complexity of healthcare datasets makes it challenging to detect feature connections and produce precise predictions. To address these issues, the Intelligent Cardiovascular Disease Diagnosis based on Ant Colony Optimisation with Enhanced Deep Learning (ICVD-ACOEDL) model was developed. This model employs feature selection (FS) and hyperparameter optimization to diagnose CVD. Applying a min–max scaler, medical data is first consistently prepared. The key feature that sets ICVD-ACOEDL apart is the use of Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO) to select an optimal feature subset, which in turn helps to upgrade the performance of the ensuring deep learning enhanced neural network (DLENN) classifier. The model reforms the hyperparameters of DLENN for CVD classification using Bayesian optimization. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark medical datasets show that ICVD-ACOEDL exceeds existing techniques, indicating that it could have a significant impact on CVD diagnosis. The model furnishes a workable way to increase CVD classification efficiency and accuracy in real-world medical situations by incorporating ACO for feature selection, min–max scaling for data pre-processing, and Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tweaking."

A retrospective analysis of 135 TNBC patients (107 responders, 28 non-responders) treated with NAC from January 2015 to October 2022 was conducted. Non-responders were defined according to RECIST guidelines. Data included clinicopathologic factors and clinical MRI findings, with radiomics features from contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images, to train a stacking ensemble of 13 machine learning models. For subgroup analysis, propensity score matching was conducted to adjust for clinical disparities in NAC response. The efficacy of the models was evaluated using the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUROC) before and after matching. The model combining clinicopathologic factors and clinical MRI findings achieved an AUROC of 0.752 (95% CI 0.644–0.860) for predicting non-responders, while radiomics-based models showed 0.749 (95% CI 0.614–0.884).

After propensity score matching, the hierarchical order of key radiomics features remained consistent. Our study demonstrated the potential of using machine learning models based on pretreatment MRI to non-invasively predict TNBC non-responders to NAC."

Various machine learning models, including Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines, were employed to predict patterns of user engagement. The study adopted a two-phase analytical approach. In the first phase, all features of the dataset were included, revealing ‘total_minutes’—the total time participants spent on the intervention and the eHealth platform—as the most significant predictor of engagement. This finding emphasizes the intuitive notion that early time spent on the platform and the intervention is a strong indicator of later user engagement. However, to gain a deeper understanding of engagement beyond this predominant metric, the second phase of the analysis excluded ‘total_minutes’. This approach allowed for the exploration of the roles and interdependencies of other engagement indicators, such as ‘number_intervention_answersheets’—the number of completed lessons, ‘logins_first_4_weeks’—login frequency, and ‘number_diary_answersheets’—the number of completed diaries. The results from this phase highlighted the multifaceted nature of engagement, showing that while ‘total_minutes’ is strongly correlated with engagement, indicating that more engaged participants tend to spend more time on the intervention, the comprehensive engagement profile also depends on additional aspects like lesson completions and frequency of platform interactions."

Here we introduce ehrapy, a modular open-source Python framework designed for exploratory analysis of heterogeneous epidemiology and EHR data. ehrapy incorporates a series of analytical steps, from data extraction and quality control to the generation of low-dimensional representations. Complemented by rich statistical modules, ehrapy facilitates associating patients with disease states, differential comparison between patient clusters, survival analysis, trajectory inference, causal inference and more. Leveraging ontologies, ehrapy further enables data sharing and training EHR deep learning models, paving the way for foundational models in biomedical research. We demonstrate ehrapy’s features in six distinct examples. We applied ehrapy to stratify patients affected by unspecified pneumonia into finer-grained phenotypes. Furthermore, we reveal biomarkers for significant differences in survival among these groups. Additionally, we quantify medication-class effects of pneumonia medications on length of stay. We further leveraged ehrapy to analyze cardiovascular risks across different data modalities. We reconstructed disease state trajectories in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) based on imaging data. Finally, we conducted a case study to demonstrate how ehrapy can detect and mitigate biases in EHR data. ehrapy, thus, provides a framework that we envision will standardize analysis pipelines on EHR data and serve as a cornerstone for the community."

        "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) tomography is a powerful investigative tool for many scientific domains, going from materials science, to engineering, to medicine. Many factors may limit the 3D resolution, often spatially anisotropic, compromising the precision of the information retrievable. A neural network, designed for video-frame interpolation, is employed to enhance tomographic images, achieving cubic-voxel resolution. The method is applied to distinct domains: the investigation of the morphology of printed graphene nanosheets networks, obtained via focused ion beam-scanning electron microscope (FIB-SEM), magnetic resonance imaging of the human brain, and X-ray computed tomography scans of the abdomen. The accuracy of the 3D tomographic maps can be quantified through computer-vision metrics, but most importantly with the precision on the physical quantities retrievable from the reconstructions, in the case of FIB-SEM the porosity, tortuosity, and effective diffusivity. This work showcases a versatile image-augmentation strategy for optimizing 3D tomography acquisition conditions, while preserving the information content."

        "abstract": "Whether differences in lifestyle between co-twins are reflected in differences in their internal or external exposome profiles remains largely underexplored. We therefore investigated whether within-pair differences in lifestyle were associated with within-pair differences in exposome profiles across four domains: the external exposome, proteome, metabolome and epigenetic age acceleration (EAA). For each domain, we assessed the similarity of co-twin profiles using Gaussian similarities in up to 257 young adult same-sex twin pairs (54% monozygotic). We additionally tested whether similarity in one domain translated into greater similarity in another. Results suggest that a lower degree of similarity in co-twins' exposome profiles was associated with greater differences in their behavior and substance use. The strongest association was identified between excessive drinking behavior and the external exposome. Overall, our study demonstrates how social behavior and especially substance use are connected to the internal and external exposomes, while controlling for familial confounders."

        "abstract": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most prevalent form of dementia, requires early prediction for timely intervention. Current deep learning approaches, particularly those using traditional neural networks, face challenges such as handling high-dimensional data, interpreting complex relationships, and managing data bias. To address these limitations, we propose a framework utilizing graph neural networks (GNNs), which excel in modeling relationships within graph-structured data. Our study employs GNNs on data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative for binary and multi-class classification across the three stages of AD: cognitively normal (CN), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). By incorporating comorbidity data derived from electronic health records, we achieved the most effective multi-classification results. Notably, the GNN model (Chebyshev Convolutional Neural Networks) demonstrated superior performance with a 0.98 accuracy in multi-class classification and 0.99, 0.93, and 0.94 in the AD/CN, AD/MCI, and CN/MCI binary tasks, respectively. The model’s robustness was further validated using the Australian Imaging, Biomarker & Lifestyle dataset as an external validation set. This work contributes to the field by offering a robust, accurate, and cost-effective method for early AD prediction (CN vs. MCI), addressing key challenges in existing deep learning approaches."

Using a rat model induced with L-NAME, we carefully investigated placental dysfunction via microstructural analysis and immunoprotein level assessment. Employing the Boruta feature selection method on ultrasound images facilitated the identification of crucial features, consequently enabling the development of a robust model for classifying placental dysfunction. Our study included 12 pregnant rats, and thorough placental evaluations were conducted on 160 fetal rats. Distinct alterations in placental microstructure and angiogenic factor expression were evident in rats with preeclampsia. Leveraging high-throughput mining of quantitative image features, we extracted 558 radiomic features, which were subsequently used to construct an impressive evaluation model with an area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.95. This model also exhibited a remarkable sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 88.7%, 91.5%, 90.2%, 90.4%, and 90.0%, respectively. Our findings highlight the ability of ultrasound-based radiomics to detect abnormal placental features, demonstrating its potential for evaluating both normative and impaired placental function with high precision and reliability."

This study aimed to investigate the function and underlying mechanisms of FABP4 in the progression of ASH. We first obtained alcoholic hepatitis (AH) datasets from the National Center for Biotechnology Information–Gene Expression Omnibus database and conducted bioinformatics analysis to identify critical genes in the FABP family. We then established ASH models of the wild-type (WT) and Fabp4-deficient (Fabp4−/−) mice to investigate the role of FABP4 in ASH. Additionally, we performed transcriptional profiling of mouse liver tissue and analyzed the results using integrative bioinformatics. The FABP4-associated signaling pathway was further verified. FABP4 was upregulated in two AH datasets and was thus identified as a critical biomarker for AH. FABP4 expression was higher in the liver tissues of patients with alcoholic liver disease and ASH mice than in the corresponding control samples. Furthermore, the Fabp4−/− ASH mice showed reduced hepatic lipid deposition and inflammation compared with the WT ASH mice. Mechanistically, Fabp4 may be involved in regulating the p53 and sirtuin-1 signaling pathways, subsequently affecting lipid metabolism and macrophage polarization in the liver of ASH mice. Our results demonstrate that Fabp4 is involved in the progression of ASH and that Fabp4 deficiency may ameliorate ASH. Therefore, FABP4 may be a potential therapeutic target for ASH treatment."

This study investigated resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) activity in patients with MDD and those whose diagnosis changed from MDD to BD. Among sixty-eight enrolled patients with MDD, the diagnosis of 17 patients converted to BD during the study period. We applied machine learning techniques to differentiate the two groups using sensor- and source-level EEG features. At the sensor level, patients with BD showed higher theta band power at the AF3 channel and low-alpha band power at the FC5 channel compared to patients with MDD. At the source level, patients with BD showed higher theta band activity in the right anterior cingulate and low-alpha band activity in the left parahippocampal gyrus. These four EEG features were selected for discriminating between BD and MDD with the best classification performance showing an accuracy of 80.88%, a sensitivity of 76.47%, and a specificity of 82.35%. Our findings revealed distinct theta and low-alpha band activities in patients with BD and MDD. These differences could potentially serve as candidate neuromarkers for the diagnosis and diagnostic transition between the two distinct mood disorders."

Most recent studies focus on the application of proprietary LLMs. Using proprietary LLMs introduces multiple risk factors, including a lack of transparency and vendor dependency. While open-source LLMs allow better transparency and customization, their performance falls short compared to the proprietary ones. In this study, we investigated to what extent fine-tuning open-source LLMs can further improve their performance. Utilizing a benchmark dataset, MedReview, consisting of 8161 pairs of systematic reviews and summaries, we fine-tuned three broadly-used, open-sourced LLMs, namely PRIMERA, LongT5, and Llama-2. Overall, the performance of open-source models was all improved after fine-tuning. The performance of fine-tuned LongT5 is close to GPT-3.5 with zero-shot settings. Furthermore, smaller fine-tuned models sometimes even demonstrated superior performance compared to larger zero-shot models. The above trends of improvement were manifested in both a human evaluation and a larger-scale GPT4-simulated evaluation."

We used remote sensing and census data to investigate potential connections between environmental factors and mental health disorders. Land cover variables were assessed using the European Space Agency (ESA) global WorldCover product at 10 m resolution together with the database of mental health diagnosed cases (n = 5769) from the Brazilian Unified Health System’s Department of Informatics (DATASUS) from every health facility of the city of Porto Alegre. The association of mental health data with land cover was established with machine learning algorithms and polynomial regression models. The results suggest that higher trees cover at neighborhood level was associated with better mental health index. A lower mental health index was also found to be associated with an higher Human Development Index. Our results highlight the potential of greenness in the city environment to achieve substantially better mental health outcomes."

This paper endeavors to gauge how precisely the connectome structure of the brain can predict an individual’s social environment, thereby inversely assessing how social influences are engraved in the neural development of the Adolescent brain. Utilizing Adolescent Brain and Cognition Development (ABCD) data (9099 children residing in the United States), we found that social conditions both at the household and neighborhood levels are significantly associated with specific neural connections. Solely with brain connectome data, we train a linear support vector machine (SVM) to predict socio-economic conditions of those adolescents. The classification performance generally improves when the thresholds of the advantageous and disadvantageous environments compartmentalize the extreme cases. Among the tested thresholds, the 20th and 80th percentile thresholds using the dual combination of household income and neighborhood education yielded the highest Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) of 0.8224. We identified 8 significant connections that critically contribute to predicting social environments in the parietal lobe and frontal lobe. Insights into social factors that contribute to early brain connectome development is critical to mitigate the disadvantages of children growing up in unfavorable neighborhoods."

        "abstract": "In intensive care unit (ICU) patients undergoing mechanical ventilation (MV), the occurrence of difficult weaning contributes to increased ventilator-related complications, prolonged hospitalization duration, and a significant rise in healthcare costs. Therefore, early identification of influencing factors and prediction of patients at risk of difficult weaning can facilitate early intervention and preventive measures. This study aimed to strengthen airway management for ICU patients by constructing a risk prediction model with comprehensive and individualized offline programs based on machine learning techniques. This study involved the collection of data from 487 patients undergoing MV in the ICU, with a total of 36 variables recorded. The dataset was divided into a training set (70% of the data) and a test set (30% of the data). Five machine learning models, namely logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine, light gradient boosting machine, and extreme gradient boosting, were compared to predict the risk of difficult weaning in ICU patients with MV. Significant influencing factors were identified based on the results of these models, and a risk prediction model for ICU patients with MV was established. When evaluating the models using AUC (Area under the Curve of ROC) and Accuracy as performance metrics, the Random Forest algorithm exhibited the best performance among the five machine learning algorithms. The area under the operating characteristic curve for the subjects was 0.805, with an accuracy of 0.748, recall (0.888), specificity (0.767) and F1 score (0.825). This study successfully developed a risk prediction model for ICU patients with MV using a machine learning algorithm. The Random Forest algorithm demonstrated the highest prediction performance. These findings can assist clinicians in accurately assessing the risk of difficult weaning in patients and formulating effective individualized treatment plans. Ultimately, this can help reduce the risk of difficult weaning and improve the quality of life for patients."

In this study, a rat calvarial defect model was used as a reference to investigate the influence of composition and architecture of 3D-printed cement, with or without bioactives, on tissue regeneration. Printable cement pastes were formulated by combining hyaluronic acid and cement precursors. Cementitious scaffolds were printed with 3 different patterns. After 7 weeks of implantation with or without bone marrow, multiparametric qualitative and quantitative assessments were performed using µCT, SEM, and histology. None of the set-up strategies was as efficient as autologous cancellous bone graft to repair calvarial defects. Nonetheless, the presence of scaffold improved the skull vault closure, particularly when the scaffold was soaked in total bone marrow before implantation. No significant effect of scaffold macro-architecture was observed on tissue mineralization. Magnesium phosphate-based scaffolds (MgP) seemed to induce higher bone formation than their calcium-phosphate-based counterparts. They also displayed a quicker biodegradation and sparse remaining material was found after 7 weeks of implantation. Although further improvements are required to reach clinical settings, this study demonstrated the potential of organo-mineral cements for bone regeneration and highlighted the peculiar properties of MgP-based cements."

To address this challenge, we developed “DecXpert” a novel Computer-Aided Detection (CAD) software solution based on deep neural networks for early TB diagnosis from CXRs, aiming to detect subtle abnormalities that may be overlooked by human interpretation alone. This study was conducted on the largest cohort size to date, where the performance of a CAD software (DecXpert version 1.4) was validated against the gold standard molecular diagnostic technique, GeneXpert MTB/RIF, analyzing data from 4363 individuals across 12 primary health care centers and one tertiary hospital in North India. DecXpert demonstrated 88% sensitivity (95% CI 0.85–0.93) and 85% specificity (95% CI 0.82–0.91) for active TB detection. Incorporating demographics, DecXpert achieved an area under the curve of 0.91 (95% CI 0.88–0.94), indicating robust diagnostic performance. Our findings establish DecXpert's potential as an accurate, efficient AI solution for early identification of active TB cases. Deployed as a screening tool in resource-limited settings, DecXpert could enable early identification of individuals with TB disease and facilitate effective TB management where skilled radiological interpretation is limited."

In this study, we analyze interictal electroencephalography (EEG) data to predict drug refractoriness in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) who were treated with monotherapy at the time of the first EEG acquisition. Various EEG features were extracted, including statistical measurements and interchannel coherence. Feature selection was performed to identify the optimal features, and classification was conducted using different classifiers. Functional connectivity and graph theory measurements were calculated to identify characteristics of refractory TLE. Among the 48 participants, 34 (70.8%) were responsive, while 14 (29.2%) were refractory over a mean follow-up duration of 38.5 months. Coherence feature within the gamma frequency band exhibited the most favorable performance. The light gradient boosting model, employing the mutual information filter-based feature selection method, demonstrated the highest performance (AUROC = 0.821). Compared to the responsive group, interchannel coherence displayed higher values in the refractory group. Interestingly, graph theory measurements using EEG coherence exhibited higher values in the refractory group than in the responsive group.

By incorporating squeeze-and-excitation networks, a channel attention mechanism, and concatenated attention neural network, a spatial attention mechanism, the model can more adeptly focus on the critical regions and finer details of brain tumors. Residual network-50 combined attention module and feature pyramid network as the backbone network to effectively capture multi-scale characteristics of brain tumors. At the same time, the region proposal network and region of interest align technology were used to ensure that the segmentation area matched the actual tumor morphology. The originality of the research lies in the deep residual network that combines attention mechanism with feature pyramid network to replace the backbone based on mask region convolutional neural network, achieving an improvement in the efficiency of brain tumor feature extraction. After a series of experiments, the precision of the model is 90.72%, which is 0.76% higher than that of the original model. Recall was 91.68%, an increase of 0.95%; Mean Intersection over Union was 94.56%, an increase of 1.39%. This method achieves precise segmentation of brain tumor magnetic resonance imaging, and doctors can easily and accurately locate the tumor area through the segmentation results, thereby quickly measuring the diameter, area, and other information of the tumor, providing doctors with more comprehensive diagnostic information."

Our platform allows clinical and genetic data to be harmonized by combining them under a unified framework. It supports combined genotype–phenotype queries and analysis, gives institutions control of their data and provides immutable user access logs, improving transparency into how and when health information is used. We demonstrate the value of our framework for precision medicine by creating genotype–phenotype cohorts and examining relationships within them. We show that combining data across institutions using our secure platform increases statistical power for rare disease analysis. By offering an integrated, secure and decentralized framework, we aim to enhance reproducibility and encourage broader participation from communities and patients in data sharing."

To diagnose the lesion area, otologists typically assess ossicular mobility through intraoperative palpation. Quantification of ossicular mobility and evidence-based diagnostic criteria are necessary for accurate assessment of each pathology, because diagnosis via palpation can rely on the surgeons’ experiences and skills. In this study, ossicular mobilities were simulated in 92 pathological cases of ossicular fixation as compliances using a finite-element (FE) model of the human middle ear. The validity of the ossicular mobilities obtained from the FE model was verified by comparison with measurements of ossicular mobilities in cadavers using our newly developed intraoperative ossicular mobility measurement system. The fixation-induced changes in hearing were validated by comparison with changes in the stapedial velocities obtained from the FE model with measurements reported in patients and in temporal bones. The 92 cases were classified into four groups by conducting a cluster analysis based on the simulated ossicular compliances. Most importantly, the cases of combined fixation of the malleus and/or the incus with otosclerosis were classified into two different surgical procedure groups by degree of fixation, i.e., malleo-stapedotomy and stapedotomy. These results suggest that pathological characteristics can be detected using quantitatively measured ossicular compliances followed by cluster analysis, and therefore, an effective diagnosis of ossicular fixation is achievable."

A pathologic response (primary objective) was observed in 5/10 patients, with 2 patients showing a major pathologic response. No patient achieved a complete pathologic response. A partial radiologic response (secondary objective) was observed in 3/10 patients, 5/10 patients had stable disease and 2/10 patients were non-evaluable on magnetic resonance imaging. All patients completed treatment without severe toxicity (exploratory objective). At median duration of follow-up of 22.5 months, two non-responders experienced disease recurrence. In-depth analysis of the loco-regional and systemic immune response (predefined exploratory objective) showed that monoclonal T cell expansion significantly correlated with treatment response. Tumour-draining lymph nodes displayed clonal overlap with intra-tumoural T cell expansion. All pre-specified endpoints, efficacy in terms of pathologic response as primary endpoint, radiologic response as secondary outcome and safety and tolerability as exploratory endpoint, were reached. Neoadjuvant ICB with pembrolizumab proved safe and induced pathologic, radiologic, and immunologic responses in MMRd EC, warranting further exploration of extended neoadjuvant treatment."

Recently uncovered, histone lysine lactylation (kla) has assumed a crucial role in cancer progression. However, the correlation with lncRNAs remains ambiguous. Scrutinizing lncRNAs associated with Kla not only improves clinical breast cancer management but also establishes a groundwork for antitumor drug development. We procured breast tissue samples, encompassing both normal and cancerous specimens, from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Utilizing Cox regression and XGBoost methods, we developed a prognostic model using identified kla-related lncRNAs. The model's predictive efficacy underwent validation across training, testing, and the overall cohort. Functional analysis concerning kla-related lncRNAs ensued. We identified and screened 8 kla-related lncRNAs to formulate the risk model. Pathway analysis disclosed the connection between immune-related pathways and the risk model of kla-related lncRNAs. Significantly, the risk scores exhibited a correlation with both immune cell infiltration and immune function, indicating a clear association. Noteworthy is the observation that patients with elevated risk scores demonstrated an increased tumor mutation burden (TMB) and decreased tumor immune dysfunction and exclusion (TIDE) scores, suggesting heightened responses to immune checkpoint blockade. Our study uncovers a potential link between Kla-related lncRNAs and BC, providing innovative therapeutic guidelines for BC management."

        "abstract": "Glaucoma is a group of neurodegenerative diseases that can lead to irreversible blindness. Yet, the progression can be slowed down if diagnosed and treated early enough. Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) can non-invasively provide valuable information about the retinal microcirculation that has shown to be correlated with the onset of the disease. The vessel density (VD) is the most commonly used biomarker to quantify this vascular information. However, different studies showed that there is a great impact of the acquisition area on the performance of the VD to distinguish between glaucoma patients and a healthy control group. It also seems that the separate capillary plexuses are differently affected by the disease and therefore also influence the results. So in this study we investigate the impact of the acquisition area (3 \\(\\times \\) 3 \\(\\textrm{mm}\\) macular scan, 6.44 \\(\\times \\) 6.4 \\(\\textrm{mm}\\) macular scan, 6 \\(\\times \\) 6 \\(\\textrm{mm}\\) optic nerve head (ONH) scan) and the different plexuses on the machine-learning-based distinction between glaucoma patients and healthy controls. The results yielded that the 6 \\(\\times \\) 6 \\(\\textrm{mm}\\) ONH show the best performance over all plexuses. Moreover the deep learning-based approach outperforms the VD as a biomarker on every acquisition area and plexus. In addition to that, it also performs better than traditional biomarkers obtained from the OCT scans that are used in the clinical routine for diagnosis and progression tracking of glaucoma. Consequently, OCTA scans of the ONH might be a useful addition to OCT when studying glaucoma."

        "abstract": "While multiple factors impact disease, artificial intelligence (AI) studies in medicine often use small, non-diverse patient cohorts due to data sharing and privacy issues. Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a solution, enabling training across hospitals without direct data sharing. Here, we present FL-PedBrain, an FL platform for pediatric posterior fossa brain tumors, and evaluate its performance on a diverse, realistic, multi-center cohort. Pediatric brain tumors were targeted due to the scarcity of such datasets, even in tertiary care hospitals. Our platform orchestrates federated training for joint tumor classification and segmentation across 19 international sites. FL-PedBrain exhibits less than a 1.5% decrease in classification and a 3% reduction in segmentation performance compared to centralized data training. FL boosts segmentation performance by 20 to 30% on three external, out-of-network sites. Finally, we explore the sources of data heterogeneity and examine FL robustness in real-world scenarios with data imbalances."

        "abstract": "Assessing pain in newborns in the NICU is crucial due to their frequent exposure to painful stimuli, yet it's challenging due to the subjective nature of current methods. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of an AI system designed for automatic facial recognition by comparing its performance with the expert opinion of health care provider. This is a secondary analysis from an eye-tracking study, assessing neonatal pain evaluations by healthcare professionals. The performance of AI software, FaceReader 9, was compared to experts' evaluations using a visual-analog scale, focusing on identifying specific facial action units associated with different pain levels. The study found significant differences in AI-generated metrics—arousal and valence—across three stimulus types: non-noxious thermal, short-noxious, and prolonged-noxious, with p-values below 0.001. A strong correlation (r = 0.84, p ≤ .001) was observed between AI metrics and expert ratings. Eleven facial action units were identified as relevant to describe neonatal pain. The findings highlight the AI system's potential in accurately detecting and analyzing newborn facial expressions in response to varying pain intensities, demonstrating a significant correlation with healthcare professionals' assessments. This suggests that AI technology could enhance objective pain assessment in neonates."

        "abstract": "Cognitive deficits are prevalent in individuals with psychosis and are associated with neurobiological changes, potentially serving as an endophenotype for psychosis. Using the HCP-Early-Psychosis-dataset (n = 226), we aimed to investigate cognitive subtypes (deficit/intermediate/spared) through data-driven clustering in affective (AP) and non-affective psychosis patients (NAP) and controls (HC). We explored differences between three clusters in symptoms, cognition, medication, and grey matter volume. Applying principal component analysis, we selected features for clustering. Features that explained most variance were scores for intelligence, verbal recognition and comprehension, auditory attention, working memory, reasoning and executive functioning. Fuzzy K-Means clustering on those features revealed that the subgroups significantly varied in cognitive impairment, clinical symptoms, and, importantly, also in medication and grey matter volume in fronto-parietal and subcortical networks. The spared cluster (86%HC, 37%AP, 17%NAP) exhibited unimpaired cognition, lowest symptoms/medication, and grey matter comparable to controls. The deficit cluster (4%HC, 10%AP, 47%NAP) had impairments across all domains, highest symptoms scores/medication dosage, and pronounced grey matter alterations. The intermediate deficit cluster (11%HC, 54%AP, 36%NAP) showed fewer deficits than the second cluster, but similar symptoms/medication/grey matter to the spared cluster. Controlling for medication, cognitive scores correlated with grey matter changes and negative symptoms across all patients. Our findings generally emphasize the interplay between cognition, brain structure, symptoms, and medication in AP and NAP, and specifically suggest a possible mediating role of cognition, highlighting the potential of screening cognitive changes to aid tailoring treatments and interventions."

However, diverse bioactivity data types, including single-dose and multi-dose-response assay results, present challenges. Traditional models utilize only multi-dose data, overlooking information contained in single-dose measurements. Here, we propose a machine learning methodology for compound-kinase activity prediction that leverages both single-dose and dose-response data. We demonstrate that our two-stage approach yields accurate activity predictions and significantly improves model performance compared to training solely on dose-response labels. This superior performance is consistent across five diverse machine learning methods. Using the best performing model, we carried out extensive experimental profiling on a total of 347 selected compound-kinase pairs, achieving a high hit rate of 40% and a negative predictive value of 78%. We show that these rates can be improved further by incorporating model uncertainty estimates into the compound selection process. By integrating multiple activity data types, we demonstrate that our approach holds promise for facilitating the development of training activity datasets in a more efficient and cost-effective way."

However, AI readers cannot perform at the level of multi-reader systems used by screening programs in countries such as Australia, Sweden, and the UK. Therefore, implementation demands human-AI collaboration. Here, we use a large, high-quality retrospective mammography dataset from Victoria, Australia to conduct detailed simulations of five potential AI-integrated screening pathways, and examine human-AI interaction effects to explore automation bias. Operating an AI reader as a second reader or as a high confidence filter improves current screening outcomes by 1.9–2.5% in sensitivity and up to 0.6% in specificity, achieving 4.6–10.9% reduction in assessments and 48–80.7% reduction in human reads. Automation bias degrades performance in multi-reader settings but improves it for single-readers. This study provides insight into feasible approaches for AI-integrated screening pathways and prospective studies necessary prior to clinical adoption."

We aimed to identify patterns of dynamic platelet count trajectories and evaluate their association with outcomes and thrombocytopenia in septic patients. We tested the longitudinal platelet trajectory patterns of sepsis patients within the first four days of ICU admission in the MIMIC-IV database and their association with 28-day mortality, and independently validated our findings in the eICU-CRD database. Statistical methods used included multivariate regression, propensity score analysis, doubly robust estimation, gradient boosting model, and inverse probability weighting to ensure the robustness of our findings. A total of 22,866 septic patients were included in our study. The trajectory analysis categorizes patients into ascending (AS), stable (ST), or descending (DS) patterns. The risk of 28-day mortality was increased in the DS patients (OR = 2.464, 95%CI 1.895–3.203, p < 0.001) and ST patients (OR = 1.302, 95%CI 1.067–1.589, p = 0.009) compared to AS patients. The AS patients had lower ICU length of stay (2.36 vs. 4.32, p < 0.001) and 28-day maximum SOFA scores (5.00 vs. 6.00, p < 0.001) than the DS patients, but had more ventilator-free days within 28 days than the DS group (26.00 vs. 24.00, p < 0.001). The mediating effect of thrombocytopenia was significant (p < 0.001 for the average causal mediation effect (ACME)). Longitudinal platelet trajectory was associated with risk-adjusted 28-day mortality among patients with sepsis and was proportionally mediated through thrombocytopenia."

We collected a total of 166 cervical exfoliated cells and divided them into five groups based on histopathological results. Each sample was divided into two portions, one for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) detection and the other for bisulfite sequencing polymerase chain reaction (BSP) detection. We found that FISH detection of CAPZB mRNA mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) and BSP detection of CAPZB deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) percentage of methylation rate (PMR) performed as biomarkers for distinguishing HSIL from LSIL, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity and cut-off value of 0.893, 81.25%, 80.39% and 0.616, 0.794, 64.06%, 81.37% and 0.454, respectively. Furthermore, FISH detection of CAPZB mRNA exhibited a greater AUC (0.893) for the detection of HSIL than the CAPZB DNA methylation method (0.794), indicating the CAPZB mRNA levels can be used as a biomarker for assessing cervical lesions."

The use of FFA based on deep learning technology has feasibility in predicting the treatment effect of BRVO-ME. The FFA-Net model constructed with the VGG model as the main body has good results in predicting the treatment effect of BRVO-ME.

We pretrain a U-Net model on a large dataset of unannotated coronary angiograms using an image-to-image translation framework, then fine-tune it on a limited set of manually annotated samples. The pretrained model excels at comprehensive single-frame subtraction, outperforming existing DSA methods. Fine-tuning with just 40 samples yields a Dice coefficient of 0.828 for vessel segmentation. On the public XCAD dataset, our model sets a new state-of-the-art benchmark with a Dice coefficient of 0.755, surpassing both unsupervised and supervised learning approaches. This method achieves robust single-frame subtraction and demonstrates that combining pretraining with minimal fine-tuning enables accurate coronary vessel segmentation with limited manual annotations. We successfully apply this approach to assist physicians in visualizing potential vascular stenosis sites during coronary angiography.

Non-linear entanglement of image features makes deep learning a “black box” lacking human meaningful explanations for the models’ decision. We present DISCOVER, a generative model designed to discover the underlying visual properties driving image-based classification models. DISCOVER learns disentangled latent representations, where each latent feature encodes a unique classification-driving visual property. This design enables “human-in-the-loop” interpretation by generating disentangled exaggerated counterfactual explanations. We apply DISCOVER to interpret classification of in vitro fertilization embryo morphology quality. We quantitatively and systematically confirm the interpretation of known embryo properties, discover properties without previous explicit measurements, and quantitatively determine and empirically verify the classification decision of specific embryo instances. We show that DISCOVER provides human-interpretable understanding of “black box” classification models, proposes hypotheses to decipher underlying biomedical mechanisms, and provides transparency for the classification of individual predictions."

CURATE.AI, a clinical decision support system, offers an alternative to big data approaches by calibrating individual treatment profiles based on that individual’s data alone. We present a case study from the PRECISE CURATE.AI trial with a WM patient, where, over two years, CURATE.AI provided dynamic Ibrutinib dose recommendations to clinicians (users) aimed at achieving optimal IgM levels. An 80-year-old male with newly diagnosed WM requiring treatment due to anemia was recruited to the trial for CURATE.AI-based dosing of the Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor Ibrutinib. The primary and secondary outcome measures were focused on scientific and logistical feasibility. Preliminary results underscore the platform’s potential in enhancing user and patient engagement, in addition to clinical efficacy. Based on a two-year-long patient enrollment into the CURATE.AI-augmented treatment, this study showcases how AI-enabled tools can support the management of rare diseases, emphasizing the integration of AI to enhance personalized therapy."

        "abstract": "Flow-based microfluidic biochips (FMBs) are widely used in biomedical research and diagnostics. However, their security against potential material-level cyber-physical attacks remains inadequately explored, posing a significant future challenge. One of the main components, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microvalves, is pivotal to FMBs' functionality. However, their fabrication, which involves thermal curing, makes them susceptible to chemical tampering-induced material degradation attacks. Here, we demonstrate one such material-based attack termed “BioTrojans,” which are chemically tampered and optically stealthy microvalves that can be ruptured through low-frequency actuations. To chemically tamper with the microvalves, we altered the associated PDMS curing ratio. Attack demonstrations showed that BioTrojan valves with 30:1 and 50:1 curing ratios ruptured quickly under 2 Hz frequency actuations, while authentic microvalves with a 10:1 ratio remained intact even after being actuated at the same frequency for 2 days (345,600 cycles). Dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA) results and associated finite element analysis revealed that a BioTrojan valve stores three orders of magnitude more mechanical energy than the authentic one, making it highly susceptible to low-frequency-induced ruptures. To counter BioTrojan attacks, we propose a security-by-design approach using smooth peripheral fillets to reduce stress concentration by over 50% and a spectral authentication method using fluorescent microvalves capable of effectively detecting BioTrojans."

This study aimed to develop and evaluate OSA prediction models using simple and accessible parameters, combined with multiple machine learning algorithms, and integrate them into a cloud-based mobile sleep medicine management platform for clinical use. The study data were obtained from the clinical records of 610 patients who underwent polysomnography (PSG) at the Sleep Medicine Center of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University between January 2021 and December 2022. The participants were randomly divided into a training-test group (80%) and an independent validation group (20%). The logistic regression, artificial neural network, naïve Bayes, support vector machine, random forest, and decision tree algorithms were used with age, gender, BMI, and mean heart rate during sleep as predictors to build a risk prediction model for moderate-to-severe OSA. To evaluate the performance of the models, we calculated the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC), accuracy, recall, specificity, precision, and F1-score for the independent validation set. In addition, the calibration curve, decision curve, and clinical impact curve were generated to determine clinical usefulness. Age, gender, BMI, and mean heart rate during sleep were significantly associated with OSA. The artificial neural network model had the best efficacy compared with the other prediction algorithms. The AUROC, accuracy, recall, specificity, precision, F1-score, and Brier score were 80.4% (95% CI 76.7–84.1%), 69.9% (95% CI 69.8–69.9%), 86.5% (95% CI 81.6–91.3%), 61.5% (95% CI 56.6–66.4%), 53.2% (95% CI 47.7–58.7%), 65.9% (95% CI 60.2–71.5%), and 0.165, respectively, for the artificial neural network model.

The six models based on four simple and easily accessible parameters effectively predicted moderate-to-severe OSA in patients with PSG screening, with the artificial neural network model having the best performance. These models can provide a reliable tool for early OSA diagnosis, and their integration into a cloud-based mobile sleep medicine management platform could improve clinical decision making."

This modality deficit has not been fully considered in many studies. Furthermore, the application of artificial intelligence in predicting the treatment response, particularly in complex diseases such as GC, is still in its infancy. Therefore, this study aimed to use a comprehensive analytic approach to accurately predict treatment responses to anti-HER2 therapy or anti-HER2 combined immunotherapy in patients with HER2-positive GC. We collected multi-modal data, comprising radiology, pathology, and clinical information from a cohort of 429 patients: 310 treated with anti-HER2 therapy and 119 treated with a combination of anti-HER2 and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors immunotherapy. We introduced a deep learning model, called the Multi-Modal model (MuMo), that integrates these data to make precise treatment response predictions. MuMo achieved an area under the curve score of 0.821 for anti-HER2 therapy and 0.914 for combined immunotherapy. Moreover, patients classified as low-risk by MuMo exhibited significantly prolonged progression-free survival and overall survival (log-rank test, P < 0.05). These findings not only highlight the significance of multi-modal data analysis in enhancing treatment evaluation and personalized medicine for HER2-positive gastric cancer, but also the potential and clinical value of our model."

This study uses citizen science and image feature analysis to profile the cellular features associated with antibiotic resistance in Escherichia coli. Between February and April 2023, we conducted the Infection Inspection project, in which 5273 volunteers made 1,045,199 classifications of single-cell images from five E. coli strains, labelling them as antibiotic-sensitive or antibiotic-resistant based on their response to the antibiotic ciprofloxacin. User accuracy in image classification reached 66.8 ± 0.1%, lower than our deep learning model's performance at 75.3 ± 0.4%, but both users and the model were more accurate when classifying cells treated at a concentration greater than the strain’s own minimum inhibitory concentration. We used the users’ classifications to elucidate which visual features influence classification decisions, most importantly the degree of DNA compaction and heterogeneity. We paired our classification data with an image feature analysis which showed that most of the incorrect classifications happened when cellular features varied from the expected response. This understanding informs ongoing efforts to enhance the robustness of our diagnostic methodology. Infection Inspection is another demonstration of the potential for public participation in research, specifically increasing public awareness of antibiotic resistance."

        "abstract": "Premature termination codons (PTCs) cause ~10–20% of inherited diseases and are a major mechanism of tumor suppressor gene inactivation in cancer. A general strategy to alleviate the effects of PTCs would be to promote translational readthrough. Nonsense suppression by small molecules has proven effective in diverse disease models, but translation into the clinic is hampered by ineffective readthrough of many PTCs. Here we directly tackle the challenge of defining drug efficacy by quantifying the readthrough of ~5,800 human pathogenic stop codons by eight drugs. We find that different drugs promote the readthrough of complementary subsets of PTCs defined by local sequence context. This allows us to build interpretable models that accurately predict drug-induced readthrough genome-wide, and we validate these models by quantifying endogenous stop codon readthrough. Accurate readthrough quantification and prediction will empower clinical trial design and the development of personalized nonsense suppression therapies."

        "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is closely associated with the development and chronicity of temporomandibular disorder (TMD). Given the intricate pathophysiology of both OSA and TMD, comprehensive diagnostic approaches are crucial. This study aimed to develop an automatic prediction model utilizing multimodal data to diagnose OSA among TMD patients. We collected a range of multimodal data, including clinical characteristics, portable polysomnography, X-ray, and MRI data, from 55 TMD patients who reported sleep problems. This data was then analyzed using advanced machine learning techniques. Three-dimensional VGG16 and logistic regression models were used to identify significant predictors. Approximately 53% (29 out of 55) of TMD patients had OSA. Performance accuracy was evaluated using logistic regression, multilayer perceptron, and area under the curve (AUC) scores. OSA prediction accuracy in TMD patients was 80.00–91.43%. When MRI data were added to the algorithm, the AUC score increased to 1.00, indicating excellent capability. Only the obstructive apnea index was statistically significant in predicting OSA in TMD patients, with a threshold of 4.25 events/h. The learned features of the convolutional neural network were visualized as a heatmap using a gradient-weighted class activation mapping algorithm, revealing that it focuses on differential anatomical parameters depending on the absence or presence of OSA. In OSA-positive cases, the nasopharynx, oropharynx, uvula, larynx, epiglottis, and brain region were recognized, whereas in OSA-negative cases, the tongue, nose, nasal turbinate, and hyoid bone were recognized. Prediction accuracy and heat map analyses support the plausibility and usefulness of this artificial intelligence-based OSA diagnosis and prediction model in TMD patients, providing a deeper understanding of regions distinguishing between OSA and non-OSA."

        "abstract": "Approximately 80% of pediatric tumors occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), where diagnostic tools essential for treatment decisions are often unavailable or incomplete. Development of cost-effective molecular diagnostics will help bridge the cancer diagnostic gap and ultimately improve pediatric cancer outcomes in LMIC settings. We investigated the feasibility of using nanopore whole transcriptome sequencing on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE)-derived RNA and a composite machine learning model for pediatric solid tumor diagnosis. Transcriptome cDNA sequencing was performed on a heterogenous set of 221 FFPE and 32 fresh frozen pediatric solid tumor and lymphoma specimens on Oxford Nanopore Technologies’ sequencing platforms. A composite machine learning model was then used to classify transcriptional profiles into clinically actionable tumor types and subtypes. In total, 95.6% and 89.7% of pediatric solid tumors and lymphoma specimens were correctly classified, respectively. 71.5% of pediatric solid tumors had prediction probabilities > 0.8 and were classified with 100% accuracy. Similarly, for lymphomas, 72.4% of samples that had prediction probabilities > 0.6 were classified with 97.6% accuracy. Additionally, FOXO1 fusion status was predicted accurately for 97.4% of rhabdomyosarcomas and MYCN amplification was predicted with 88% accuracy in neuroblastoma. Whole transcriptome sequencing from FFPE-derived pediatric solid tumor and lymphoma samples has the potential to provide clinical classification of both tissue lineage and core genomic classification. Further expansion, refinement, and validation of this approach is necessary to explore whether this technology could be part of the solution of addressing the diagnostic limitations in LMIC."

        "abstract": "Smile aesthetics is an important factor to consider during orthodontic treatment planning. The aim of the present study is to assess the predictability of Invisalign SmileView for digital AI smile simulation in comparison to actual smile treatment outcomes, using various smile assessment parameters. A total of 24 adult subjects (12 females and 12 males; mean age 22 ± 5.2 years) who chose to be treated using Invisalign were prospectively recruited to have their pretreatment smiles captured using the Invisalign SmileView to simulate their new smiles before treatment was started. Patients were then treated using upper and lower Invisalign aligners with average treatment time of 18 ± 6 months. Full post-treatment records were obtained and full smile frame images of simulated smile and actual final smile of each subject were evaluated by an independent examiner using an objective assessment sheet. Ten smile variants were used to assess the characteristics of the full smile images. Significance level was set at P < 0.05. The ICC for the quantitative parameters showed that there was an overall excellent & good internal consistency (alpha value > 0.7 & > 0.9). The Independent t test was performed amongst the quantitative variables. The P value was not significant for all except maxillary inter canine width (P = 0.05), stating that for the five variables namely; philtrum height, commissure height, smile width, buccal corridor and smile index, actual mean values were similar to the simulation mean values. For the qualitative variables, the Kappa value ranged between 0.66 and  − 0.75 which showed a substantial level of agreement between the examiners. Additionally, the Chi square test for the qualitative variables, revealed that the P value was found to be significant in all except lip line. This implies that only the lip line values are comparable. More optimal lip lines, straighter smile arcs and more ideal tooth display were achieved in actual post treatment results in comparison to the initially predicted smiles. Five quantitative smile assessment parameters i.e., philtrum height, commissure height, smile width, buccal corridor, and smile index, could be used as reliable predictors of smile simulation. Maxillary inter canine width cannot be considered to be a reliable parameter for smile simulation prediction. A single qualitative parameter, namely the lip line, can be used as a reliable predictor for smile simulation. Three qualitative parameters i.e., most posterior tooth display, smile arc, and amount of lower incisor exposure cannot be considered as reliable parameters for smile prediction."

        "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (A-fib) is the most common type of heart arrhythmia, typically treated with radiofrequency catheter ablation to isolate the heart from abnormal electrical signals. Monitoring the formation of ablation-induced lesions is crucial for preventing recurrences and complications arising from excessive or insufficient ablation. Existing imaging modalities lack real-time feedback, and their intraoperative usage is in its early stages. A critical need exists for an imaging-based lesion indexing (LSI) method that directly reflects tissue necrosis formation. Previous studies have indicated that spectroscopic photoacoustic (sPA) imaging can differentiate ablated tissues from their non-ablated counterparts based on PA spectrum variation. In this paper, we introduce a method for detecting ablation lesion boundaries using sPA imaging. This approach utilizes ablation LSI, which quantifies the ratio between the signal from ablated tissue and the total tissue signal. We enhance boundary detection accuracy by adapting a regression model-based compensation. Additionally, the method was cross-validated with clinically used intraoperative monitoring parameters. The proposed method was validated with ex vivo porcine cardiac tissues with necrotic lesions created by different ablation durations. The PA-measured lesion size was compared with gross pathology. Statistical analysis demonstrates a strong correlation (R > 0.90) between the PA-detected lesion size and gross pathology. The PA-detected lesion size also exhibits a moderate to strong correlation (R > 0.75) with local impedance changes recorded during procedures. These results suggest that the introduced PA imaging-based LSI has great potential to be incorporated into the clinical workflow, guiding ablation procedures intraoperatively."

We aimed to explore the role of cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs) and identify potential diagnostic biomarkers. Our analysis involved interrogating the GSE124272 and GSE150408 datasets for differential gene expression profiles associated with CRGs and immune characteristics. Molecular clustering was performed on LDH samples, followed by expression and immune infiltration analyses. Using the WGCNA algorithm, specific genes within CRG clusters were identified. After selecting the most predictive genes from the optimal model, four machine learning models were constructed and validated. This study identified nine CRGs associated with copper-regulated cell death. Two copper-containing molecular clusters linked to death were detected in LDH samples. Elevated expression and immune infiltration levels were found in LDH patients, particularly in CRG cluster C2. Utilizing XGB, five genes were identified for constructing a diagnostic model, achieving an area under the curve values of 0.715. In conclusion, this research provides valuable insights into the association between LDH and copper-regulated cell death, alongside proposing a promising predictive model."

As secondary analysis, user experience (usability and patient adherence) was evaluated. The evidences provided by the studies were categorized and stratified according to the level of maturity. Our results indicate that approximately 75% of articles investigated diagnostic sensitivity, i.e. correlation of sensor-data with clinical parameters. Evidence of clinical utility, defined as improvement on health outcomes or clinical decisions after the use of the wearables, was found only in nine papers. A third of the articles included reported evidence of user experience. Future research should focus more on clinical utility, to facilitate the translation of research results within the management of Parkinson’s Disease."

However, the impact of MMD-causing DYSF variants on brain structure and function remains unexplored. To investigate this, we utilized magnetic resonance (MR) modalities (MR volumetry and 31P MR spectroscopy) in a family with seven children, four of whom have the illness. The MMD siblings showed distinct differences from healthy controls: (1) a significant (p < 0.001) right-sided volume asymmetry (+ 232 mm3) of the inferior lateral ventricles; and (2) a significant (p < 0.001) decrease in [Mg2+], along with a modified energy metabolism profile and altered membrane turnover in the hippocampus and motor and premotor cortices. The patients' [Mg2+], energy metabolism, and membrane turnover measures returned to those of healthy relatives after a month of 400 mg/day magnesium supplementation. This work is the first to describe anatomical and functional abnormalities characteristic of neurodegeneration in the MMD brain. Therefore, we call for further examination of brain functions in larger cohorts of MMD patients and testing of magnesium supplementation, which has proven to be an effective corrective approach in our study."

        "abstract": "Radiomics features (RFs) serve as quantitative metrics to characterize shape, density/intensity, and texture patterns in radiological images. Despite their promise, RFs exhibit reproducibility challenges across acquisition settings, thus limiting implementation into clinical practice. In this investigation, we evaluate the effects of different CT scanners and CT acquisition protocols (KV, mA, field-of-view, and reconstruction kernel settings) on RFs extracted from lumbar vertebrae of a cadaveric trunk. Employing univariate and multivariate Generalized Linear Models (GLM), we evaluated the impact of each acquisition parameter on RFs. Our findings indicate that variations in mA had negligible effects on RFs, while alterations in kV resulted in exponential changes in several RFs, notably First Order (94.4%), GLCM (87.5%), and NGTDM (100%). Moreover, we demonstrated that a tailored GLM model was superior to the ComBat algorithm in harmonizing CT images. GLM achieved R2 > 0.90 in 21 RFs (19.6%), contrasting ComBat's mean R2 above 0.90 in only 1 RF (0.9%). This pioneering study unveils the effects of CT acquisition parameters on bone RFs in cadaveric specimens, highlighting significant variations across parameters and scanner datasets. The proposed GLM model presents a robust solution for mitigating these differences, potentially advancing harmonization efforts in Radiomics-based studies across diverse CT protocols and vendors."

The bioassay showed 97.92% and 96% accuracy in classifying samples in human and non-human primate (NHP) blood samples exposed ex vivo to 0–5 Gy X-rays, respectively up to 48 h after exposure, and an adequate correlation between reconstructed and actual dose in the human samples (R2 = 0.79, RMSE = 0.80 Gy, and MAE = 0.63 Gy) and NHP (R2 = 0.80, RMSE = 0.78 Gy, and MAE = 0.61 Gy). Biomarker measurements in vivo from four NHPs exposed to a single 2.5 Gy total body dose showed a persistent upregulation in blood samples collected on days 2 and 5 after irradiation. The data indicates that using a combined approach of targeted proteins can increase bioassay sensitivity and provide a more accurate dose prediction."

Nevertheless, the empirical evidence supporting this notion is largely based on correlational studies, warranting further investigation into the causal relationship. Here we identify the causal effect of video gaming on mental well-being in Japan (2020–2022) using game console lotteries as a natural experiment. Employing approaches designed for causal inference on survey data (n = 97,602), we found that game console ownership, along with increased game play, improved mental well-being. The console ownership reduced psychological distress and improved life satisfaction by 0.1–0.6 standard deviations. Furthermore, a causal forest machine learning algorithm revealed divergent impacts between different types of console, with one showing smaller benefits for adolescents and females while the other showed larger benefits for adolescents. These findings highlight the complex impact of digital media on mental well-being and the importance of considering differential screen time effects."

To overcome this obstacle, the research focuses on data synthesis using real-world time-series generative adversarial networks (RTSGAN). A total of 53,005 data were synthesized using the dataset of 15,799 patients with colorectal cancer. The results of the quantitative evaluation of the synthetic data’s quality are as follows: the Hellinger distance ranged from 0 to 0.25; the train on synthetic, test on real (TSTR) and train on real, test on synthetic (TRTS) results showed an average area under the curve of 0.99 and 0.98; a propensity mean squared error was 0.223. The synthetic and real data were similar in the qualitative methods including t-SNE and histogram analyses. The application of synthetic data in predicting five-year survival in colorectal cancer patients demonstrates comparable performance to models based on real data. This study employs distance to closest records and membership inference test to assess potential privacy exposure, revealing minimal risk. This study demonstrated that it is feasible to synthesize medical data, including time-series data, using the RTSGAN, and the synthetic data can be evaluated to accurately reflect the characteristics of real data through quantitative and qualitative methods as well as by utilizing real-world artificial intelligence models."

It has been shown that genetic alterations in pLGG can be identified non-invasively using MRI-based radiomic features or convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We aimed to build and assess a combined radiomics and CNN non-invasive pLGG molecular status identification model. This retrospective study used the tumor regions, manually segmented from T2-FLAIR MR images, of 336 patients treated for pLGG between 1999 and 2018. We designed a CNN and Random Forest radiomics model, along with a model relying on a combination of CNN and radiomic features, to predict the genetic status of pLGG. Additionally, we investigated whether CNNs could predict radiomic feature values from MR images. The combined model (mean AUC: 0.824) outperformed the radiomics model (0.802) and CNN (0.764). The differences in model performance were statistically significant (p-values < 0.05). The CNN was able to learn predictive radiomic features such as surface-to-volume ratio (average correlation: 0.864), and difference matrix dependence non-uniformity normalized (0.924) well but was unable to learn others such as run-length matrix variance (− 0.017) and non-uniformity normalized (− 0.042). Our results show that a model relying on both CNN and radiomic-based features performs better than either approach separately in differentiating the genetic status of pLGGs, and that CNNs are unable to express all handcrafted features."

Further, we aimed to provide the biological mechanisms underlying the model’s predictions. We collected multiscale data including baseline MRI images from 2776 glioma patients across two private (FAHZU and HPPH, n = 1931) and three public datasets (TCGA, n = 213; UCSF, n = 410; and EGD, n = 222). We trained and internally validated the MDL model using our private datasets, and externally validated it using the three public datasets. We used the model-predicted deep prognosis score (DPS) to stratify patients into low-DPS and high-DPS subtypes. Additionally, a radio-multiomics analysis was conducted to elucidate the biological basis of the DPS. In the external validation cohorts, the MDL model achieved average areas under the curve of 0.892–0.903, 0.710–0.894, and 0.850–0.879 for predicting IDH mutation status, 1p/19q co-deletion status, and tumor grade, respectively. Moreover, the MDL model yielded a C-index of 0.723 in the TCGA and 0.671 in the UCSF for the prediction of overall survival. The DPS exhibits significant correlations with activated oncogenic pathways, immune infiltration patterns, specific protein expression, DNA methylation, tumor mutation burden, and tumor-stroma ratio. Accordingly, our work presents an accurate and biologically meaningful tool for predicting molecular subtypes, tumor grade, and survival outcomes in gliomas, which provides personalized clinical decision-making in a global and non-invasive manner."

Identifying high-risk patients for prophylactic anticoagulation is challenging and adds to clinician burden. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) sequencing assays (‘liquid biopsies’) are widely implemented, but their utility for VTE prognostication is unknown. Here we analyzed three plasma sequencing cohorts: a pan-cancer discovery cohort of 4,141 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or breast, pancreatic and other cancers; a prospective validation cohort consisting of 1,426 patients with the same cancer types; and an international generalizability cohort of 463 patients with advanced NSCLC. ctDNA detection was associated with VTE independent of clinical and radiographic features. A machine learning model trained on liquid biopsy data outperformed previous risk scores (discovery, validation and generalizability c-indices 0.74, 0.73 and 0.67, respectively, versus 0.57, 0.61 and 0.54 for the Khorana score). In real-world data, anticoagulation was associated with lower VTE rates if ctDNA was detected (n = 2,522, adjusted hazard ratio (HR) = 0.50, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.30–0.81); ctDNA− patients (n = 1,619) did not benefit from anticoagulation (adjusted HR = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.40–2.0). These results provide preliminary evidence that liquid biopsies may improve VTE risk stratification in addition to clinical parameters. Interventional, randomized prospective studies are needed to confirm the clinical utility of liquid biopsies for guiding anticoagulation in patients with cancer."

Recordings from electrodes implanted for therapeutic deep brain stimulation, in contrast, provide clear deep brain signals but are not suited for studying cortical activity. Therefore, we combine magnetoencephalography and local field potential recordings from deep brain stimulation electrodes in individuals with Parkinson’s disease. Here, we make these data available, inviting a broader scientific community to explore the dynamics of neural activity in the subthalamic nucleus and its functional connectivity to cortex. The dataset encompasses resting-state recordings, plus two motor tasks: static forearm extension and self-paced repetitive fist clenching. Most patients were recorded both in the medicated and the unmedicated state.

The objective was to investigate whether serum total cholesterol plays a significant role in the progression of KOA. This cross-sectional study utilized data from the public database DRYAD. LASSO regression was employed to identify risk factors associated with the graded progression of KOA. Additionally, six ML algorithms were utilized in conjunction with clinical features and relevant variables to construct a prediction model. The significance and ranking of variables were carefully analyzed. The variables incorporated in the model include JBS3, Diabetes, Hypertension, HDL, TC, BMI, SES, and AGE. Serum total cholesterol emerged as a significant risk factor for the graded progression of KOA in all six ML algorithms used for importance ranking. XGBoost algorithm was based on the combined best performance of the training and validation sets. The ML algorithm enables predictive modeling of risk factors for the progression of the KOA K–L classification and confirms that serum total cholesterol is an important risk factor for the progression of KOA."

A deep learning time-to-event predictive model trained on a hybrid mechanistic + clinical data set from 93 patients achieved higher per-patient predictive accuracy based on event-time concordance, Brier score, and negative binomial log-likelihood-based criteria than when trained on only mechanistic model-derived values or only clinical data. Feature importance analysis revealed that both clinical and model-derived parameters play prominent roles in increasing prediction accuracy, further supporting the advantage of our hybrid approach."

        "abstract": "This study investigated the usefulness of deep learning-based automatic detection of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) effusion using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with temporomandibular disorder and whether the diagnostic accuracy of the model improved when patients’ clinical information was provided in addition to MRI images. The sagittal MR images of 2948 TMJs were collected from 1017 women and 457 men (mean age 37.19 ± 18.64 years). The TMJ effusion diagnostic performances of three convolutional neural networks (scratch, fine-tuning, and freeze schemes) were compared with those of human experts based on areas under the curve (AUCs) and diagnosis accuracies. The fine-tuning model with proton density (PD) images showed acceptable prediction performance (AUC = 0.7895), and the from-scratch (0.6193) and freeze (0.6149) models showed lower performances (p < 0.05). The fine-tuning model had excellent specificity compared to the human experts (87.25% vs. 58.17%). However, the human experts were superior in sensitivity (80.00% vs. 57.43%) (all p < 0.001). In gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) visualizations, the fine-tuning scheme focused more on effusion than on other structures of the TMJ, and the sparsity was higher than that of the from-scratch scheme (82.40% vs. 49.83%, p < 0.05). The Grad-CAM visualizations agreed with the model learned through important features in the TMJ area, particularly around the articular disc. Two fine-tuning models on PD and T2-weighted images showed that the diagnostic performance did not improve compared with using PD alone (p < 0.05). Diverse AUCs were observed across each group when the patients were divided according to age (0.7083–0.8375) and sex (male:0.7576, female:0.7083). The prediction accuracy of the ensemble model was higher than that of the human experts when all the data were used (74.21% vs. 67.71%, p < 0.05). A deep neural network (DNN) was developed to process multimodal data, including MRI and patient clinical data. Analysis of four age groups with the DNN model showed that the 41–60 age group had the best performance (AUC = 0.8258). The fine-tuning model and DNN were optimal for judging TMJ effusion and may be used to prevent true negative cases and aid in human diagnostic performance. Assistive automated diagnostic methods have the potential to increase clinicians’ diagnostic accuracy."

        "abstract": "Liver fibrosis progressing to cirrhosis is a major risk factor for liver cancer, impacting surgical treatment and survival. Our study focuses on the role of extracellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (eNAD+) in liver fibrosis, analyzing liver disease patients undergoing surgery. Additionally, we explore NAD+’s therapeutic potential in a mouse model of extended liver resection and in vitro using 3D hepatocyte spheroids. eNAD+ correlated with aspartate transaminase (AST) and bilirubin after liver resection (AST: r = 0.2828, p = 0.0087; Bilirubin: r = 0.2584, p = 0.0176). Concordantly, post-hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF) was associated with higher eNAD+ peaks (n = 10; p = 0.0063). Post-operative eNAD+ levels decreased significantly (p < 0.05), but in advanced stages of liver fibrosis or cirrhosis, this decline not only diminished but actually showed a trend towards an increase. The expression of NAD+ biosynthesis rate-limiting enzymes, nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) and nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase 3 (NMNAT3), were upregulated significantly in the liver tissue of patients with higher liver fibrosis stages (p < 0.0001). Finally, the administration of NAD+ in a 3D hepatocyte spheroid model rescued hepatocytes from TNFalpha-induced cell death and improved viability (p < 0.0001). In a mouse model of extended liver resection, NAD+ treatment significantly improved survival (p = 0.0158) and liver regeneration (p = 0.0186). Our findings reveal that eNAD+ was upregulated in PHLF, and rate-limiting enzymes of NAD+ biosynthesis demonstrated higher expressions under liver fibrosis. Further, eNAD+ administration improved survival after extended liver resection in mice and enhanced hepatocyte viability in vitro. These insights may offer a potential target for future therapies."

At day 180, the cumulative incidence (CI) of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was significantly lower in mIDH1 and mIDH2 compared to no-IDH groups (Hazard ratio [HR] = 0.66 (95% CI 0.47–0.91), p = 0.011; HR = 0.73 (95% CI 0.56–0.96), p = 0.025, respectively). In the mIDH1 group, overall survival (OS) was improved compared to no-IDH (HR = 0.68 (95% CI 0.48–0.94), p = 0.021), whereas mIDH2 was associated with lower incidence of relapse (HR = 0.49 (95% CI 0.34–0.7), p < 0.001), improved leukemia free survival (LFS) (HR = 0.7 (95% CI 0.55–0.9), p = 0.004) and OS (HR = 0.74 (95% CI 0.56–0.97), p = 0.027).

This is a multicenter study involving 288 patients from a major medical center as the training group, and 75 patients from two other medical centers as the testing group. Data regarding the presence of spinal cord injury symptoms and their recovery status within 72 h were documented. These patients underwent sagittal T1-weighted and T2-weighted imaging using cervical magnetic resonance imaging. Radiomics techniques are used to help diagnose whether these patients have cervical spinal cord injury or spinal cord concussion. 1197 radiomics features were extracted for each modality of each patient. The accuracy of T1 modal in testing group is 0.773, AUC is 0.799. The accuracy of T2 modal in testing group is 0.707, AUC is 0.813. The accuracy of T1 + T2 modal in testing group is 0.800, AUC is 0.840.

This study, focusing on a retrospective cohort of 4778 COVID-19 patients from Iran, explores the performance of various FS methods, including filter, embedded, and hybrid approaches, in predicting mortality outcomes. The researchers leveraged 115 routine clinical, laboratory, and demographic features and employed 13 ML models to assess the effectiveness of these FS methods based on classification accuracy, predictive accuracy, and statistical tests. The results indicate that a Hybrid Boruta-VI model combined with the Random Forest algorithm demonstrated superior performance, achieving an accuracy of 0.89, an F1 score of 0.76, and an AUC value of 0.95 on test data. Key variables identified as important predictors of adverse outcomes include age, oxygen saturation levels, albumin levels, neutrophil counts, platelet levels, and markers of kidney function. These findings highlight the potential of advanced FS techniques and ML models in enhancing early disease detection and informing clinical decision-making."

The objective of this study was to develop a method for cryopreserving blood cells under the specific constraints of the ISS. In a ground experiment, mouse blood was directly mixed with a cryoprotectant and gradually frozen at −80 °C. Thawing the frozen blood sample resulted in the successful recovery of viable mononuclear cells when using a mixed solution of dimethylsulfoxide and hydroxyethyl starch as a cryoprotectant. In addition, we developed new freezing cases to minimize storage space utilization within the ISS freezer. Finally, we confirmed the recovery of major mononuclear immune cell subsets from the cryopreserved blood cells through a high dimensional analysis of flow cytometric data using 13 cell surface markers. Consequently, this ground study lays the foundation for the cryopreservation of viable blood cells on the ISS, enabling their analysis upon return to Earth. The application of this method in ISS studies will contribute to understanding the impact of space environments on human cells. Moreover, this method may find application in the cryopreservation of blood cells in situations where research facilities are inadequate."

Data from the Canadian Immunization Research Network’s Serious Outcomes Surveillance Network (2011/2012–2018/2019 influenza seasons) enabled the selecting of all laboratory-confirmed influenza patients. A machine learning-based approach then identified variables, generated weighted scores, and evaluated model performance. This study included 12,954 patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza infections. The optimal scale encompassed ten variables: demographic (age and sex), health history (smoking status, chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, and influenza vaccination status), clinical presentation (cough, sputum production, and shortness of breath), and function (need for regular support for activities of daily living). As a continuous variable, the scale had an AU-ROC of 0.73 (95% CI, 0.71–0.74). Aggregated scores classified participants into three risk categories: low (ISS < 30; 79.9% sensitivity, 51% specificity), moderate (ISS ≥ 30 but < 50; 54.5% sensitivity, 55.9% specificity), and high (ISS ≥ 50; 51.4% sensitivity, 80.5% specificity).

A key strategy to combat myopia is with early detection and prediction in children as such examination allows for effective intervention using readily accessible imaging technique. To this end, we introduced DeepMyopia, an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled decision support system to detect and predict myopia onset and facilitate targeted interventions for children at risk using routine retinal fundus images. Based on deep learning architecture, DeepMyopia had been trained and internally validated on a large cohort of retinal fundus images (n = 1,638,315) and then externally tested on datasets from seven sites in China (n = 22,060). Our results demonstrated robustness of DeepMyopia, with AUCs of 0.908, 0.813, and 0.810 for 1-, 2-, and 3-year myopia onset prediction with the internal test set, and AUCs of 0.796, 0.808, and 0.767 with the external test set. DeepMyopia also effectively stratified children into low- and high-risk groups (p < 0.001) in both test sets. In an emulated randomized controlled trial (eRCT) on the Shanghai outdoor cohort (n = 3303) where DeepMyopia showed effectiveness in myopia prevention compared to NonCyc-based model, with an adjusted relative reduction (ARR) of −17.8%, 95% CI: −29.4%, −6.4%. DeepMyopia-assisted interventions attained quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of 0.75 (95% CI: 0.53, 1.04) per person and avoided blindness years of 13.54 (95% CI: 9.57, 18.83) per 1 million persons compared to natural lifestyle with no active intervention.

We used Support Vector Machine, Learning Using Concave and Convex Kernels, and Random Forest to predict an increase in qSOFA score using electronic health record (EHR) data, electrocardiograms (ECG), and arterial line signals. We structured physiological signals data in a tensor format and used Canonical Polyadic/Parallel Factors (CP) decomposition for feature reduction. Random Forests trained on ECG data show improved performance after tensor decomposition for predictions in a 6-h time frame (AUROC 0.67 ± 0.06 compared to 0.57 ± 0.08, \\(p = 0.01\\)). Adding arterial line features can also improve performance (AUROC 0.69 ± 0.07, \\(p < 0.01\\)), and benefit from tensor decomposition (AUROC 0.71 ± 0.07, \\(p = 0.01\\)). Adding EHR data features to a tensor-reduced signal model further improves performance (AUROC 0.77 ± 0.06, \\(p < 0.01\\)). Despite reduction in performance going from an EHR data-informed model to a tensor-reduced waveform data model, the signals-informed model offers distinct advantages. The first is that predictions can be made on a continuous basis in real-time, and second is that these predictions are not limited by the availability of EHR data. Additionally, structuring the waveform features as a tensor conserves structural and temporal information that would otherwise be lost if the data were presented as flat vectors."

        "abstract": "Effective interventions for neuropsychiatric disorders may work by rebalancing the brain’s functional hierarchical organization. Here we directly investigated the effects of two different serotonergic pharmacological interventions on functional brain hierarchy in major depressive disorder in a two-arm double-blind phase II randomized controlled trial comparing psilocybin therapy (22 patients) with escitalopram (20 patients). Patients with major depressive disorder received either 2 × 25 mg of oral psilocybin, three weeks apart, plus six weeks of daily placebo (‘psilocybin arm’) or 2 × 1 mg of oral psilocybin, three weeks apart, plus six weeks of daily escitalopram (10–20 mg; ‘escitalopram arm’). Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans were acquired at baseline and three weeks after the second psilocybin dose (NCT03429075). The brain mechanisms were captured by generative effective connectivity, estimated from whole-brain modeling of resting state for each session and patient. Hierarchy was determined for each of these sessions using measures of directedness and trophic levels on the effective connectivity, which captures cycle structure, stability and percolation. The results showed that the two pharmacological interventions created significantly different hierarchical reconfigurations of whole-brain dynamics with differential, opposite statistical effect responses. Furthermore, the use of machine learning revealed significant differential reorganization of brain hierarchy before and after the two treatments. Machine learning was also able to predict treatment response with an accuracy of 0.85 ± 0.04. Overall, the results demonstrate that psilocybin and escitalopram work in different ways for rebalancing brain dynamics in depression. This suggests the hypothesis that neuropsychiatric disorders could be closely linked to the breakdown in regions orchestrating brain dynamics from the top of the hierarchy."

We comprehensively characterized autofluorescence (AF) spectra in diverse murine tissues—ocular globe, knee, and liver—employing LSFM under various excitation wavelengths (405–785 nm) to test the feasibility of unstained samples for diagnostic purposes, in particular regarding percutaneous biopsies, as they constitute to most harvested type of tissue sample in clinical routine. Ocular globe structures were best discerned with 640 nm excitation. Knee tissue showed complex variation in AF spectra variation influenced by tissue depth and structure. Liver exhibited a unique AF pattern, likely linked to vasculature. Hepatic tissue samples were used to demonstrate the compatibility of our protocol for antibody staining. Furthermore, we employed machine learning to augment raw images and segment liver structures based on AF spectra. Radiologists rated representative samples transferred to the clinical assessment software. Learning-generated images scored highest in quality. Additionally, we investigated an actual murine biopsy. Our study pioneers the application of AF spectra for tissue characterization and diagnostic potential of optically cleared unstained percutaneous biopsies, contributing to the clinical translation of LSFM."

While there are many large public MRI datasets, few of these include acute stroke. We describe clinical MRI using diffusion-weighted, fluid-attenuated and T1-weighted modalities for 1715 individuals admitted in the upstate of South Carolina, of whom 1461 have acute ischemic stroke. Demographic and impairment data are provided for 1106 of the stroke survivors from this cohort. Our validation demonstrates that machine learning can leverage the imaging data to predict stroke severity as measured by the NIH Stroke Scale/Score (NIHSS).

Here, we used objective neurobehavioural measures (eye-tracking) to see how physicians respond to XAI with N = 19 ICU physicians in a hospital’s clinical simulation suite. Prescription decisions were made both pre- and post-reveal of either a safe or unsafe AI recommendation and four different types of simultaneously presented XAI. We used overt visual attention as a marker for where physician mental attention was directed during the simulations. Unsafe AI recommendations attracted significantly greater attention than safe AI recommendations. However, there was no appreciably higher level of attention placed onto any of the four types of explanation during unsafe AI scenarios (i.e. XAI did not appear to ‘rescue’ decision-makers). Furthermore, self-reported usefulness of explanations by physicians did not correlate with the level of attention they devoted to the explanations reinforcing the notion that using self-reports alone to evaluate XAI tools misses key aspects of the interaction behaviour between human and machine."

We conducted a retrospective observational study by applying dynamic clinical data collected in the ARDSNet FACTT Trial (n = 1000) to ML-based algorithms for predicting mortality. In order to compare the significance of clinical features dynamically, we further applied the random forest (RF) model to nine selected clinical parameters acquired at baseline and day 3 independently. An RF model trained using clinical data collected at day 3 showed improved performance and prognostication efficacy (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.78–0.89) compared to baseline with an AUC value of 0.72 (95% CI: 0.65–0.78). Mean airway pressure (MAP), bicarbonate, age, platelet count, albumin, heart rate, and glucose were the most significant clinical indicators associated with mortality at day 3. Thus, clinical features collected early (day 3) improved performance of integrative ML models with better prognostication for mortality. Among these, MAP represented the most important feature for ARDS patients’ early risk stratification."

        "abstract": "Bimodal convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are frequently combined with patient information or several medical images to enhance the diagnostic performance. However, the technologies that integrate automatically generated clinical measurements within the images are scarce. Hence, we developed a bimodal model that produced automatic algorithm for clinical measurement (aaCM) from radiographic images and integrated the model with CNNs. In this multicenter research project, the diagnostic performance of the model was investigated with 813 radiographic hip images of infants at risk of developmental dysplasia of the hips (232 and 581 images of unstable and stable hips, respectively), with the ground truth defined by provocative examinations. The results indicated that the accuracy of aaCM was equal or higher than that of specialists, and the bimodal model showed better diagnostic performance than LightGBM, XGBoost, SVM, and single CNN models. aaCM can provide expert’s knowledge in a high level, and our proposed bimodal model has better performance than the state-of-art models."

        "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) impacts about 1 in 7 adults in the United States, but African Americans (AAs) carry a disproportionately higher burden of disease. Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation at cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites, have been linked to kidney function and may have clinical utility in predicting the risk of CKD. Given the dynamic relationship between the epigenome, environment, and disease, AAs may be especially sensitive to environment-driven methylation alterations. Moreover, risk models incorporating CpG methylation have been shown to predict disease across multiple racial groups. In this study, we developed a methylation risk score (MRS) for CKD in cohorts of AAs. We selected nine CpG sites that were previously reported to be associated with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in epigenome-wide association studies to construct a MRS in the Hypertension Genetic Epidemiology Network (HyperGEN). In logistic mixed models, the MRS was significantly associated with prevalent CKD and was robust to multiple sensitivity analyses, including CKD risk factors. There was modest replication in validation cohorts. In summary, we demonstrated that an eGFR-based CpG score is an independent predictor of prevalent CKD, suggesting that MRS should be further investigated for clinical utility in evaluating CKD risk and progression."

However, gaps were detected in the role of intestinal microbiome in cerebral vasospasm (CVS) after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). This is the first pilot study aiming to test study feasibility and identify differences in gut microbiota between subjects with and without CVS following aSAH. A prospective nested case–control pilot study with 1:1 matching was conducted recruiting subjects with aSAH: cases with CVS; and controls without CVS based on the clinical picture and structured bedside transcranial Doppler (TCD). Fecal samples for microbiota analyses by means of 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing were collected within the first 96 h after ictus. Operational taxonomic unit tables were constructed, diversity metrics calculated, phylogenetic trees built, and differential abundance analysis (DAA) performed. At baseline, the groups did not differ significantly in basic demographic and aneurysm-related characteristics (p > 0.05). Alpha-diversity (richness and Shannon Index) was significantly reduced in cases of middle cerebral artery (MCA) vasospasm (p < 0.05). In DAA, relative abundance of genus Acidaminococcus was associated with MCA vasospasm (p = 0.00013). Two butyrate-producing genera, Intestinimonas and Butyricimonas, as well as [Clostridium] innocuum group had the strongest negative correlation with the mean blood flow velocity in anterior cerebral arteries (p < 0.01; rho = − 0.63; − 0.57, and − 0.57, respectively). In total, 16 gut microbial genera were identified to correlate with TCD parameters, and two intestinal genera correlated with outcome upon discharge. In this pilot study, we prove study feasibility and present the first preliminary evidence of gut microbiome signature associating with CVS as a significant cause of stroke in subjects with aSAH."

Clinical decision support tools predicting transplant outcomes are lacking. This project uses interpretable methods to predict both graft failure and patient death using data from previously accepted kidney transplant offers. Using more than 25 years of transplant outcome data, we train and compare several survival analysis models in single risk settings. In addition, we use post hoc interpretability techniques to clinically validate these models. Neural networks show comparable performance to the Cox proportional hazard model, with concordance of 0.63 and 0.79 for prediction of graft failure and patient death, respectively. Donor and recipient ages, the number of mismatches at DR locus, dialysis type, and primary renal disease appear to be important features for transplant outcome prediction. Owing to their good predictive performance and the clinical relevance of their post hoc interpretation, neural networks represent a promising core component in the construction of future decision support systems for transplant offering."

Accurate prediction of motor function recovery is extremely important for formulating effective diagnosis, therapeutic and rehabilitation programs. The aim of this study is to investigate the validity of a novel nested ensemble algorithm that uses the very early ASIA motor score (AMS) of ISNCSCI examination to predict motor function recovery 6 months after injury in TCSCI patients. This retrospective study included complete data of 315 TCSCI patients. The dataset consisting of the first AMS at ≤ 24 h post-injury and follow-up AMS at 6 months post-injury was divided into a training set (80%) and a test set (20%). The nested ensemble algorithm was established in a two-stage manner. Support Vector Classification (SVC), Adaboost, Weak-learner and Dummy were used in the first stage, and Adaboost was selected as second-stage model. The prediction results of the first stage models were uploaded into second-stage model to obtain the final prediction results. The model performance was evaluated using precision, recall, accuracy, F1 score, and confusion matrix. The nested ensemble algorithm was applied to predict motor function recovery of TCSCI, achieving an accuracy of 80.6%, a F1 score of 80.6%, and balancing sensitivity and specificity. The confusion matrix showed few false-negative rate, which has crucial practical implications for prognostic prediction of TCSCI. This novel nested ensemble algorithm, simply based on very early AMS, provides a useful tool for predicting motor function recovery 6 months after TCSCI, which is graded in gradients that progressively improve the accuracy and reliability of the prediction, demonstrating a strong potential of ensemble learning to personalize and optimize the rehabilitation and care of TCSCI patients."

The aim of this study was to establish and validate a preoperative CT-based deep learning (DL) signature to predict BMFS in NSCLC patients. We performed a retrospective analysis of 1547 NSCLC patients who underwent complete surgical resection, followed by at least 36 months of monitoring at two hospitals. We constructed a DL signature from multiparametric CT images using 3D convolutional neural networks, and we integrated this signature with clinical-imaging factors to establish a deep learning clinical-imaging signature (DLCS). We evaluated performance using Harrell’s concordance index (C-index) and the time-dependent receiver operating characteristic. We also assessed the risk of bone metastasis (BM) in NSCLC patients at different clinical stages using DLCS. The DL signature successfully predicted BM, with C-indexes of 0.799 and 0.818 for the validation cohorts. DLCS outperformed the DL signature with corresponding C-indexes of 0.806 and 0.834. Ranges for area under the curve at 1, 2, and 3 years were 0.820–0.865 for internal and 0.860–0.884 for external validation cohorts. Furthermore, DLCS successfully stratified patients with different clinical stages of NSCLC as high- and low-risk groups for BM (p < 0.05). CT-based DL can predict BMFS in NSCLC patients undergoing complete surgical resection, and may assist in the assessment of BM risk for patients at different clinical stages."

        "abstract": "Accurate intraoperative assessment of organ perfusion is a pivotal determinant in preserving organ function e.g. during kidney surgery including partial nephrectomy or kidney transplantation. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) has great potential to objectively describe and quantify this perfusion as opposed to conventional surrogate techniques such as ultrasound flowmeter, indocyanine green or the subjective eye of the surgeon. An established live porcine model under general anesthesia received median laparotomy and renal mobilization. Different scenarios that were measured using HSI were (1) complete, (2) gradual and (3) partial malperfusion. The differences in spectral reflectance as well as HSI oxygenation (StO2) between different perfusion states were compelling and as high as 56.9% with 70.3% (± 11.0%) for “physiological” vs. 13.4% (± 3.1%) for “venous congestion”. A machine learning (ML) algorithm was able to distinguish between these perfusion states with a balanced prediction accuracy of 97.8%. Data from this porcine study including 1300 recordings across 57 individuals was compared to a human dataset of 104 recordings across 17 individuals suggesting clinical transferability. Therefore, HSI is a highly promising tool for intraoperative microvascular evaluation of perfusion states with great advantages over existing surrogate techniques. Clinical trials are required to prove patient benefit."

A retrospective study of 477 children with suspected pertussis at Zigong First People’s Hospital was performed between January 2020 and December 2021. The patients were randomly divided into training cohort and validation cohort. Stepwise regression and R software was performed to develop and validate the model. Stepwise regression analysis showed that white blood cell (WBC), hematocrit (HCT), lymphocyte (LYMPH), C-reactive protein (CRP) and platelet distribution width to mean platelet volume ratio (PDW-MPV-R) were found to be independent factors associated with pertussis. The model containing WBC, CRP and PDW-MPV-R had the best performance. The area under curve (ROC, 0.77 for the training cohort and 0.80 for the validation cohort) of the model indicated satisfactory discriminative ability. The sensitivity and specificity of the model were 72.1% and 72.6% in training cohort and 74% and 72.1%, respectively, in validation cohort. Based on the ROC analysis, calibration plots, and decision curve analysis, we concluded that the model exhibited excellent performance. A model based on blood parameters is sufficiently accurate to predict the probability of pertussis in children, and may provide some reference for clinical decisions."

Adults with unselected acute diseases managed by the EMS and evacuated with discharge priority to emergency departments were considered between January 1, 2020, and June 30, 2023. Prehospital point-of-care testing and on-scene vital signs were used for the unsupervised machine learning method (clustering) to determine the phenotypes. Then phenotypes were compared with the primary outcome (cumulative mortality (all-cause) at 2, 7, and 30 days). A total of 7909 patients were included. The median (IQR) age was 64 (51–80) years, 41% were women, and 26% were living in rural areas. Three clusters were identified: alpha 16.2% (1281 patients), beta 28.8% (2279), and gamma 55% (4349). The mortality rates for alpha, beta and gamma at 2 days were 18.6%, 4.1%, and 0.8%, respectively; at 7 days, were 24.7%, 6.2%, and 1.7%; and at 30 days, were 33%, 10.2%, and 3.2%, respectively. Based on standard vital signs and blood test biomarkers in the prehospital scenario, three clusters were identified: alpha (high-risk), beta and gamma (medium- and low-risk, respectively).

Unbiased deconvolution of the spatial data identifies the following four distinct microenvironments: glomerular, immune, tubule and fibrotic. We describe the complex organization of microenvironments in health and disease and find that the fibrotic microenvironment is able to molecularly classify human kidneys and offers an improved prognosis compared to traditional histopathology.

Hence, there is an urgent necessity for an efficient method to detect and predict seizures in order to mitigate the risks faced by epilepsy patients. In this paper, a new method for seizure detection and prediction is proposed, which is based on multi-class feature fusion and the convolutional neural network-gated recurrent unit-attention mechanism (CNN-GRU-AM) model. Initially, the Electroencephalography (EEG) signal undergoes wavelet decomposition through the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), resulting in six subbands. Subsequently, time–frequency domain and nonlinear features are extracted from each subband. Finally, the CNN-GRU-AM further extracts features and performs classification. The CHB-MIT dataset is used to validate the proposed approach. The results of tenfold cross validation show that our method achieved a sensitivity of 99.24% and 95.47%, specificity of 99.51% and 94.93%, accuracy of 99.35% and 95.16%, and an AUC of 99.34% and 95.15% in seizure detection and prediction tasks, respectively.

Employing deep learning, a prominent subset of machine learning algorithms, the study deploys convolutional neural network (CNN) models to excavate profound attributes inherent in the skull CT images. In pursuit of the research objective, the focal methodology involves the exclusive application of deep learning algorithms to image datasets, culminating in an accuracy rate of 96.4%. The gender estimation process exhibits a precision of 96.1% for male individuals and 96.8% for female individuals. The precision performance varies across different selections of feature numbers, namely 100, 300, and 500, alongside 1000 features without feature selection. The respective precision rates for these selections are recorded as 95.0%, 95.5%, 96.2%, and 96.4%. It is notable that gender estimation via visual radiography mitigates the discrepancy in measurements between experts, concurrently yielding an expedited estimation rate. Predicated on the empirical findings of this investigation, it is inferred that the efficacy of the CNN model, the configurational intricacies of the classifier, and the judicious selection of features collectively constitute pivotal determinants in shaping the performance attributes of the proposed methodology."

Genome sequences follow rules similar to natural language but are distinct in the absence of a concept of words. We established byte-pair encoding on the human genome and trained a foundation language model called GROVER (Genome Rules Obtained Via Extracted Representations) with the vocabulary selected via a custom task, next-k-mer prediction. The defined dictionary of tokens in the human genome carries best the information content for GROVER. Analysing learned representations, we observed that trained token embeddings primarily encode information related to frequency, sequence content and length. Some tokens are primarily localized in repeats, whereas the majority widely distribute over the genome. GROVER also learns context and lexical ambiguity. Average trained embeddings of genomic regions relate to functional genomics annotation and thus indicate learning of these structures purely from the contextual relationships of tokens. This highlights the extent of information content encoded by the sequence that can be grasped by GROVER. On fine-tuning tasks addressing genome biology with questions of genome element identification and protein–DNA binding, GROVER exceeds other models’ performance. GROVER learns sequence context, a sense for structure and language rules. Extracting this knowledge can be used to compose a grammar book for the code of life."

Integrated algorithms were developed, and four machine-learning algorithms were used. Selected characteristics included common demographic data, biochemical indicators, and vital signs. Eight key variables were selected using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator and Random Forest Algorithm. Thrombocytopenia occurred in 18.2% of postoperative geriatric patients, with a higher mortality rate. The C5.0 model showed the best performance, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve close to 0.85, along with unparalleled accuracy, precision, specificity, recall, and balanced accuracy scores of 0.88, 0.98, 0.89, 0.98, and 0.85, respectively.

A complex operational pipeline was defined to implement data cleaning and image transformations, and train two DL models. The state-of-the-art neural network architectures (Yolov7, ConvNeXt, RegNetX) and advanced techniques were exploited to aggregate the results (Ensemble learning, Edge detection) and obtain a final model. The DL approach reached good performance in detecting HE and classifying DRIL. Regarding HE detection the model got an AP@0.5 score equal to 34.4% with Precision of 48.7% and Recall of 43.1%; while for DRIL classification an Accuracy of 91.1% with Sensitivity and Specificity both of 91.1% and AUC and AUPR values equal to 91% were obtained. The P-value was lower than 0.05 and the Kappa coefficient was 0.82. The DL models proved to be able to identify HE and DRIL in eyes with DME with a very good accuracy and all the metrics calculated confirmed the system performance. Our DL approach demonstrated to be a good candidate as a supporting tool for ophthalmologists in OCT images analysis."

        "abstract": "Exoskeleton-based support for patients requires the learning of individual machine-learning models to recognize movement intentions of patients based on the electroencephalogram (EEG). A major issue in EEG-based movement intention recognition is the long calibration time required to train a model. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning approach that eliminates the need for a calibration session. This approach is validated on healthy subjects in this study. We will use the proposed approach in our future rehabilitation application, where the movement intention of the affected arm of a patient can be inferred from the EEG data recorded during bilateral arm movements enabled by the exoskeleton mirroring arm movements from the unaffected to the affected arm. For the initial evaluation, we compared two trained models for predicting unilateral and bilateral movement intentions without applying a classifier transfer. For the main evaluation, we predicted unilateral movement intentions without a calibration session by transferring the classifier trained on data from bilateral movement intentions. Our results showed that the classification performance for the transfer case was comparable to that in the non-transfer case, even with only 4 or 8 EEG channels. Our results contribute to robotic rehabilitation by eliminating the need for a calibration session, since EEG data for training is recorded during the rehabilitation session, and only a small number of EEG channels are required for model training."

Conventional determination of PD-L1 status includes careful surgical or biopsied tumor specimens. These specimens are gathered through invasive procedures, representing a risk of difficulties and potential challenges in getting reliable and representative tissue samples. Using a single center cohort of 189 patients, our objective was to evaluate various fusion methods that used non-invasive computed tomography (CT) and \\(^{18}\\)F-FDG positron emission tomography (PET) images as inputs to various deep learning models to automatically predict PD-L1 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We compared three different architectures (ResNet, DenseNet, and EfficientNet) and considered different input data (CT only, PET only, PET/CT early fusion, PET/CT late fusion without as well as with partially and fully shared weights to determine the best model performance. Models were assessed utilizing areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) considering their 95% confidence intervals (CI). The fusion of PET and CT images as input yielded better performance for PD-L1 classification. The different data fusion schemes systematically outperformed their individual counterparts when used as input of the various deep models. Furthermore, early fusion consistently outperformed late fusion, probably as a result of its capacity to capture more complicated patterns by merging PET and CT derived content at a lower level. When we looked more closely at the effects of weight sharing in late fusion architectures, we discovered that while it might boost model stability, it did not always result in better results. This suggests that although weight sharing could be beneficial when modality parameters are similar, the anatomical and metabolic information provided by CT and PET scans are too dissimilar to consistently lead to improved PD-L1 status predictions."

The effectiveness of a custom-made VR simulator and an AI-based evaluator of a laparoscopic peg transfer exercise was investigated. Sixty medical students were involved in a single-blinded randomised controlled study to compare the VR simulator with the traditional box trainer. A total of 240 peg transfer exercises from the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery programme were analysed. The experts and AI-based software used the same criteria for evaluation. The algorithm detected pitfalls and measured exercise duration. Skill improvement showed no significant difference between the VR and control groups. The AI-based evaluator exhibited 95% agreement with the manual assessment. The average difference between the exercise durations measured by the two evaluation methods was 2.61 s. The duration of the algorithmic assessment was 59.47 s faster than the manual assessment. The VR simulator was an effective alternative practice compared with the training box simulator. The AI-based evaluation produced similar results compared with the manual assessment, and it could significantly reduce the evaluation time.

This study aims to identify machine learning models with an optimal diagnostic performance for intraoperative transfusion prediction in parturients undergoing a CS. Additionally, to address model performance degradation due to data imbalance, this study further investigated the variation in predictive model performance depending on the ratio of event to non-event data (1:1, 1:2, 1:3, and 1:4 model datasets and raw data).The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) were evaluated to compare the predictive accuracy of different machine learning algorithms, including XGBoost, K-nearest neighbor, decision tree, support vector machine, multilayer perceptron, logistic regression, random forest, and deep neural network. We compared the predictive performance of eight prediction algorithms that were applied to five types of datasets. The intraoperative transfusion in maternal CS was 7.2% (1020/14,254). XGBoost showed the highest AUROC (0.8257) and AUPRC (0.4825) among the models. The most significant predictors for transfusion in maternal CS as per machine learning models were placenta previa totalis, haemoglobin, placenta previa partialis, and platelets. In all eight prediction algorithms, the change in predictive performance based on the AUROC and AUPRC according to the resampling ratio was insignificant. The XGBoost algorithm exhibited optimal performance for predicting intraoperative transfusion. Data balancing techniques employed to alter the event data composition ratio of the training data failed to improve the performance of the prediction model."

We developed DenseNet-121 and EfficientNet-v2-M convolutional neural network models to analyze 4933 skull X-ray images collected from 1343 infants. Notably, allowing for a ± 1 month error margin, DenseNet-121 reached a maximum corrected accuracy of 79.4% for anteroposterior (AP) views (average: 78.0 ± 1.5%) and 84.2% for lateral views (average: 81.1 ± 2.9%). EfficientNet-v2-M reached a maximum corrected accuracy 79.1% for AP views (average: 77.0 ± 2.3%) and 87.3% for lateral views (average: 85.1 ± 2.5%). Saliency maps identified critical discriminative areas in skull radiographs, including the coronal, sagittal, and metopic sutures in AP skull X-ray images, and the lambdoid suture and cortical bone density in lateral images, marking them as indicators for evaluating cranial development. These findings highlight the precision of deep learning in estimating infant age through non-invasive methods, offering the progress for clinical diagnostics and developmental assessment tools."

We hypothesized that machine learning utilizing paired tissue microbiome and plasma metabolome features could uncover distinct host-microbiome associations between eoCRC and average-onset CRC (aoCRC). Individuals with stages I–IV CRC (n = 64) were categorized as eoCRC (age ≤ 50, n = 20) or aoCRC (age ≥ 60, n = 44). Untargeted plasma metabolomics and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing (microbiome analysis) of tumor tissue were performed. We fit DIABLO (Data Integration Analysis for Biomarker Discovery using Latent variable approaches for Omics studies) to construct a supervised machine-learning classifier using paired multi-omics (microbiome and metabolomics) data and identify associations unique to eoCRC. A differential association network analysis was also performed. Distinct clustering patterns emerged in multi-omic dimension reduction analysis. The metabolomics classifier achieved an AUC of 0.98, compared to AUC 0.61 for microbiome-based classifier. Circular correlation technique highlighted several key associations. Metabolites glycerol and pseudouridine (higher abundance in individuals with aoCRC) had negative correlations with Parasutterella, and Ruminococcaceae (higher abundance in individuals with eoCRC). Cholesterol and xylitol correlated negatively with Erysipelatoclostridium and Eubacterium, and showed a positive correlation with Acidovorax with higher abundance in individuals with eoCRC. Network analysis revealed different clustering patterns and associations for several metabolites e.g.: urea cycle metabolites and microbes such as Akkermansia. We show that multi-omics analysis can be utilized to study host-microbiome correlations in eoCRC and demonstrates promising biomarker potential of a metabolomics classifier. The distinct host-microbiome correlations for urea cycle in eoCRC may offer opportunities for therapeutic interventions."

        "abstract": "The microarray gene expression data poses a tremendous challenge due to their curse of dimensionality problem. The sheer volume of features far surpasses available samples, leading to overfitting and reduced classification accuracy. Thus the dimensionality of microarray gene expression data must be reduced with efficient feature extraction methods to reduce the volume of data and extract meaningful information to enhance the classification accuracy and interpretability. In this research, we discover the uniqueness of applying STFT (Short Term Fourier Transform), LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator), and EHO (Elephant Herding Optimisation) for extracting significant features from lung cancer and reducing the dimensionality of the microarray gene expression database. The classification of lung cancer is performed using the following classifiers: Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) with GMM, Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA), Naive Bayes classifier (NBC), Firefly with GMM, Support Vector Machine with Radial Basis Kernel (SVM-RBF) and Flower Pollination Optimization (FPO) with GMM. The EHO feature extraction with the FPO-GMM classifier attained the highest accuracy in the range of 96.77, with an F1 score of 97.5, MCC of 0.92 and Kappa of 0.92. The reported results underline the significance of utilizing STFT, LASSO, and EHO for feature extraction in reducing the dimensionality of microarray gene expression data. These methodologies also help in improved and early diagnosis of lung cancer with enhanced classification accuracy and interpretability."

As their clinical symptoms and image appearances on conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be astonishingly similar, their accurate differentiation based solely on clinical and radiological information can be very challenging, particularly for “cancer of unknown primary”, where no systemic malignancy is known or found. Non-invasive multiparametric MRI and radiomics offer the potential to identify these distinct biological properties, aiding in the characterization and differentiation of HGGs and BMs. However, there is a scarcity of publicly available multi-origin brain tumor imaging data for tumor characterization. In this paper, we introduce a multi-center, multi-origin brain tumor MRI (MOTUM) imaging dataset obtained from 67 patients: 29 with high-grade gliomas, 20 with lung metastases, 10 with breast metastases, 2 with gastric metastasis, 4 with ovarian metastasis, and 2 with melanoma metastasis. This dataset includes anonymized DICOM files alongside processed FLAIR, T1-weighted, contrast-enhanced T1-weighted, T2-weighted sequences images, segmentation masks of two tumor regions, and clinical data. Our data-sharing initiative is to support the benchmarking of automated tumor segmentation, multi-modal machine learning, and disease differentiation of multi-origin brain tumors in a multi-center setting."

In animal models, psilocybin induces neuroplasticity in cortex and hippocampus5,6,7,8. It remains unclear how human brain network changes relate to subjective and lasting effects of psychedelics. Here we tracked individual-specific brain changes with longitudinal precision functional mapping (roughly 18 magnetic resonance imaging visits per participant). Healthy adults were tracked before, during and for 3 weeks after high-dose psilocybin (25 mg) and methylphenidate (40 mg), and brought back for an additional psilocybin dose 6–12 months later. Psilocybin massively disrupted functional connectivity (FC) in cortex and subcortex, acutely causing more than threefold greater change than methylphenidate. These FC changes were driven by brain desynchronization across spatial scales (areal, global), which dissolved network distinctions by reducing correlations within and anticorrelations between networks. Psilocybin-driven FC changes were strongest in the default mode network, which is connected to the anterior hippocampus and is thought to create our sense of space, time and self. Individual differences in FC changes were strongly linked to the subjective psychedelic experience. Performing a perceptual task reduced psilocybin-driven FC changes. Psilocybin caused persistent decrease in FC between the anterior hippocampus and default mode network, lasting for weeks. Persistent reduction of hippocampal-default mode network connectivity may represent a neuroanatomical and mechanistic correlate of the proplasticity and therapeutic effects of psychedelics."

Accurately diagnosing and differentiating acute appendicitis can assist clinicians in formulating a scientific and reasonable treatment plan and providing high-quality medical services for the elderly. In this study, we validated and analyzed the different performances of various machine learning models based on the analysis of clinical data, so as to construct a simple, fast, and accurate estimation method for the diagnosis of early acute appendicitis. The dataset of this paper was obtained from the medical data of elderly patients with acute appendicitis attending the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui University of Chinese Medicine from January 2012 to January 2022, including 196 males (60.87%) and 126 females (39.13%), including 103 (31.99%) patients with complicated appendicitis and 219 (68.01%) patients with uncomplicated appendicitis. By comparing and analyzing the prediction results of the models implemented by nine different machine learning techniques (LR, CART, RF, SVM, Bayes, KNN, NN, FDA, and GBM), we found that the GBM algorithm gave the optimal results and that sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, precision, recall, F1 and brier are 0.9167, 0.9739, 0.9429, 0.9613, 0.9429, 0.9167, 0.9296, and 0.05649, respectively.

Governance, privacy concerns and the cost of acquisition all restrict access to medical imaging data, which, compounded by the data-hungry nature of deep learning algorithms, limits progress in the field of healthcare AI. Generative models have recently been used to synthesize photorealistic natural images, presenting a potential solution to the data scarcity problem. But are current generative models synthesizing morphologically correct samples? In this work we present a three-dimensional generative model of the human brain that is trained at the necessary scale to generate diverse, realistic-looking, high-resolution and morphologically preserving samples and conditioned on patient characteristics (for example, age and pathology). We show that the synthetic samples generated by the model preserve biological and disease phenotypes and are realistic enough to permit use downstream in well-established image analysis tools. While the proposed model has broad future applicability, such as anomaly detection and learning under limited data, its generative capabilities can be used to directly mitigate data scarcity, limited data availability and algorithmic fairness."

The study encompasses various critical components, including dataset pre-processing techniques, the utilization of the Squeeze and Excitation Network (SE-Block), and the atrous spatial separable pyramid Block to enhance segmentation capabilities. Detailed descriptions of pre-processing procedures, such as removing the cranial bone segment, image resizing, and normalization, are provided.

The training process adopts the dice coefficient as the loss function and utilizes Adam optimization. The study evaluated the model's performance using multiple metrics, including intersection over union (IOU), Dice Score, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score, and offers a comparative analysis with other CNN architectures.

The initial clinical data of the patients with acute DQ poisoning were collected. Machine learning methods such as logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine (SVM), and gradient boosting were applied to build the prediction models. The whole sample was split into a training set and a test set at a ratio of 8:2. The performances of these models were assessed in terms of discrimination, calibration, and clinical decision curve analysis (DCA). We also used the SHAP interpretation tool to provide an intuitive explanation of the risk of death in patients with DQ poisoning. Logistic regression, random forest, SVM, and gradient boosting models were established, and the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) were 0.91, 0.98, 0.96 and 0.94, respectively. The net benefits were similar across all four models. The four machine learning models can be reliable tools for predicting death risk in patients with acute DQ poisoning.

        "abstract": "Corneal infection is a major public health concern worldwide and the most common cause of unilateral corneal blindness. Toxic effects of different microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi, worsen keratitis leading to corneal perforation even with optimal drug treatment. The cornea forms the main refractive surface of the eye. Diseases affecting the cornea can cause severe visual impairment. Therefore, it is crucial to analyze the risk of corneal perforation and visual impairment in corneal ulcer patients for making early treatment strategies. The modeling of a fully automated prognostic model system was performed in two parts. In the first part, the dataset contained 4973 slit lamp images of corneal ulcer patients in three centers. A deep learning model was developed and tested for segmenting and classifying five lesions (corneal ulcer, corneal scar, hypopyon, corneal descementocele, and corneal neovascularization) in the eyes of corneal ulcer patients. Further, hierarchical quantification was carried out based on policy rules. In the second part, the dataset included clinical data (name, gender, age, best corrected visual acuity, and type of corneal ulcer) of 240 patients with corneal ulcers and respective 1010 slit lamp images under two light sources (natural light and cobalt blue light). The slit lamp images were then quantified hierarchically according to the policy rules developed in the first part of the modeling. Combining the above clinical data, the features were used to build the final prognostic model system for corneal ulcer perforation outcome and visual impairment using machine learning algorithms such as XGBoost, LightGBM. The ROC curve area (AUC value) evaluated the model’s performance. For segmentation of the five lesions, the accuracy rates of hypopyon, descemetocele, corneal ulcer under blue light, and corneal neovascularization were 96.86, 91.64, 90.51, and 93.97, respectively. For the corneal scar lesion classification, the accuracy rate of the final model was 69.76. The XGBoost model performed the best in predicting the 1-month prognosis of patients, with an AUC of 0.81 (95% CI 0.63–1.00) for ulcer perforation and an AUC of 0.77 (95% CI 0.63–0.91) for visual impairment. In predicting the 3-month prognosis of patients, the XGBoost model received the best AUC of 0.97 (95% CI 0.92–1.00) for ulcer perforation, while the LightGBM model achieved the best performance with an AUC of 0.98 (95% CI 0.94–1.00) for visual impairment."

        "abstract": "This work was inspired by the observation that a majority of MR-electrical properties tomography studies are based on direct comparisons with ex vivo measurements carried out on post-mortem samples in the 90’s. As a result, the in vivo conductivity values obtained from MRI in the megahertz range in different types of tissues (brain, liver, tumors, muscles, etc.) found in the literature may not correspond to their ex vivo equivalent, which still serves as a reference for electromagnetic modelling. This study aims to pave the way for improving current databases since the definition of personalized electromagnetic models (e.g. for Specific Absorption Rate estimation) would benefit from better estimation. Seventeen healthy volunteers underwent MRI of both brain and thorax/abdomen using a three-dimensional ultrashort echo-time (UTE) sequence. We estimated conductivity (S/m) in several classes of macroscopic tissue using a customized reconstruction method from complex UTE images, and give general statistics for each of these regions (mean-median-standard deviation). These values are used to find possible correlations with biological parameters such as age, sex, body mass index and/or fat volume fraction, using linear regression analysis. In short, the collected in vivo values show significant deviations from the ex vivo values in conventional databases, and we show significant relationships with the latter parameters in certain organs for the first time, e.g. a decrease in brain conductivity with age."

Children with IBD often suffer significant morbidity due to physical and emotional effects of the disease and treatment. Corticosteroids, often a component of therapy, carry undesirable side effects with long term use. Steroid-free remission has become a standard for care-quality improvement. Anticipating therapeutic outcomes is difficult, with treatments often leveraged in a trial-and-error fashion. Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated success in medical imaging classification tasks. Predicting patients who will attain remission will help inform treatment decisions. The provided dataset comprises 951 tissue section scans (167 whole-slides) obtained from 18 pediatric IBD patients. Patient level structured data include IBD diagnosis, 12- and 52-week steroid use and name, and remission status. Each slide is labelled with biopsy site and normal or abnormal classification per the surgical pathology report. Each tissue section scan from an abnormal slide is further classified by an experienced pathologist. Researchers utilizing this dataset may select from the provided outcomes or add labels and annotations from their own institutions."

We hence conducted systematic review and meta-analysis comparing diagnostic accuracy of AI to Sokolow–Lyon’s and Cornell’s criteria. Our aim was to provide a comprehensive overview of the newly developed AI tools for diagnosing LVH. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases for relevant studies until May 2023. Included were observational studies evaluating AI’s accuracy in LVH detection. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) and pooled sensitivities and specificities assessed AI’s performance against standard criteria. A total of 66,479 participants, with and without LVH, were included. Use of AI was associated with improved diagnostic accuracy with summary ROC (SROC) of 0.87. Sokolow–Lyon’s and Cornell’s criteria had lower accuracy (0.68 and 0.60). AI had sensitivity and specificity of 69% and 87%. In comparison, Sokolow–Lyon’s specificity was 92% with a sensitivity of 25%, while Cornell’s specificity was 94% with a sensitivity of 19%. This indicating its superior diagnostic accuracy of AI based algorithm in LVH detection. Our study demonstrates that AI-based methods for diagnosing LVH exhibit higher diagnostic accuracy compared to conventional criteria, with notable increases in sensitivity. These findings contribute to the validation of AI as a promising tool for LVH detection."

Currently, diagnosing involves a series of current diagnostic methods that are invasive, time-consuming, and expensive. Near-infrared spectroscopy and aquaphotomics can detect changes in biofluids and thus have the potential to diagnose disease. This study aimed to investigate the diagnostic ability of near infrared spectroscopy and aquaphotomics for Inflammatory Bowel Disease and its types. This method used blood plasma and saliva samples absorbance spectrum and multivariate analysis with the Principal Component Analysis and, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, and Support Vector Machine in the range 1300–1600 nm and 12 water absorbance bands in this range, separately. In the near-infrared range, total accuracy of 100% led to the separation of the healthy group and Inflammatory Bowel Disease and then the separation of the healthy group and patients with Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn's Disease. The aquaphotomics approach was used to investigate the changes in the 12 water absorbance bands and their impact on the accuracy of the diagnostic method. Aquaphotomics also detected 100% of the mentioned samples. We achieved a fast, accurate, non-invasive method based on near-infrared spectroscopy and aquaphotomics to diagnose Inflammatory Bowel Disease and its types using blood plasma or saliva samples. The current study found that monitoring blood plasma or saliva using near-infrared spectra offers an opportunity to thoroughly investigate biofluids and changes in their water spectral patterns caused by complex physiological changes due to Inflammatory Bowel Disease and its types, and to visualize these changes using aquagram."

We aimed to train and evaluate ten machine learning (ML) classification approaches in predicting symptoms of ARIs reported by mothers among children younger than 5 years in sub-Saharan African (sSA) countries. We used the most recent (2012–2022) nationally representative Demographic and Health Surveys data of 33 sSA countries. The air pollution covariates such as global annual surface particulate matter (PM 2.5) and the nitrogen dioxide available in the form of raster images were obtained from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The MLA was used for predicting the symptoms of ARIs among under-five children. We randomly split the dataset into two, 80% was used to train the model, and the remaining 20% was used to test the trained model. Model performance was evaluated using sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. A total of 327,507 under-five children were included in the study. About 7.10, 4.19, 20.61, and 21.02% of children reported symptoms of ARI, Severe ARI, cough, and fever in the 2 weeks preceding the survey years respectively. The prevalence of ARI was highest in Mozambique (15.3%), Uganda (15.05%), Togo (14.27%), and Namibia (13.65%,), whereas Uganda (40.10%), Burundi (38.18%), Zimbabwe (36.95%), and Namibia (31.2%) had the highest prevalence of cough. The results of the random forest plot revealed that spatial locations (longitude, latitude), particulate matter, land surface temperature, nitrogen dioxide, and the number of cattle in the houses are the most important features in predicting the diagnosis of symptoms of ARIs among under-five children in sSA. The RF algorithm was selected as the best ML model (AUC = 0.77, Accuracy = 0.72) to predict the symptoms of ARIs among children under five. The MLA performed well in predicting the symptoms of ARIs and associated predictors among under-five children across the sSA countries. Random forest MLA was identified as the best classifier to be employed for the prediction of the symptoms of ARI among under-five children."

The work tackles important RPM concerns such early health issue diagnosis and accurate real-time physiological data collection and analysis using wearable IoT devices. By assessing important health factors like heart rate, blood pressure, pulse, temperature, activity level, weight management, respiration rate, medication adherence, sleep patterns, and oxygen levels, the suggested Remote Patient Monitor Model (RPMM) attains a noteworthy accuracy of 97.23%. The model's capacity to identify spatial and temporal relationships in health data is improved by novel techniques such as the use of CNN for spatial analysis and feature extraction and LSTM for temporal sequence modeling. Early intervention is made easier by this synergistic approach, which enhances trend identification and anomaly detection in vital signs. A variety of datasets are used to validate the model's robustness, highlighting its efficacy in remote patient care.

We aim to use survival-tree based machine learning models as more flexible nonparametric techniques to examine the combined effects of multiple physiological risk factors on mortality. More specifically, we (1) study the combined effects between multiple physiological factors and all-cause mortality, (2) identify the five most influential factors and visualize their combined influence on all-cause mortality, and (3) compare the mortality cut-offs with the current clinical thresholds. Data from the 1999–2014 NHANES Survey were linked to National Death Index data with follow-up through 2015 for 17,790 adults. We observed that the five most influential factors affecting mortality are the tobacco smoking biomarker cotinine, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), plasma glucose, sex, and white blood cell count. Specifically, high mortality risk is associated with being male, active smoking, low GFR, elevated plasma glucose levels, and high white blood cell count. The identified mortality-based cutoffs for these factors are mostly consistent with relevant studies and current clinical thresholds. This approach enabled us to identify important cutoffs and provide enhanced risk prediction as an important basis to inform clinical practice and develop new strategies for precision medicine."

Among the feature selection techniques, the knockoff filter procedure proposes a unique framework that minimizes false discovery rates (FDR). However, employing a deep neural network architecture for a knockoff filter framework requires higher detection power. Using the knockoff filter framework, we present a Deep neural network with PaIrwise connected layers integrated with stochastic Gates (DeepPIG) for the feature selection model. DeepPIG exhibited better detection power in synthetic data than the baseline and recent models such as Deep feature selection using Paired-Input Nonlinear Knockoffs (DeepPINK), Stochastic Gates (STG), and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) while not violating the preselected FDR level, especially when the signal of the features were weak. The selected features determined by DeepPIG demonstrated superior classification performance compared with the baseline model in real-world data analyses, including the prediction of certain cancer prognosis and classification tasks using microbiome and single-cell datasets. In conclusion, DeepPIG is a robust feature selection approach even when the signals of features are weak. Source code is available at https://github.com/DMCB-GIST/DeepPIG."

The clinical data of 647 patients with NSCLC who underwent surgical resection were collected and stratified into training (80%), validation (10%), and testing (10%) datasets. Machine learning models were trained on the training data using clinical parameters including PD-L1 expression. The top-performing model was assessed on the test data using the SHAP analysis and partial dependence plots to quantify the contribution of the PD-L1 expression. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards model was used to validate the association between PD-L1 expression and postoperative recurrence. The random forest model demonstrated the highest predictive performance with the SHAP analysis, highlighting PD-L1 expression as an important feature, and the multivariate Cox analysis indicated a significant increase in the risk of postoperative recurrence with each increment in PD-L1 expression. These findings suggest that variations in PD-L1 expression may provide valuable information for clinical decision-making regarding lung cancer treatment strategies."

There was no or weak evidence of direct effects, but the sample size of intervention recipients was small, limiting statistical power. There was the strongest evidence of spillover effects of combined chemoprevention and indoor residual spraying. Among non-recipients within 1 km of index cases, the combined intervention reduced malaria incidence by 43% (95% confidence interval, 20–59%). In analyses among non-recipients within 3 km of interventions, the combined intervention reduced infection prevalence by 79% (6–95%) and seroprevalence, which captures recent infections and has higher statistical power, by 34% (20–45%). Accounting for spillover effects increased the cost-effectiveness of the combined intervention by 42%.

Here we have created a curated dataset based on the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care database spanning 2,400 real patient cases and four common abdominal pathologies as well as a framework to simulate a realistic clinical setting. We show that current state-of-the-art LLMs do not accurately diagnose patients across all pathologies (performing significantly worse than physicians), follow neither diagnostic nor treatment guidelines, and cannot interpret laboratory results, thus posing a serious risk to the health of patients. Furthermore, we move beyond diagnostic accuracy and demonstrate that they cannot be easily integrated into existing workflows because they often fail to follow instructions and are sensitive to both the quantity and order of information. Overall, our analysis reveals that LLMs are currently not ready for autonomous clinical decision-making while providing a dataset and framework to guide future studies."

The best overall model used only clinical data (F1-score: 0.736; positive predictive value (PPV): 0.734). The imaging models employed fetal head, abdomen and femur US images, showing limited discriminative results. The best model used femur images (F1-score: 0.594; PPV: 0.580). Consequently, we constructed ensemble models to test whether US imaging could enhance the clinical data model. The best ensemble model included clinical data and US femur images (F1-score: 0.689; PPV: 0.693), presenting a false positive and false negative interesting trade-off. The model accurately predicted CS on 4 additional cases, despite misclassifying 20 additional VD, resulting in a 6.0% decrease in average accuracy compared to the clinical data model. Hence, integrating US imaging into the latter model can be a new development in assisting mode of delivery counseling."

Clinical presentation and disease course are highly heterogeneous. Typically, disease progression occurs over time and is characterized by the gradual accumulation of disability. The risk of developing MS is driven by complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors, including the gut microbiome. How the commensal gut microbiota impacts disease severity and progression over time remains unknown. In a longitudinal study, disability status and associated clinical features in 58 MS patients were tracked over 4.2 ± 0.98 years, and the baseline fecal gut microbiome was characterized via 16S amplicon sequencing. Progressor status, defined as patients with an increase in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), were correlated with features of the gut microbiome to determine candidate microbiota associated with risk of MS disease progression. We found no overt differences in microbial community diversity and overall structure between MS patients exhibiting disease progression and non-progressors. However, a total of 41 bacterial species were associated with worsening disease, including a marked depletion in Akkermansia, Lachnospiraceae, and Oscillospiraceae, with an expansion of Alloprevotella, Prevotella-9, and Rhodospirillales. Analysis of the metabolic potential of the inferred metagenome from taxa associated with progression revealed enrichment in oxidative stress-inducing aerobic respiration at the expense of microbial vitamin K2 production (linked to Akkermansia), and a depletion in SCFA metabolism (linked to Oscillospiraceae). Further, as a proof of principle, statistical modeling demonstrated that microbiota composition and clinical features were sufficient to predict disease progression. Additionally, we found that constipation, a frequent gastrointestinal comorbidity among MS patients, exhibited a divergent microbial signature compared with progressor status. These results demonstrate a proof of principle for the utility of the gut microbiome for predicting disease progression in MS in a small well-defined cohort. Further, analysis of the inferred metagenome suggested that oxidative stress, vitamin K2, and SCFAs are associated with progression, warranting future functional validation and mechanistic study."

Of the 515 patients diagnosed and treated for nmCRPC at 25 participating Japanese Urological Oncology Group centers, 450 patients with complete clinical information were included. The prognostic values of clinical factors were evaluated with respect to prostate specific antigen progression-free (PFS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), and overall survival (OS). The optimal cutoff value of PSADT was identified using survival tree analysis by Python. The Median PSA and PSADT at diagnosis of nmCRPC were 3.3 ng/ml, and 5.2 months, respectively. Patients treated with novel hormonal therapy (NHT) showed significantly longer PFS (HR: hazard ratio 0.38, p < 0.0001) and PFS2 (HR 0.45, p < 0.0001) than those treated with vintage nonsteroidal antiandrogen agent (Vintage). The survival tree identified 4.65 months as the most prognostic PSADT cutoff point. Among the clinical and pathological factors PSADT of < 4.65 months remained an independent prognostic factor for OS (HR 2.96, p = 0.0003) and CSS (HR 3.66, p < 0.0001).

The prognostic significance of MMP9 was assessed using Kaplan–Meier and Cox regression analyses. PyRadiomics was used to extract the features of H&E-stained whole slide images. Feature selection was performed using the maximum relevance and minimum redundancy (mRMR) and recursive feature elimination (RFE) algorithms. Prediction models were created using support vector machines (SVM) and logistic regression (LR). The performance was assessed using ROC analysis, calibration curve assessment, and decision curve analysis. MMP9 expression was elevated in patients with GBM. This was an independent prognostic factor for GBM. Six features were selected for the pathomics model. The area under the curves (AUCs) of the training and test subsets were 0.828 and 0.808, respectively, for the SVM model and 0.778 and 0.754, respectively, for the LR model. The C-index and calibration plots exhibited effective estimation abilities. The pathomics score calculated using the SVM model was highly correlated with overall survival time. These findings indicate that MMP9 plays a crucial role in GBM development and prognosis. Our pathomics model demonstrated high efficacy for predicting MMP9 expression levels and prognosis of patients with GBM."

The FIR filters are preferred for their higher-order performance and stability over IIR filters, especially in real-time applications. The Modified FIR (MFIR) blocks were reconstructed using the optimized adder-multiplier block for better noise reduction performance. The MIT-BIT database is used as reference where the noises are filtered by the MFIR based on Optimized Kogge Stone Adder (OKSA). Features are extracted and analyzed using Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and Cross Correlation (CC). At this modern era, Hybrid methods of Machine Learning (HMLM) methods are preferred because of their combined performance which is better than non-fused methods. The accuracy of the Hybrid Neural Network (HNN) model reached 92.3%, surpassing other models such as Generalized Sequential Neural Networks (GSNN), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machine with linear kernel (SVM linear), and Support Vector Machine with Radial Basis Function kernel (SVM RBF) by margins of 3.3%, 5.3%, 23.3%, and 24.3%, respectively. While the precision of the HNN is 91.1%, it was slightly lower than GSNN and ANN but higher than both SVM linear and SVM -RBF. The HNN with various features are incorporated to improve the ECG classification. The accuracy of the HNN is switched to 95.99% when the DWT and CC are combined. Also, it improvises other parameters such as precision 93.88%, recall is 0.94, F1 score is 0.88, Kappa is 0.89, kurtosis is 1.54, skewness is 1.52 and error rate 0.076. These parameters are higher than recently developed models whose algorithms and methods accuracy is more than 90%."

        "abstract": "Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease with intricate pathogenesis and varied presentation. Accurate diagnostic tools are imperative to detect and manage UC. This study sought to construct a robust diagnostic model using gene expression profiles and to identify key genes that differentiate UC patients from healthy controls. Gene expression profiles from eight cohorts, encompassing a total of 335 UC patients and 129 healthy controls, were analyzed. A total of 7530 gene sets were computed using the GSEA method. Subsequent batch correction, PCA plots, and intersection analysis identified crucial pathways and genes. Machine learning, incorporating 101 algorithm combinations, was employed to develop diagnostic models. Verification was done using four external cohorts, adding depth to the sample repertoire. Evaluation of immune cell infiltration was undertaken through single-sample GSEA. All statistical analyses were conducted using R (Version: 4.2.2), with significance set at a P value below 0.05. Employing the GSEA method, 7530 gene sets were computed. From this, 19 intersecting pathways were discerned to be consistently upregulated across all cohorts, which pertained to cell adhesion, development, metabolism, immune response, and protein regulation. This corresponded to 83 unique genes. Machine learning insights culminated in the LASSO regression model, which outperformed others with an average AUC of 0.942. This model's efficacy was further ratified across four external cohorts, with AUC values ranging from 0.694 to 0.873 and significant Kappa statistics indicating its predictive accuracy. The LASSO logistic regression model highlighted 13 genes, with LCN2, ASS1, and IRAK3 emerging as pivotal. Notably, LCN2 showcased significantly heightened expression in active UC patients compared to both non-active patients and healthy controls (P < 0.05). Investigations into the correlation between these genes and immune cell infiltration in UC highlighted activated dendritic cells, with statistically significant positive correlations noted for LCN2 and IRAK3 across multiple datasets. Through comprehensive gene expression analysis and machine learning, a potent LASSO-based diagnostic model for UC was developed. Genes such as LCN2, ASS1, and IRAK3 hold potential as both diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets, offering a promising direction for future UC research and clinical application."

        "abstract": "Stratified medicine holds great promise to tailor treatment to the needs of individual patients. While genetics holds great potential to aid patient stratification, it remains a major challenge to operationalize complex genetic risk factor profiles to deconstruct clinical heterogeneity. Contemporary approaches to this problem rely on polygenic risk scores (PRS), which provide only limited clinical utility and lack a clear biological foundation. To overcome these limitations, we develop the CASTom-iGEx approach to stratify individuals based on the aggregated impact of their genetic risk factor profiles on tissue specific gene expression levels. The paradigmatic application of this approach to coronary artery disease or schizophrenia patient cohorts identified diverse strata or biotypes. These biotypes are characterized by distinct endophenotype profiles as well as clinical parameters and are fundamentally distinct from PRS based groupings. In stark contrast to the latter, the CASTom-iGEx strategy discovers biologically meaningful and clinically actionable patient subgroups, where complex genetic liabilities are not randomly distributed across individuals but rather converge onto distinct disease relevant biological processes. These results support the notion of different patient biotypes characterized by partially distinct pathomechanisms. Thus, the universally applicable approach presented here has the potential to constitute an important component of future personalized medicine paradigms."

        "abstract": "Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics and tractography can be biased due to low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and systematic errors resulting from image artifacts and imperfections in magnetic field gradients. The imperfections include non-uniformity and nonlinearity, effects caused by eddy currents, and the influence of background and imaging gradients. We investigated the impact of systematic errors on DTI metrics of an isotropic phantom and DTI metrics and tractography of a rat brain measured at high resolution. We tested denoising and Gibbs ringing removal methods combined with the B matrix spatial distribution (BSD) method for magnetic field gradient calibration. The results showed that the performance of the BSD method depends on whether Gibbs ringing is removed and the effectiveness of stochastic error removal. Region of interest (ROI)-based analysis of the DTI metrics showed that, depending on the size of the ROI and its location in space, correction methods can remove systematic bias to varying degrees. The preprocessing pipeline proposed and dedicated to this type of data together with the BSD method resulted in an even − 90% decrease in fractional anisotropy (FA) (globally and locally) in the isotropic phantom and − 45% in the rat brain. The largest global changes in the rat brain tractogram compared to the standard method without preprocessing (sDTI) were noticed after denoising. The direction of the first eigenvector obtained from DTI after denoising, Gibbs ringing removal and BSD differed by an average of 56 and 10 degrees in the ROI from sDTI and from sDTI after denoising and Gibbs ringing removal, respectively. The latter can be identified with the amount of improvement in tractography due to the elimination of systematic errors related to imperfect magnetic field gradients. Based on the results, the systematic bias for high resolution data mainly depended on SNR, but the influence of non-uniform gradients could also be seen. After denoising, the BSD method was able to further correct both the metrics and tractography of the diffusion tensor in the rat brain by taking into account the actual distribution of magnetic field gradients independent of the examined object and uniquely dependent on the scanner and sequence. This means that in vivo studies are also subject to this type of errors, which should be taken into account when processing such data."

        "abstract": "Sleep is essential to life. Accurate measurement and classification of sleep/wake and sleep stages is important in clinical studies for sleep disorder diagnoses and in the interpretation of data from consumer devices for monitoring physical and mental well-being. Existing non-polysomnography sleep classification techniques mainly rely on heuristic methods developed in relatively small cohorts. Thus, we aimed to establish the accuracy of wrist-worn accelerometers for sleep stage classification and subsequently describe the association between sleep duration and efficiency (proportion of total time asleep when in bed) with mortality outcomes. We developed a self-supervised deep neural network for sleep stage classification using concurrent laboratory-based polysomnography and accelerometry. After exclusion, 1113 participant nights of data were used for training. The difference between polysomnography and the model classifications on the external validation was 48.2 min (95% limits of agreement (LoA): −50.3 to 146.8 min) for total sleep duration, −17.1 min for REM duration (95% LoA: −56.7 to 91.0 min) and 31.1 min (95% LoA: −67.3 to 129.5 min) for NREM duration. The sleep classifier was deployed in the UK Biobank with ~100,000 participants to study the association of sleep duration and sleep efficiency with all-cause mortality. Among 66,262 UK Biobank participants, 1644 mortality events were observed. Short sleepers (<6 h) had a higher risk of mortality compared to participants with normal sleep duration 6–7.9 h, regardless of whether they had low sleep efficiency (Hazard ratios (HRs): 1.36; 95% confidence intervals (CIs): 1.18 to 1.58) or high sleep efficiency (HRs: 1.29; 95% CIs: 1.04–1.61). Deep-learning-based sleep classification using accelerometers has a fair to moderate agreement with polysomnography. Our findings suggest that having short overnight sleep confers mortality risk irrespective of sleep continuity."

Although molecular and antigen tests now exist for COVID-19, in resource-limited settings, screening tests are often not available. Furthermore, during the early stages of the pandemic tests were not available in any capacity. We utilized an automated machine learning (ML) approach to train and evaluate thousands of models on a clinical dataset consisting of commonly available clinical and laboratory data, along with cytokine profiles for patients (n = 150). These models were then further tested for generalizability on an out-of-sample secondary dataset (n = 120). We were able to develop a ML model for rapid and reliable screening of patients as COVID-19 positive or negative using three approaches: commonly available clinical and laboratory data, a cytokine profile, and a combination of the common data and cytokine profile. Of the tens of thousands of models automatically tested for the three approaches, all three approaches demonstrated > 92% sensitivity and > 88 specificity while our highest performing model achieved 95.6% sensitivity and 98.1% specificity. These models represent a potential effective deployable solution for COVID-19 status classification for symptomatic patients in resource-limited settings and provide proof-of-concept for rapid development of screening tools for novel emerging infectious diseases."

To improve reproducibility, the International Immuno-oncology Working Group recently released recommendations for the computational assessment of TILs that build on visual scoring guidelines. However, existing resources do not adequately address these recommendations due to the lack of annotation datasets that enable joint, panoptic segmentation of tissue regions and cells. Moreover, existing deep-learning methods focus entirely on either tissue segmentation or cell nuclei detection, which complicates the process of TILs assessment by necessitating the use of multiple models and reconciling inconsistent predictions. We introduce PanopTILs, a region and cell-level annotation dataset containing 814,886 nuclei from 151 patients, openly accessible at: sites.google.com/view/panoptils. Using PanopTILs we developed MuTILs, a neural network optimized for assessing TILs in accordance with clinical recommendations. MuTILs is a concept bottleneck model designed to be interpretable and to encourage sensible predictions at multiple resolutions. Using a rigorous internal-external cross-validation procedure, MuTILs achieves an AUROC of 0.93 for lymphocyte detection and a DICE coefficient of 0.81 for tumor-associated stroma segmentation. Our computational score closely matched visual scores from 2 pathologists (Spearman R = 0.58–0.61, p < 0.001). Moreover, computational TILs scores had a higher prognostic value than visual scores, independent of TNM stage and patient age. In conclusion, we introduce a comprehensive open data resource and a modeling approach for detailed mapping of the breast tumor microenvironment."

        "abstract": "Metastasis occurs frequently after resection of pancreatic cancer (PaC). In this study, we hypothesized that multi-parametric analysis of pre-metastatic liver biopsies would classify patients according to their metastatic risk, timing and organ site. Liver biopsies obtained during pancreatectomy from 49 patients with localized PaC and 19 control patients with non-cancerous pancreatic lesions were analyzed, combining metabolomic, tissue and single-cell transcriptomics and multiplex imaging approaches. Patients were followed prospectively (median 3 years) and classified into four recurrence groups; early (<6 months after resection) or late (>6 months after resection) liver metastasis (LiM); extrahepatic metastasis (EHM); and disease-free survivors (no evidence of disease (NED)). Overall, PaC livers exhibited signs of augmented inflammation compared to controls. Enrichment of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), Ki-67 upregulation and decreased liver creatine significantly distinguished those with future metastasis from NED. Patients with future LiM were characterized by scant T cell lobular infiltration, less steatosis and higher levels of citrullinated H3 compared to patients who developed EHM, who had overexpression of interferon target genes (MX1 and NR1D1) and an increase of CD11B+ natural killer (NK) cells. Upregulation of sortilin-1 and prominent NETs, together with the lack of T cells and a reduction in CD11B+ NK cells, differentiated patients with early-onset LiM from those with late-onset LiM. Liver profiles of NED closely resembled those of controls. Using the above parameters, a machine-learning-based model was developed that successfully predicted the metastatic outcome at the time of surgery with 78% accuracy. Therefore, multi-parametric profiling of liver biopsies at the time of PaC diagnosis may determine metastatic risk and organotropism and guide clinical stratification for optimal treatment selection."

Participants were categorized into the age groups of 6–7, 8–9, and 10–12, after which comparisons were performed between each age group for ASL analysis of cerebral blood flow (CBF). In total, the ADHD group exhibited significantly lower CBF in the left superior temporal gyrus and right middle frontal gyrus regions than the control group. Further analysis revealed: (1) The comparison between the ADHD group (N = 70) aged 6–7 and the age-matched control group (N = 33) showed no statistically significant difference between. (2) However, compared with the control group aged 8–9 (N = 39), the ADHD group of the same age (N = 53) showed significantly lower CBF in the left postcentral gyrus and left middle frontal gyrus regions. (3) Further, the ADHD group aged 10–12 (N = 34) demonstrated significantly lower CBF in the left superior occipital region than the age-matched control group (N = 37).

In this study, we present a novel machine learning approach utilizing radiomics features from multiple organ volumes of interest (VOIs) to predict TACE outcomes for 252 HCC patients. Unlike conventional radiomics models requiring laborious manual segmentation limited to tumoral regions, our approach captures information comprehensively across various VOIs using a fully automated, pretrained deep learning model applied to pre-TACE CT images. Evaluation of radiomics random survival forest models against clinical ones using Cox proportional hazard demonstrated comparable performance in predicting overall survival. However, radiomics outperformed clinical models in predicting progression-free survival. Explainable analysis highlighted the significance of non-tumoral VOI features, with their cumulative importance superior to features from the largest liver tumor. The proposed approach overcomes the limitations of manual VOI segmentation, requires no radiologist input and highlight the clinical relevance of features beyond tumor regions. Our findings suggest the potential of this radiomics models in predicting TACE outcomes, with possible implications for other clinical scenarios."

        "abstract": "The study of muscle mass as an imaging-derived phenotype (IDP) may yield new insights into determining the normal and pathologic variations in muscle mass in the population. This can be done by determining 3D abdominal muscle mass from 12 distinct abdominal muscle regions and groups using computed tomography (CT) in a racially diverse medical biobank. To develop a fully automatic technique for assessment of CT abdominal muscle IDPs and preliminarily determine abdominal muscle IDP variations with age and sex in a clinically and racially diverse medical biobank. This retrospective study was conducted using the Penn Medicine BioBank (PMBB), a research protocol that recruits adult participants during outpatient visits at hospitals in the Penn Medicine network. We developed a deep residual U-Net (ResUNet) to segment 12 abdominal muscle groups including the left and right psoas, quadratus lumborum, erector spinae, gluteus medius, rectus abdominis, and lateral abdominals. 110 CT studies were randomly selected for training, validation, and testing. 44 of the 110 CT studies were selected to enrich the dataset with representative cases of intra-abdominal and abdominal wall pathology. The studies were divided into non-overlapping training, validation and testing sets. Model performance was evaluated using the Sørensen–Dice coefficient. Volumes of individual muscle groups were plotted to distribution curves. To investigate associations between muscle IDPs, age, and sex, deep learning model segmentations were performed on a larger abdominal CT dataset from PMBB consisting of 295 studies. Multivariable models were used to determine relationships between muscle mass, age and sex. The model's performance (Dice scores) on the test data was the following: psoas: 0.85 ± 0.12, quadratus lumborum: 0.72 ± 0.14, erector spinae: 0.92 ± 0.07, gluteus medius: 0.90 ± 0.08, rectus abdominis: 0.85 ± 0.08, lateral abdominals: 0.85 ± 0.09. The average Dice score across all muscle groups was 0.86 ± 0.11. Average total muscle mass for females was 2041 ± 560.7 g with a high of 2256 ± 560.1 g (41–50 year old cohort) and a change of − 0.96 g/year, declining to an average mass of 1579 ± 408.8 g (81–100 year old cohort). Average total muscle mass for males was 3086 ± 769.1 g with a high of 3385 ± 819.3 g (51–60 year old cohort) and a change of − 1.73 g/year, declining to an average mass of 2629 ± 536.7 g (81–100 year old cohort). Quadratus lumborum was most highly correlated with age for both sexes (correlation coefficient of − 0.5). Gluteus medius mass in females was positively correlated with age with a coefficient of 0.22. These preliminary findings show that our CNN can automate detailed abdominal muscle volume measurement. Unlike prior efforts, this technique provides 3D muscle segmentations of individual muscles. This technique will dramatically impact sarcopenia diagnosis and research, elucidating its clinical and public health implications. Our results suggest a peak age range for muscle mass and an expected rate of decline, both of which vary between genders. Future goals are to investigate genetic variants for sarcopenia and malnutrition, while describing genotype–phenotype associations of muscle mass in healthy humans using imaging-derived phenotypes. It is feasible to obtain 3D abdominal muscle IDPs with high accuracy from patients in a medical biobank using fully automated machine learning methods. Abdominal muscle IDPs showed significant variations in lean mass by age and sex. In the future, this tool can be leveraged to perform a genome-wide association study across the medical biobank and determine genetic variants associated with early or accelerated muscle wasting."

The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed these objective gait features had high discriminative value in distinguishing both PD subtypes from the HC with the area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.7~0.9 (p < 0.01). (2) Subtle but measurable gait differences existed between TD and PIGD patients before the onset of clinically apparent gait impairment. (3) Specific gait parameters were significantly associated with disease severity in TD and PIGD subtypes. Objective gait biomarkers based on wearable sensors may facilitate timely and personalized gait treatments in PD subtypes through early diagnosis, subtype differentiation, and disease severity monitoring."

Several lipid-related genetic risk factors for Parkinson’s disease have been identified, and the serum lipid signature of Parkinson’s disease patients is significantly distinguishable from controls. However, the extent to which lipid profiles are associated with clinical outcomes remains unclear. Untargeted high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry identified >900 serum lipids in Parkinson’s disease subjects at baseline (n = 122), and the potential for machine learning models using these lipids to predict motor and non-motor clinical scores after 2 years (n = 67) was assessed. Machine learning models performed best when baseline serum lipids were used to predict the 2-year future Unified Parkinson’s disease rating scale part three (UPDRS III) and Geriatric Depression Scale scores (both normalised root mean square error = 0.7). Feature analysis of machine learning models indicated that species of lysophosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, platelet-activating factor, sphingomyelin, diacylglycerol and triacylglycerol were top predictors of both motor and non-motor scores. Serum lipids were overall more important predictors of clinical outcomes than subject sex, age and mutation status of the Parkinson’s disease risk gene LRRK2. Furthermore, lipids were found to better predict clinical scales than a panel of 27 serum cytokines previously measured in this cohort (The Michael J. Fox Foundation LRRK2 Clinical Cohort Consortium). These results suggest that lipid changes may be associated with clinical phenotypes in Parkinson’s disease."

Impaired insulin secretion from pancreatic beta-cells is a hallmark of T2D, but the mechanisms behind this defect are insufficiently characterized. Integrating multiple layers of biomedical information, such as different Omics, may allow more accurate understanding of complex diseases such as T2D. Our aim was to explore and use Machine Learning to integrate multiple sources of biological/molecular information (multiOmics), in our case RNA-sequening, DNA methylation, SNP and phenotypic data from islet donors with T2D and non-diabetic controls. We exploited Machine Learning to perform multiOmics integration of DNA methylation, expression, SNPs, and phenotypes from pancreatic islets of 110 individuals, with ~ 30% being T2D cases. DNA methylation was analyzed using Infinium MethylationEPIC array, expression was analyzed using RNA-sequencing, and SNPs were analyzed using HumanOmniExpress arrays. Supervised linear multiOmics integration via DIABLO based on Partial Least Squares (PLS) achieved an accuracy of 91 ± 15% of T2D prediction with an area under the curve of 0.96 ± 0.08 on the test dataset after cross-validation. Biomarkers identified by this multiOmics integration, including SACS and TXNIP DNA methylation, OPRD1 and RHOT1 expression and a SNP annotated to ANO1, provide novel insights into the interplay between different biological mechanisms contributing to T2D. This Machine Learning approach of multiOmics cross-sectional data from human pancreatic islets achieved a promising accuracy of T2D prediction, which may potentially find broad applications in clinical diagnostics. In addition, it delivered novel candidate biomarkers for T2D and links between them across the different Omics."

Average 1-, 3-, and 5-year WBGT values prior to the survey year were calculated and analyzed using a geospatial artificial intelligence-based ensemble mixed spatial model, covering the period from 2010 to 2020. A total of 114,483 participants from the TWB were included in this study, of whom 35.9% were male and 1053 had impaired kidney function (defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2). Multivariable analysis revealed that in the male participants, during the midday period, the 1-, 3-, and 5-year average WBGT values per 1 ℃ increase were significantly positively associated with eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 (odds ratio [OR], 1.096, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.002–1.199, p = 0.044 for 1 year; OR, 1.093, 95% CI = 1.000–1.196, p = 0.005 for 3 years; OR, 1.094, 95% CI = 1.002–1.195, p = 0.045 for 5 years). However, significant associations were not found for the working hours period. In the female participants, during the midday period, the 1-, 3-, and 5-year average WBGT values per 1 ℃ increase were significantly negatively associated with eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 (OR, 0.872, 95% CI = 0.778–0.976, p = 0.018 for 1 year; OR, 0.874, 95% CI = 0.780–0.978, p = 0.019 for 3 years; OR, 0.875, 95% CI = 0.784–0.977, p = 0.018 for 5 years). In addition, during the working hours period, the 1-, 3-, and 5-year average WBGT values per 1 ℃ increase were also significantly negatively associated with eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 (OR, 0.856, 95% CI = 0.774–0.946, p = 0.002 for 1 year; OR, 0.856, 95% CI = 0.774–0.948, p = 0.003 for 3 years; OR, 0.853, 95% CI = 0.772–0.943, p = 0.002 for 5 years). In conclusion, our results revealed that increased WBGT was associated with impaired kidney function in males, whereas increased WBGT was associated with a protective effect against impaired kidney function in females. Further studies are needed to elucidate the exact mechanisms underlying these sex-specific differences."

        "abstract": "Short-term mortality risk, which is indicative of individual frailty, serves as a marker for aging. Previous age clocks focused on predicting either chronological age or longer-term mortality. Aging clocks predicting short-term mortality are lacking and their algorithmic fairness remains unexamined. We developed a deep learning model to predict 1-year mortality using nationwide longitudinal data from the Finnish population (FinRegistry; n = 5.4 million), incorporating more than 8,000 features spanning up to 50 years. We achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.944, outperforming a baseline model that included only age and sex (AUC = 0.897). The model generalized well to different causes of death (AUC > 0.800 for 45 of 50 causes), including coronavirus disease 2019, which was absent in the training data. Performance varied among demographics, with young females exhibiting the best and older males the worst results. Extensive prediction fairness analyses highlighted disparities among disadvantaged groups, posing challenges to equitable integration into public health interventions. Our model accurately identified short-term mortality risk, potentially serving as a population-wide aging marker."

        "abstract": "Neuromuscular control of bionic arms has constantly improved over the past years, however, restoration of sensation remains elusive. Previous approaches to reestablish sensory feedback include tactile, electrical, and peripheral nerve stimulation, however, they cannot recreate natural, intuitive sensations. Here, we establish an experimental biological sensorimotor interface and demonstrate its potential use in neuroprosthetics. We transfer a mixed nerve to a skeletal muscle combined with glabrous dermal skin transplantation, thus forming a bi-directional communication unit in a rat model. Morphological analyses indicate reinnervation of the skin, mechanoreceptors, NMJs, and muscle spindles. Furthermore, sequential retrograde labeling reveals specific sensory reinnervation at the level of the dorsal root ganglia. Electrophysiological recordings show reproducible afferent signals upon tactile stimulation and tendon manipulation. The results demonstrate the possibility of surgically creating an interface for both decoding efferent motor control, as well as encoding afferent tactile and proprioceptive feedback, and may indicate the way forward regarding clinical translation of biological communication pathways for neuroprosthetic applications."

        "abstract": "Microbially derived short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in the human gut are tightly coupled to host metabolism, immune regulation and integrity of the intestinal epithelium. However, the production of SCFAs can vary widely between individuals consuming the same diet, with lower levels often associated with disease. A systems-scale mechanistic understanding of this heterogeneity is lacking. Here we use a microbial community-scale metabolic modelling (MCMM) approach to predict individual-specific SCFA production profiles to assess the impact of different dietary, prebiotic and probiotic inputs. We evaluate the quantitative accuracy of our MCMMs using in vitro and ex vivo data, plus published human cohort data. We find that MCMM SCFA predictions are significantly associated with blood-derived clinical chemistries, including cardiometabolic and immunological health markers, across a large human cohort. Finally, we demonstrate how MCMMs can be leveraged to design personalized dietary, prebiotic and probiotic interventions aimed at optimizing SCFA production in the gut. Our model represents an approach to direct gut microbiome engineering for precision health and nutrition."

The nephrotoxicity and developmental toxicity of azole drugs have not been systematically analyzed in the real world. We used the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) to investigate the adverse events (AEs) associated with imidazole therapy for VVC. FAERS data (from quarter 1 2004 to quarter 3 2022) were retrieved using OpenVigil 2.1, and AEs were retrieved and standardized according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). In the top 10 System Organ Class (SOC), all four drugs have been found to have kidney and urinary system diseases and pregnancy. We found significant signals, including clotrimazole [bladder transitional cell carcinoma, (report odds ratio, ROR = 291.66)], [fetal death, (ROR = 10.28)], ketoconazole[nephrogenic anemia (ROR = 22.1)], [premature rupture of membranes (ROR = 22.91 46.45, 11, 3)], Miconazole[hematuria (ROR = 19.03)], [neonatal sepsis (ROR = 123.71)], [spontaneous abortion (ROR = 5.98)], Econazole [acute kidney injury (ROR = 4.41)], [spontaneous abortion (ROR = 19.62)]. We also discovered new adverse reactions that were not reported. Therefore, when using imidazole drugs for treatment, it is necessary to closely monitor the patient's renal function, pay attention to the developmental toxicity of the fetus during pregnancy, and be aware of potential adverse reactions that may occur."

        "abstract": "Aim of the study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance and feasibility of transabdominal ultrasound shear wave elastography (SWE) in assessing sonoelastographic features of the uterus. Twenty-seven premenopausal women were enrolled between 2021 and 2022. Transabdominal SWE measured myometrial stiffness in various uterine segments. Additionally, tissue stiffness of the quadriceps femoris muscle and autochthonous back muscle was measured. Statistical analysis employed non-parametric tests, t test, and a robust mixed linear model. Stiffness values of the uterus and the two investigated muscle types exhibited a similar spectrum: 6.38 ± 2.59 kPa (median 5.61 kPa; range 2.76–11.31 kPa) for the uterine myometrium, 7.22 ± 1.24 kPa (6.82 kPa; 5.11–9.39 kPa) for the quadriceps femoris musle, and 7.43 ± 2.73 kPa (7.41 kPa; 3.10–13.73 kPa) for the autochthonous back muscle. A tendency for significant differences in myometrial stiffness was observed concerning the type of labor mode (mean stiffness of 9.17 ± 1.35 kPa after vaginal birth vs. 3.83 ± 1.35 kPa after Caesarian section, p = 0.01). No significant differences in myometrial stiffness were observed concerning age, BMI, previous pregnancies, uterine flexion and menstrual cycle phase. Transabdominal SWE of uterine stiffness seems to be a fast and practicable method in a clinical setting. Uterine stiffness appears to be largely independent of various factors, except for the mode of delivery. However, further studies are needed to validate these results."

Deploying such models requires flexible edge computing, which Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) formats enable by optimizing inference directly on wearable edge devices. This work demonstrates an innovative approach to point-of-care machine learning model pipelines by combining this capacity with an advanced self-optimizing training scheme to classify periods of Normal Sinus Rhythm (NSR), Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB), and Atrial Flutter (AFL). 742 h of electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings were pre-processed into 30-second normalized samples where variable mode decomposition purged muscle artifacts and instrumentation noise. Seventeen heart rate variability and morphological ECG features were extracted by convoluting peak detection with Gaussian distributions and delineating QRS complexes using discrete wavelet transforms. The decision tree classifier’s features, parameters, and hyperparameters were self-optimized through stratified triple nested cross-validation ranked on F1-scoring against cardiologist labeling. The selected model achieved a macro F1-score of 0.899 with 0.993 for NSR, 0.938 for AFIB, and 0.767 for AFL. The most important features included median P-wave amplitudes, PRR20, and mean heart rates. The ONNX-translated pipeline took 9.2 s/sample. This combination of our self-optimizing scheme and deployment use case of ONNX demonstrated overall accurate operational tachycardia detection."

Elastic Net Regression was used to derive the risk prediction models. Potential risk factors were considered, which included demographic characteristics, clinical symptoms, comorbidities, laboratory results, treatment process, prognosis. A total of 1906 inpatients were included finally by inclusion/exclusion criteria and were divided into derivation and test cohorts in a ratio of 8:2, where 1526 (80%) samples were used to develop prediction models under a repeated cross-validation framework and the remaining 380 (20%) samples were used for performance evaluation. Overall performance, discrimination and calibration were evaluated in the validation set and test cohort and quantified by accuracy, scaled Brier score (SbrS), the area under the ROC curve (AUROC), and Spiegelhalter-Z statistics. The models performed well, with high levels of discrimination (AUROCICU [95%CI]: 0.858 [0.803,0.899]; AUROCdeath [95%CI]: 0.906 [0.850,0.948]); and good calibrations (Spiegelhalter-ZICU: − 0.821 (p-value: 0.412); Spiegelhalter-Zdeath: 0.173) in the test set.

        "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) models are vulnerable to information leakage of their training data, which can be highly sensitive, for example, in medical imaging. Privacy-enhancing technologies, such as differential privacy (DP), aim to circumvent these susceptibilities. DP is the strongest possible protection for training models while bounding the risks of inferring the inclusion of training samples or reconstructing the original data. DP achieves this by setting a quantifiable privacy budget. Although a lower budget decreases the risk of information leakage, it typically also reduces the performance of such models. This imposes a trade-off between robust performance and stringent privacy. Additionally, the interpretation of a privacy budget remains abstract and challenging to contextualize. Here we contrast the performance of artificial intelligence models at various privacy budgets against both theoretical risk bounds and empirical success of reconstruction attacks. We show that using very large privacy budgets can render reconstruction attacks impossible, while drops in performance are negligible. We thus conclude that not using DP at all is negligent when applying artificial intelligence models to sensitive data. We deem our results to lay a foundation for further debates on striking a balance between privacy risks and model performance."

The present study proposed an AI model that would accurately predict DDL using a small number of bedside pictures of the patient’s face and neck taken simply with a smartphone. In this prospective single-center study, adult patients scheduled for endotracheal intubation under general anesthesia were included. Patient pictures were obtained in frontal, lateral, frontal-neck extension, and open mouth views. DDL prediction was performed using a deep learning model based on the EfficientNet-B5 architecture, incorporating picture view information through multitask learning. We collected 18,163 pictures from 3053 patients. After under-sampling to achieve a 1:1 image ratio of DDL to non-DDL, the model was trained and validated with a dataset of 6616 pictures from 1283 patients. The deep learning model achieved a receiver operating characteristic area under the curve of 0.81–0.88 and an F1-score of 0.72–0.81 for DDL prediction. Including picture view information improved the model’s performance. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping revealed that neck and chin characteristics in frontal and lateral views are important factors in DDL prediction. The deep learning model we developed effectively predicts DDL and requires only a small set of patient pictures taken with a smartphone. The method is practical and easy to implement."

        "abstract": "Hearing problems are commonly diagnosed with the use of tonal audiometry, which measures a patient’s hearing threshold in both air and bone conduction at various frequencies. Results of audiometry tests, usually represented graphically in the form of an audiogram, need to be interpreted by a professional audiologist in order to determine the exact type of hearing loss and administer proper treatment. However, the small number of professionals in the field can severely delay proper diagnosis. The presented work proposes a neural network solution for classification of tonal audiometry data. The solution, based on the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory architecture, has been devised and evaluated for classifying audiometry results into four classes, representing normal hearing, conductive hearing loss, mixed hearing loss, and sensorineural hearing loss. The network was trained using 15,046 test results analysed and categorised by professional audiologists. The proposed model achieves 99.33% classification accuracy on datasets outside of training. In clinical application, the model allows general practitioners to independently classify tonal audiometry results for patient referral. In addition, the proposed solution provides audiologists and otolaryngologists with access to an AI decision support system that has the potential to reduce their burden, improve diagnostic accuracy, and minimise human error."

Digital twin (DT) technology enables virtual clinical trial arm construction using historical data, circumventing these obstacles. We evaluated the feasibility of constructing a DT trial arm using a large database of real-world clinical trial data and performed an efficacy assessment of a standard-of-care (SOC) drug to examine agreement with literature data. We constructed a flGvHD DT cohort (cGvHD patients at first-line treatment) (2042 patients; 32 cohorts) using the Trial Accelerator™ Digital Twin platform and derived an SOC arm from this cohort (flGvHD DT SOC cohort) (438 patients; eight cohorts); we analyzed the efficacy of SOC (prednisone) (overall response rate (ORR)) at six months. Our analysis results are in agreement with literature: flGvHD DT: disease onset time: 7.58 months post-allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation; most used graft source: peripheral blood stem cells; flGvHD DT SOC: ORR at six months for prednisone: 52.7%. It is feasible to construct a DT cohort using existing clinical trial data; a DT SOC arm can potentially replace a control arm in clinical trials."

We measure telomere attrition and de novo elongation with up to 30 bp resolution in genetically defined populations of human cells, in blood cells from healthy donors and in blood cells from patients with genetic defects in telomere maintenance. We find that human aging is accompanied by a progressive loss of long telomeres and an accumulation of shorter telomeres. In patients with defects in telomere maintenance, the accumulation of short telomeres is more pronounced and correlates with phenotypic severity. We apply machine learning to train a binary classification model that distinguishes healthy individuals from those with telomere biology disorders. This sequencing and bioinformatic pipeline will advance our understanding of telomere maintenance mechanisms and the use of telomere length as a clinical biomarker of aging and disease."

Whilst flow cytometric MRD (Flow-MRD) can be applied to high-risk AML/ myelodysplasia patients, its diagnostic performance for detecting impending relapse is unknown. We evaluated this in a cohort comprising 136 true positives (bone marrows preceding relapse by a median of 2.45 months) and 155 true negatives (bone marrows during sustained remission). At an optimal Flow-MRD threshold of 0.040%, clinical sensitivity and specificity for relapse was 74% and 87% respectively (51% and 98% for Flow-MRD ≥ 0.1%) by ‘different-from-normal’ analysis. Median relapse kinetics were 0.78 log10/month but significantly higher at 0.92 log10/month for FLT3-mutated AML. Computational (unsupervised) Flow-MRD (C-Flow-MRD) generated optimal MRD thresholds of 0.036% and 0.082% with equivalent clinical sensitivity to standard analysis. C-Flow-MRD-identified aberrancies in HLADRlow or CD34+CD38low (LSC-type) subpopulations contributed the greatest clinical accuracy (56% sensitivity, 90% specificity) and notably, by longitudinal profiling expanded rapidly within blasts in > 40% of 86 paired MRD and relapse samples.

We attempted to utilize machine learning (ML) using basic pre-labor clinical data and laboratory measurements to predict postpartum Hemoglobin (Hb) in non-complicated singleton pregnancies. The local databases of two academic care centers on patient delivery were incorporated into the current study. Patients with preexisting coagulopathy, traumatic cases, and allogenic blood transfusion were excluded from all analyses. The association of pre-delivery variables with 24-h post-delivery hemoglobin level was evaluated using feature selection with Elastic Net regression and Random Forest algorithms. A suite of ML algorithms was employed to predict post-delivery Hb levels. Out of 2051 pregnant women, 1974 were included in the final analysis. After data pre-processing and redundant variable removal, the top predictors selected via feature selection for predicting post-delivery Hb were parity (B: 0.09 [0.05–0.12]), gestational age, pre-delivery hemoglobin (B:0.83 [0.80–0.85]) and fibrinogen levels (B:0.01 [0.01–0.01]), and pre-labor platelet count (B*1000: 0.77 [0.30–1.23]). Among the trained algorithms, artificial neural network provided the most accurate model (Root mean squared error: 0.62), which was subsequently deployed as a web-based calculator: https://predictivecalculators.shinyapps.io/ANN-HB. The current study shows that ML models could be utilized as accurate predictors of indirect measures of PPH and can be readily incorporated into healthcare systems.

        "abstract": "Sporadic venous malformations are genetic conditions primarily caused by somatic gain-of-function mutation of PIK3CA or TEK, an endothelial transmembrane receptor signaling through PIK3CA. Venous malformations are associated with pain, bleedings, thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, esthetic deformities and, in severe cases, life-threatening situations. No authorized medical treatment exists for patients with venous malformations. Here, we created a genetic mouse model of PIK3CA-related capillary venous malformations that replicates patient phenotypes. We showed that these malformations only partially signal through AKT proteins. We compared the efficacy of different drugs, including rapamycin, a mTORC1 inhibitor, miransertib, an AKT inhibitor and alpelisib, a PI3Kα inhibitor at improving the lesions seen in the mouse model. We demonstrated the effectiveness of alpelisib in preventing vascular malformations’ occurrence, improving the already established ones, and prolonging survival. Considering these findings, we were authorized to treat 25 patients with alpelisib, including 7 children displaying PIK3CA (n = 16) or TEK (n = 9)-related capillary venous malformations resistant to usual therapies including sirolimus, debulking surgical procedures or percutaneous sclerotherapies. We assessed the volume of vascular malformations using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for each patient. Alpelisib demonstrated improvement in all 25 patients. Vascular malformations previously considered intractable were reduced and clinical symptoms were attenuated. MRI showed a decrease of 33.4% and 27.8% in the median volume of PIK3CA and TEK malformations respectively, over 6 months on alpelisib. In conclusion, this study supports PI3Kα inhibition as a promising therapeutic strategy in patients with PIK3CA or TEK-related capillary venous malformations."

        "abstract": "The evidence about the associations of leukocyte telomere length (LTL) and intermediary cardiovascular phenotypes with adverse cardiovascular outcomes is inconclusive. This study assessed these relationships with cardiovascular imaging, electrocardiography, and the risks of sudden cardiac death (SCD), coronary events, and heart failure (HF) admission. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of UK Biobank participants enrolled between 2006 and 2010. LTL was measured using quantitative polymerase chain reactions. Electronic health records were used to determine the incidence of SCD, coronary events, and HF admission. Cardiovascular measurements were made using cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging and machine learning. The associations of LTL with SCD, coronary events, and HF admission and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, electrocardiogram parameters of 33,043 and 19,554 participants were evaluated by multivariate regression. The median (interquartile range) follow-up period was 11.9 (11.2–12.6) years. Data was analyzed from January to May 2023. Among the 403,382 white participants without coronary artery disease or HF, 181,637 (45.0%) were male with a mean age of 57.1 years old. LTL was independently negatively associated with a risk of SCD (LTL third quartile vs first quartile: hazard ratio [HR]: 0.81, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.72–0.92), coronary events (LTL third quartile vs first quartile: HR: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.84–0.92), and HF admission (LTL fourth quartile vs first quartile: HR: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.74–0.95). LTL was also independently positively associated with cardiac remodeling, specifically left ventricular mass index, left-ventricular-end systolic and diastolic volumes, mean left ventricular myocardial wall thickness, left ventricular stroke volume, and with electrocardiogram changes along the negative degree of T-axis. Cross-sectional study results showed that LTL was positively associated with heart size and cardiac function in middle age, but electrocardiography results did not show these associations, which could explain the negative association between LTL and risk of SCD, coronary events, and HF admission in UK Biobank participants."

        "abstract": "Models of healthy aging are typically based on the United States and Europe and may not apply to diverse and heterogeneous populations. In this study, our objectives were to conduct a meta-analysis to assess risk factors of cognition and functional ability across aging populations in Latin America and a scoping review focusing on methodological procedures. Our study design included randomized controlled trials and cohort, case–control and cross-sectional studies using multiple databases, including MEDLINE, the Virtual Health Library and Web of Science. From an initial pool of 455 studies, our meta-analysis included 38 final studies (28 assessing cognition and 10 assessing functional ability, n = 146,000 participants). Our results revealed significant but heterogeneous effects for cognition (odds ratio (OR) = 1.20, P = 0.03, confidence interval (CI) = (1.0127, 1.42); heterogeneity: I2 = 92.1%, CI = (89.8%, 94%)) and functional ability (OR = 1.20, P = 0.01, CI = (1.04, 1.39); I2 = 93.1%, CI = (89.3%, 95.5%)). Specific risk factors had limited effects, especially on functional ability, with moderate impacts for demographics and mental health and marginal effects for health status and social determinants of health. Methodological issues, such as outliers, inter-country differences and publication bias, influenced the results. Overall, we highlight the specific profile of risk factors associated with healthy aging in Latin America. The heterogeneity in results and methodological approaches in studying healthy aging call for greater harmonization and further regional research to understand healthy aging in Latin America."

        "abstract": "Digital health technologies (DHTs) are increasingly being adopted in clinical trials, as they enable objective evaluations of health parameters in free-living environments. Although lumbar accelerometers notably provide reliable gait parameters, embedding accelerometers in chest devices, already used for vital signs monitoring, could capture a more comprehensive picture of participants’ wellbeing, while reducing the burden of multiple devices. Here we assess the validity of gait parameters measured from a chest accelerometer. Twenty healthy adults (13 females, mean ± sd age: 33.9 ± 9.1 years) instrumented with lumbar and chest accelerometers underwent in-lab and outside-lab walking tasks, while monitored with reference devices (an instrumented mat, and a 6-accelerometers set). Gait parameters were extracted from chest and lumbar accelerometers using our open-source Scikit Digital Health gait (SKDH-gait) algorithm, and compared against reference values via Bland–Altman plots, Pearson’s correlation, and intraclass correlation coefficient. Mixed effects regression models were performed to investigate the effect of device, task, and their interaction. Gait parameters derived from chest and lumbar accelerometers showed no significant difference and excellent agreement across all tasks, as well as good-to-excellent agreement and strong correlation against reference values, thus supporting the deployment of a single multimodal chest device in clinical trials, to simultaneously measure gait and vital signs."

        "abstract": "Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a prevalent neurological condition characterized by motor and cognitive impairments, typically manifesting around the age of 50 and presenting symptoms such as gait difficulties and speech impairments. Although a cure remains elusive, symptom management through medication is possible. Timely detection is pivotal for effective disease management. In this study, we leverage Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques, specifically K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Feed-forward Neural Network (FNN) models, to differentiate between individuals with PD and healthy individuals based on voice signal characteristics. Our dataset, sourced from the University of California at Irvine (UCI), comprises 195 voice recordings collected from 31 patients. To optimize model performance, we employ various strategies including Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) for addressing class imbalance, Feature Selection to identify the most relevant features, and hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV. Our experimentation reveals that the FNN and KSVM models, trained on an 80–20 split of the dataset for training and testing respectively, yield the most promising results. The FNN model achieves an impressive overall accuracy of 99.11%, with 98.78% recall, 99.96% precision, and a 99.23% f1-score. Similarly, the KSVM model demonstrates strong performance with an overall accuracy of 95.89%, recall of 96.88%, precision of 98.71%, and an f1-score of 97.62%. Overall, our study showcases the efficacy of ML and DL techniques in accurately identifying PD from voice signals, underscoring the potential for these approaches to contribute significantly to early diagnosis and intervention strategies for Parkinson’s Disease."

        "abstract": "Given high costs of Oncotype DX (ODX) testing, widely used in recurrence risk assessment for early-stage breast cancer, studies have predicted ODX using quantitative clinicopathologic variables. However, such models have incorporated only small cohorts. Using a cohort of patients from the National Cancer Database (NCDB, n = 53,346), we trained machine learning models to predict low-risk (0-25) or high-risk (26-100) ODX using quantitative estrogen receptor (ER)/progesterone receptor (PR)/Ki-67 status, quantitative ER/PR status alone, and no quantitative features. Models were externally validated on a diverse cohort of 970 patients (median follow-up 55 months) for accuracy in ODX prediction and recurrence. Comparing the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) in a held-out set from NCDB, models incorporating quantitative ER/PR (AUROC 0.78, 95% CI 0.77–0.80) and ER/PR/Ki-67 (AUROC 0.81, 95% CI 0.80–0.83) outperformed the non-quantitative model (AUROC 0.70, 95% CI 0.68–0.72). These results were preserved in the validation cohort, where the ER/PR/Ki-67 model (AUROC 0.87, 95% CI 0.81–0.93, p = 0.009) and the ER/PR model (AUROC 0.86, 95% CI 0.80–0.92, p = 0.031) significantly outperformed the non-quantitative model (AUROC 0.80, 95% CI 0.73–0.87). Using a high-sensitivity rule-out threshold, the non-quantitative, quantitative ER/PR and ER/PR/Ki-67 models identified 35%, 30% and 43% of patients as low-risk in the validation cohort. Of these low-risk patients, fewer than 3% had a recurrence at 5 years. These models may help identify patients who can forgo genomic testing and initiate endocrine therapy alone.

        "abstract": "Enteric viral pathogens are associated with a significant burden of childhood morbidity and mortality. We investigated the relationship between viral pathogens and child growth among under-5 children. We analyzed data from 5572/22,567 children enrolled in the Global Enteric Multicenter Study across seven study sites (2007–2011). Multiple linear regression was used to examine the association between the viral pathogens and changes of length/height-for-age (HAZ), weight-for-age (WAZ), and weight-for-length/height (WHZ) z-scores, stratified by diarrheal symptoms and adjusted for potential covariates. Rotavirus (18.51%) and norovirus (7.33%) were the most prevalent enteric viral pathogens among symptomatic and asymptomatic under-5 children, respectively. Infection with individual enteric viral pathogens hurts child growth in asymptomatic children. However, the relationship with HAZ was less clear and statistically non-significant. On the other hand, the combined viral pathogens demonstrated a strong negative influence on child growth [WAZ: β coef.: − 0.10 (95%, CI − 0.15, − 0.05); P < 0.001 and WHZ: β: − 0.12 (95% CI − 0.17, − 0.07); P < 0.001] among asymptomatic children. Infection with any viral pathogen was associated with growth shortfalls [HAZ: β: − 0.05 (95% CI − 0.09, 0.00); P = 0.03 and WAZ: β: − 0.11 (95% CI − 0.16, − 0.07); P < 0.001 and WHZ: β: − 0.13 (95% CI − 0.18, − 0.09); P < 0.001], though the relationship with HAZ was less evident and became statistically non-significant in older children. Notably, among symptomatic children with moderate-to-severe diarrhea, individual enteric viral pathogens, as well as the combined effects of these pathogens [WHZ: β: 0.07; (95% CI 0.01, 0.14); P = 0.03] and the presence of any virus [HAZ: β: 0.09 (95% CI 0.05, 0.13) & WAZ: β: 0.08 (95% CI 0.03, 0.12); P < 0.001], exhibited positive effects on child growth. While previous studies hypothesized that several viral pathogens had a conflicting controversial role in child growth, we find clear indications that enteric viral pathogens are associated with growth shortfalls, specifically among asymptomatic children. These findings highlight the need for preventive strategies targeting children with enteric viral pathogens, which could address the consequences of growth faltering."

        "abstract": "Determining the fundamental characteristics that define a face as \"feminine\" or \"masculine\" has long fascinated anatomists and plastic surgeons, particularly those involved in aesthetic and gender-affirming surgery. Previous studies in this area have relied on manual measurements, comparative anatomy, and heuristic landmark-based feature extraction. In this study, we collected retrospectively at Cedars Sinai Medical Center (CSMC) a dataset of 98 skull samples, which is the first dataset of this kind of 3D medical imaging. We then evaluated the accuracy of multiple deep learning neural network architectures on sex classification with this dataset. Specifically, we evaluated methods representing three different 3D data modeling approaches: Resnet3D, PointNet++, and MeshNet. Despite the limited number of imaging samples, our testing results show that all three approaches achieve AUC scores above 0.9 after convergence. PointNet++ exhibits the highest accuracy, while MeshNet has the lowest. Our findings suggest that accuracy is not solely dependent on the sparsity of data representation but also on the architecture design, with MeshNet's lower accuracy likely due to the lack of a hierarchical structure for progressive data abstraction. Furthermore, we studied a problem related to sex determination, which is the analysis of the various morphological features that affect sex classification. We proposed and developed a new method based on morphological gradients to visualize features that influence model decision making. The method based on morphological gradients is an alternative to the standard saliency map, and the new method provides better visualization of feature importance. Our study is the first to develop and evaluate deep learning models for analyzing 3D facial skull images to identify imaging feature differences between individuals assigned male or female at birth. These findings may be useful for planning and evaluating craniofacial surgery, particularly gender-affirming procedures, such as facial feminization surgery."

However, some concerns remain that they may cause serious cardiovascular adverse events (AEs), for which data are scarce. In this study, gradient boosting machine algorithm-based model was fitted to identify safety signals of serious cardiovascular AEs reported for tisagenlecleucel in the World Health Organization Vigibase up until February 2024. Input dataset, comprised of positive and negative controls of tisagenlecleucel based on its labeling information and literature search, was used to train the model. Then, we implemented the model to calculate the predicted probability of serious cardiovascular AEs defined by preferred terms included in the important medical event list from European Medicine Agency. There were 467 distinct AEs from 3,280 safety cases reports for tisagenlecleucel, of which 363 (77.7%) were classified as positive controls, 66 (14.2%) as negative controls, and 37 (7.9%) as unknown AEs. The prediction model had area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.76 in the test dataset application. Of the unknown AEs, six cardiovascular AEs were predicted as the safety signals: bradycardia (predicted probability 0.99), pleural effusion (0.98), pulseless electrical activity (0.89), cardiotoxicity (0.83), cardio-respiratory arrest (0.69), and acute myocardial infarction (0.58). Our findings underscore vigilant monitoring of acute cardiotoxicities with tisagenlecleucel therapy."

In this study, 7436 patients were classified as members of the derivation dataset, and 2284 patients were classified as members of the validation dataset. The point system model emerged as the optimal model among the tested predictive models for foreseeing sepsis mortality. For community-acquired sepsis, the model’s performance was satisfactory (derivation dataset AUC: 0.779, 95% CI 0.765–0.792; validation dataset AUC: 0.787, 95% CI 0.765–0.810). Similarly, for hospital-acquired sepsis, it performed well (derivation dataset AUC: 0.768, 95% CI 0.748–0.788; validation dataset AUC: 0.729, 95% CI 0.687–0.770). The calculator, accessible at https://avonlea76.shinyapps.io/shiny_app_up/, is user-friendly and compatible. The new predictive model of sepsis mortality is user-friendly and satisfactorily forecasts 28-day mortality.

Its early detection is a fundamentally important task in medicine. Classical detection approaches suffer from limited diagnostic accuracy or expose patients to possibly harmful radiation. Here we show how machine learning (ML) can outperform cardiologists in predicting the presence of stress-induced fCAD in terms of area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC: 0.71 vs. 0.64, p = 4.0E-13). We present two ML approaches, the first using eight static clinical variables, whereas the second leverages electrocardiogram signals from exercise stress testing. At a target post-test probability for fCAD of <15%, ML facilitates a potential reduction of imaging procedures by 15–17% compared to the cardiologist’s judgement. Predictive performance is validated on an internal temporal data split as well as externally. We also show that combining clinical judgement with conventional ML and deep learning using logistic regression results in a mean AUROC of 0.74."

        "abstract": "Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) serves as the primary receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 virus and has implications for the functioning of the cardiovascular system. Based on our previously published bioinformatic analysis, in this study we aimed to analyze the diagnostic and predictive utility of miRNAs (miR-10b-5p, miR-124-3p, miR-200b-3p, miR-26b-5p, miR-302c-5p) identified as top regulators of ACE2 network with potential to affect cardiomyocytes and cardiovascular system in patients with COVID-19. The expression of miRNAs was determined through qRT-PCR in a cohort of 79 hospitalized COVID-19 patients as well as 32 healthy volunteers. Blood samples and clinical data of COVID-19 patients were collected at admission, 7-days and 21-days after admission. We also performed SHAP analysis of clinical data and miRNAs target predictions and advanced enrichment analyses. Low expression of miR-200b-3p at the seventh day of admission is indicative of predictive value in determining the length of hospital stay and/or the likelihood of mortality, as shown in ROC curve analysis with an AUC of 0.730 and a p-value of 0.002. MiR-26b-5p expression levels in COVID-19 patients were lower at the baseline, 7 and 21-days of admission compared to the healthy controls (P < 0.0001). Similarly, miR-10b-5p expression levels were lower at the baseline and 21-days post admission (P = 0.001). The opposite situation was observed in miR-124-3p and miR-302c-5p. Enrichment analysis showed influence of analyzed miRNAs on IL-2 signaling pathway and multiple cardiovascular diseases through COVID-19-related targets. Moreover, the COVID-19-related genes regulated by miR-200b-3p were linked to T cell protein tyrosine phosphatase and the HIF-1 transcriptional activity in hypoxia. Analysis focused on COVID-19 associated genes showed that all analyzed miRNAs are strongly affecting disease pathways related to CVDs which could be explained by their strong interaction with the ACE2 network."

Our meta-analysis for pain reduction showed that transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation combined with instrument-assisted soft tissue mobilization treatment and pulsed electromagnetic therapy produced significant treatment on chronic lower back pain patients. Pooled evidence revealed the use of medical device related interventions resulted in 0.7 degree of pain reduction under a 0–10 scale. Significant improvement in disability scores, with a 7.44 degree reduction in disability level compared to a placebo using a 50 score range was also seen. Our analysis has shown that the optimal use of medical devices in a sustainable manner requires further research, needing larger cohort studies, greater gender parity, in a more diverse range of geographical locations."

Here we tested associations of rare and ultrarare coding variants with the in silico score for CAD in the UK Biobank, All of Us Research Program and BioMe Biobank. We identified associations in 17 genes; of these, 14 show at least moderate levels of prior genetic, biological and/or clinical support for CAD.

        "abstract": "With the advancement of internet communication and telemedicine, people are increasingly turning to the web for various healthcare activities. With an ever-increasing number of diseases and symptoms, diagnosing patients becomes challenging. In this work, we build a diagnosis assistant to assist doctors, which identifies diseases based on patient–doctor interaction. During diagnosis, doctors utilize both symptomatology knowledge and diagnostic experience to identify diseases accurately and efficiently. Inspired by this, we investigate the role of medical knowledge in disease diagnosis through doctor–patient interaction. We propose a two-channel, knowledge-infused, discourse-aware disease diagnosis model (KI-DDI), where the first channel encodes patient–doctor communication using a transformer-based encoder, while the other creates an embedding of symptom-disease using a graph attention network (GAT). In the next stage, the conversation and knowledge graph embeddings are infused together and fed to a deep neural network for disease identification. Furthermore, we first develop an empathetic conversational medical corpus comprising conversations between patients and doctors, annotated with intent and symptoms information. The proposed model demonstrates a significant improvement over the existing state-of-the-art models, establishing the crucial roles of (a) a doctor’s effort for additional symptom extraction (in addition to patient self-report) and (b) infusing medical knowledge in identifying diseases effectively. Many times, patients also show their medical conditions, which acts as crucial evidence in diagnosis. Therefore, integrating visual sensory information would represent an effective avenue for enhancing the capabilities of diagnostic assistants."

However, its utility in penetrating thoracic trauma (PTTrauma) for predicting the Critical Administration Threshold (CAT) has not been well-studied. This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of SI in predicting CAT in PTTrauma patients and compare its performance with the Assessment of Blood Consumption (ABC) and Revised Assessment of Bleeding and Transfusion (RABT) scores. We conducted a prognostic type 2, single-center retrospective observational cohort study on patients with PTTrauma and an Injury Severity Score (ISS) > 9. The primary exposure was SI at admission, and the primary outcome was CAT. Logistic regression and decision curve analysis were used to assess the predictive performance of SI and the PTTrauma score, a novel model incorporating clinical variables. Of the 620 participants, 53 (8.5%) had more than one CAT. An SI > 0.9 was associated with CAT (adjusted OR 4.89, 95% CI 1.64–14.60). The PTTrauma score outperformed SI, ABC, and RABT scores in predicting CAT (AUC 0.867, 95% CI 0.826–0.908). SI is a valuable predictor of CAT in PTTrauma patients. The novel PTTrauma score demonstrates superior performance compared to existing scores, highlighting the importance of developing targeted predictive models for specific injury patterns. These findings can guide clinical decision-making and resource allocation in the management of PTTrauma."

        "abstract": "Suturing skill scores have demonstrated strong predictive capabilities for patient functional recovery. The suturing can be broken down into several substep components, including needle repositioning, needle entry angle, etc. Artificial intelligence (AI) systems have been explored to automate suturing skill scoring. Traditional approaches to skill assessment typically focus on evaluating individual sub-skills required for particular substeps in isolation. However, surgical procedures require the integration and coordination of multiple sub-skills to achieve successful outcomes. Significant associations among the technical sub-skill have been established by existing studies. In this paper, we propose a framework for joint skill assessment that takes into account the interconnected nature of sub-skills required in surgery. The prior known relationships among sub-skills are firstly identified. Our proposed AI system is then empowered by the prior known relationships to perform the suturing skill scoring for each sub-skill domain simultaneously. Our approach can effectively improve skill assessment performance through the prior known relationships among sub-skills. Through the proposed approach to joint skill assessment, we aspire to enhance the evaluation of surgical proficiency and ultimately improve patient outcomes in surgery."

        "abstract": "The objective of this study is to use statistical techniques for the identification of transition points along the life course, aiming to identify fundamental changes in patient multimorbidity burden across phases of clinical care. This retrospective cohort analysis utilized 5.2 million patient encounters from 2013 to 2022, collected from a large academic institution and its affiliated hospitals. Structured information was systematically gathered for each encounter and three methodologies - clustering analysis, False Nearest Neighbor, and transitivity analysis - were employed to pinpoint transitions in patients’ clinical phase. Clustering analysis identified transition points at age 2, 17, 41, and 66, FNN at 4.27, 5.83, 5.85, 14.12, 20.62, 24.30, 25.10, 29.08, 33.12, 35.7, 38.69, 55.66, 70.03, and transitivity analysis at 7.27, 23.58, 29.04, 35.00, 61.29, 67.03, 77.11. Clustering analysis identified transition points that align with the current clinical gestalt of pediatric, adult, and geriatric phases of care. Notably, over half of the transition points identified by FNN and transitivity analysis were between ages 20 and 40, a population that is traditionally considered to be clinically homogeneous. Few transition points were identified between ages 3 and 17. Despite large social and developmental transition at those ages, the burden of multimorbidities may be consistent across the age range. Transition points derived through unsupervised machine learning approaches identify changes in the clinical phase that align with true differences in underlying multimorbidity burden. These transitions may be different from conventional pediatric and geriatric phases, which are often influenced by policy rather than clinical changes."

        "abstract": "**Ischemic stroke remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally. Despite the advances in thrombolytic therapy, notably recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA), patient outcomes are highly variable. This study aims to introduce a novel predictive model, the Acute Stroke Thrombolysis Non-Responder Prediction Model (ASTN-RPM), to identify patients unlikely to benefit from rtPA within the critical early recovery window. We conducted a retrospective cohort study at Baoding No.1 Central Hospital including 709 adult patients diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke and treated with intravenous alteplase within the therapeutic time window. The ASTN-RPM was developed using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression technique, incorporating a wide range of biomarkers and clinical parameters. Model performance was evaluated using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration plots, and Decision Curve Analysis (DCA). ASTN-RPM effectively identified patients at high risk of poor response to thrombolysis, with an AUC of 0.909 in the training set and 0.872 in the validation set, indicating high sensitivity and specificity. Key predictors included posterior circulation stroke, high admission NIHSS scores, extended door to needle time, and certain laboratory parameters like homocysteine levels. The ASTN-RPM stands as a potential tool for refining clinical decision-making in ischemic stroke management. By anticipating thrombolytic non-response, clinicians can personalize treatment strategies, possibly improving patient outcomes and reducing the burden of ineffective interventions. Future studies are needed for external validation and to explore the incorporation of emerging biomarkers and imaging data."

This is a challenge since tumor cells are often not visually distinguishable from peritumoral brain during surgery. To address this, we conducted a multicenter study testing whether the Sentry System could distinguish the three most common types of brain tumors from brain tissue in a label-free manner. The Sentry System is a new real time, in situ brain tumor detection device that merges Raman spectroscopy with machine learning tissue classifiers. Nine hundred and seventy-six in situ spectroscopy measurements and colocalized tissue specimens were acquired from 67 patients undergoing surgery for glioblastoma, brain metastases, or meningioma to assess tumor classification. The device achieved diagnostic accuracies of 91% for glioblastoma, 97% for brain metastases, and 96% for meningiomas. These data show that the Sentry System discriminated tumor containing tissue from non-tumoral brain in real time and prior to resection."

        "abstract": "Complicated associations between multiplexed environmental factors and aging are poorly understood. We manipulated aging using multidimensional metrics such as phenotypic age, brain age, and brain volumes in the UK Biobank. Weighted quantile sum regression was used to examine the relative individual contributions of multiplexed environmental factors to aging, and self-organizing maps (SOMs) were used to examine joint effects. Air pollution presented a relatively large contribution in most cases. We also found fair heterogeneities in which the same environmental factor contributed inconsistently to different aging metrics. Particulate matter contributed the most to variance in aging, while noise and green space showed considerable contribution to brain volumes. SOM identified five subpopulations with distinct environmental exposure patterns and the air pollution subpopulation had the worst aging status. This study reveals the heterogeneous associations of multiplexed environmental factors with multidimensional aging metrics and serves as a proof of concept when analyzing multifactors and multiple outcomes."

This retrospective cohort study, conducted in a medical center in Taiwan from 2015 to 2020, enrolled patients with AKI-D during intensive care unit stays. We aimed to develop and temporally test models for predicting dialysis liberation before hospital discharge using machine learning algorithms and explore early predictors. The dataset comprised 90 routinely collected variables within the first three days of dialysis initiation. Out of 1,381 patients who received acute dialysis, 27.3% experienced renal recovery. The cohort was divided into the training group (N = 1135) and temporal testing group (N = 251). The models demonstrated good performance, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.85 (95% CI, 0.81–0.88) and an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.69 (95% CI, 0.62–0.76) for the XGBoost model. Key predictors included urine volume, Charlson comorbidity index, vital sign derivatives (trend of respiratory rate and SpO2), and lactate levels. We successfully developed early prediction models for renal recovery by integrating early changes in vital signs and inputs/outputs, which have the potential to aid clinical decision-making in the ICU."

Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify and explore potential biomarkers for different subtypes of UC and examine their association with immune cell infiltration. We obtained UC RNA sequencing data from the GEO database, which included the training set GSE92415 and the validation set GSE87473 and GSE72514. UC patients were classified based on GLS and its associated genes using consensus clustering analysis. We identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in different UC subtypes through a differential expression analysis of the training cohort. Machine learning algorithms, including Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA), Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), and Support Vector Machine Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE), were utilized to identify marker genes for UC. The CIBERSORT algorithm was used to determine the abundance of various immune cells in UC and their correlation with UC signature genes. Finally, we validated the expression of GLS through in vivo and ex vivo experiments. The expression of GLS was found to be elevated in patients with UC compared to normal patients. GLS and its related genes were able to classify UC patients into two subtypes, C1 and C2. The C1 subtype, as compared to the C2 subtype, showed a higher Mayo score and poorer treatment response. A total of 18 DEGs were identified in both subtypes, including 7 up-regulated and 11 down-regulated genes. Four UC signature genes (CWH43, HEPACAM2, IL24, and PCK1) were identified and their diagnostic value was validated in a separate cohort (AUC > 0.85). Furthermore, we found that UC signature biomarkers were linked to the immune cell infiltration. CWH43, HEPACAM2, IL24, and PCK1 may serve as potential biomarkers for diagnosing different subtypes of UC, which could contribute to the development of targeted molecular therapy and immunotherapy for UC."

        "abstract": "Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the leading causes of adult blindness in the United States. Although studies applying traditional statistical methods have revealed that heavy metals may be essential environmental risk factors for diabetic retinopathy, there is a lack of analyses based on machine learning (ML) methods to adequately explain the complex relationship between heavy metals and DR and the interactions between variables. Based on characteristic variables of participants with and without DR and heavy metal exposure data obtained from the NHANES database (2003–2010), a ML model was developed for effective prediction of DR. The best predictive model for DR was selected from 11 models by receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis. Further permutation feature importance (PFI) analysis, partial dependence plots (PDP) analysis, and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis were used to assess the model capability and key influencing factors. A total of 1042 eligible individuals were randomly assigned to two groups for training and testing set of the prediction model. ROC analysis showed that the k-nearest neighbour (KNN) model had the highest prediction performance, achieving close to 100% accuracy in the testing set. Urinary Sb level was identified as the critical heavy metal affecting the predicted risk of DR, with a contribution weight of 1.730632 ± 1.791722, which was much higher than that of other heavy metals and baseline variables. The results of the PDP analysis and the SHAP analysis also indicated that antimony (Sb) had a more significant effect on DR. The interaction between age and Sb was more significant compared to other variables and metal pairs. We found that Sb could serve as a potential predictor of DR and that Sb may influence the development of DR by mediating cellular and systemic senescence. The study revealed that monitoring urinary Sb levels can be useful for early non-invasive screening and intervention in DR development, and also highlighted the important role of constructed ML models in explaining the effects of heavy metal exposure on DR."

        "abstract": "Malnutrition is a frequently underdiagnosed condition leading to increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. The Mount Sinai Health System (MSHS) deployed a machine learning model (MUST-Plus) to detect malnutrition upon hospital admission. However, in diverse patient groups, a poorly calibrated model may lead to misdiagnosis, exacerbating health care disparities. We explored the model’s calibration across different variables and methods to improve calibration. Data from adult patients admitted to five MSHS hospitals from January 1, 2021 - December 31, 2022, were analyzed. We compared MUST-Plus prediction to the registered dietitian’s formal assessment. Hierarchical calibration was assessed and compared between the recalibration sample (N = 49,562) of patients admitted between January 1, 2021 - December 31, 2022, and the hold-out sample (N = 17,278) of patients admitted between January 1, 2023 - September 30, 2023. Statistical differences in calibration metrics were tested using bootstrapping with replacement. Before recalibration, the overall model calibration intercept was −1.17 (95% CI: −1.20, −1.14), slope was 1.37 (95% CI: 1.34, 1.40), and Brier score was 0.26 (95% CI: 0.25, 0.26). Both weak and moderate measures of calibration were significantly different between White and Black patients and between male and female patients. Logistic recalibration significantly improved calibration of the model across race and gender in the hold-out sample. The original MUST-Plus model showed significant differences in calibration between White vs. Black patients. It also overestimated malnutrition in females compared to males. Logistic recalibration effectively reduced miscalibration across all patient subgroups. Continual monitoring and timely recalibration can improve model accuracy."

Data-driven methods may memorize ligand and protein training data rather than learning protein–ligand interactions. Here we show a scoring approach called EquiScore, which utilizes a heterogeneous graph neural network to integrate physical prior knowledge and characterize protein–ligand interactions in equivariant geometric space. EquiScore is trained based on a new dataset constructed with multiple data augmentation strategies and a stringent redundancy-removal scheme. On two large external test sets, EquiScore consistently achieved top-ranking performance compared to 21 other methods. When EquiScore is used alongside different docking methods, it can effectively enhance the screening ability of these docking methods. EquiScore also showed good performance on the activity-ranking task of a series of structural analogues, indicating its potential to guide lead compound optimization. Finally, we investigated different levels of interpretability of EquiScore, which may provide more insights into structure-based drug design."

        "abstract": "The global trend of advanced aging comes at the cost of amplified onset of age-related diseases. Dementia is a common multifactorial age-related neurodegenerative disorder, which manifests with progressive declines in cognitive functioning and ability to perform activities of daily living. As polices discourage institutionalized care, family members act as primary caregivers and endure increased vulnerability to physical and mental health problems secondary to care-related changes in life routine and relationships. Targeting clinically significant distress at earlier stages through valid brief measures may promote caregivers’ wellbeing and dementia care continuity/quality. This study aimed to determine the optimal cutoff score of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale 8-items (DASS-8) in a convenience sample of 571 European caregivers (Mean age = 53 ± 12 years, Italian = 74.4%, Swiss = 25.6%) through three methods. K-means clustering classified the sample into high- and low-distress clusters based on DASS-8 score of 19. Receiver operator curve (ROC) analysis using 48 and 7 cutoffs of the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) and the Three-Item University of California, Los Angeles, Loneliness Scale-version 3 (UCLALS3), revealed two DASS-8 cutoffs (12.5 and 14.5, area under the curve (AUC) = 0.85 and 0.92, p values < .001, 95% CI 0.82–0.88 and 0.89 to 0.94, sensitivity = 0.81 and 0.78, specificity = 0.76 and 0.89, Youden index = 0.57 and 0.67, respectively). Decision modeling produced two DASS-8 cutoffs (9.5 and 14.5) for predicting low and high caregiving burden and loneliness, respectively. According to the median of all DASS-8 cutoffs (14.5) the prevalence of mental distress was 50.8%. Distress correlated with key mental problems such as burnout and loneliness—in path analysis, DASS-8 scores were predicted by the ZBI, UCLALS3, care dependency, and receiving help with care, especially among older, female, and spouse caregivers. Further diagnostic workup should follow to confirm psycho-pathogenicity among caregivers with DASS-8 scores above 14.5. Investigations of the DASS-8 in other countries/populations may confirm the validity of this cutoff score."

As facial nerve outcomes remain challenging to prognosticate, we endeavored to utilize machine learning to decipher predictive factors relevant to facial nerve outcomes following microsurgical resection of VS. A database of patient-, tumor- and surgery-specific features was constructed via retrospective chart review of 242 consecutive patients who underwent microsurgical resection of VS over a 7-year study period. This database was then used to train non-linear supervised machine learning classifiers to predict facial nerve preservation, defined as House-Brackmann (HB) I vs. facial nerve injury, defined as HB II–VI, as determined at 6-month outpatient follow-up. A random forest algorithm demonstrated 90.5% accuracy, 90% sensitivity and 90% specificity in facial nerve injury prognostication. A random variable (rv) was generated by randomly sampling a Gaussian distribution and used as a benchmark to compare the predictiveness of other features. This analysis revealed age, body mass index (BMI), case length and the tumor dimension representing tumor growth towards the brainstem as prognosticators of facial nerve injury. When validated via prospective assessment of facial nerve injury risk, this model demonstrated 84% accuracy. Here, we describe the development of a machine learning algorithm to predict the likelihood of facial nerve injury following microsurgical resection of VS. In addition to serving as a clinically applicable tool, this highlights the potential of machine learning to reveal non-linear relationships between variables which may have clinical value in prognostication of outcomes for high-risk surgical procedures."

The differently mixed preparation variants were analyzed using the droplet evaporation method. The crystalline structures formed in dried droplets were photographed and analyzed using computer-supported image analysis and deep learning. Computer-supported evaluation and deep learning revealed that the patterns of the variant succussed under turbulence are characterized by lower complexity, whereas those obtained from the vortex-mixed variant are characterized by greater complexity compared to the diffusion-based mixed control variant. The droplet evaporation method could provide a relatively inexpensive means of testing the effects of liquid flow and serve as an alternative to currently used methods."

The pooled analysis increased the number of risk loci eightfold to 164, including three on chromosome X. Sex-specific meta-analyses revealed largely overlapping genetic predispositions of the sexes (rg = 0.96). Locus annotation prioritized druggable genes such as glutamate receptors 1 and 4, and Mendelian randomization indicated RLS as a causal risk factor for diabetes. Machine learning approaches combining genetic and nongenetic information performed best in risk prediction (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.82–0.91). In summary, we identified targets for drug development and repurposing, prioritized potential causal relationships between RLS and relevant comorbidities and risk factors for follow-up and provided evidence that nonlinear interactions are likely relevant to RLS risk prediction."

Here, we combine ex vivo MRI and serial histological imaging from 25 human MTL specimens to present a detailed, 3-D characterization of quantitative NFT burden measures in the space of a high-resolution, ex vivo atlas with cytoarchitecturally-defined subregion labels, that can be used to inform future in vivo neuroimaging studies. Average maps show a clear anterior to poster gradient in NFT distribution and a precise, spatial pattern with highest levels of NFTs found not just within the transentorhinal region but also the cornu ammonis (CA1) subfield. Additionally, we identify granular MTL regions where measures of neurodegeneration are likely to be linked to NFTs specifically, and thus potentially more sensitive as early AD biomarkers."

We here describe the deployment of a high-dimensional data-driven decision support model into an EHR and derive practical guidelines informed by this deployment that includes the necessary processes, stakeholders and design requirements for a successful deployment. For this, we describe our deployment of the chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) treatment infection model (CLL-TIM) as a stand-alone platform adjoined to an EPIC-based Danish Electronic Health Record (EHR), with the presentation of personalized predictions in a clinical context. CLL-TIM is an 84-variable data-driven prognostic model utilizing 7-year medical patient records and predicts the 2-year risk composite outcome of infection and/or treatment post-CLL diagnosis. As an independent validation cohort for this deployment, we used a retrospective population-based cohort of patients diagnosed with CLL from 2018 onwards (n = 1480). Unexpectedly high levels of missingness for key CLL-TIM variables were exhibited upon deployment. High dimensionality, with the handling of missingness, and predictive confidence were critical design elements that enabled trustworthy predictions and thus serves as a priority for prognostic models seeking deployment in new EHRs. Our setup for deployment, including automation and monitoring into EHR that meets Medical Device Regulations, may be used as step-by-step guidelines for others aiming at designing and deploying research algorithms into clinical practice."

However, utilizing such an approach results in as much as 10–15% of negative appendectomies. Hence, in the present study, we aimed to develop a machine learning (ML) model designed to reduce the number of negative appendectomies in pediatric patients with a high clinical probability of acute appendicitis. The model was developed and validated on a registry of 551 pediatric patients with suspected acute appendicitis that underwent surgical treatment. Clinical, anthropometric, and laboratory features were included for model training and analysis. Three machine learning algorithms were tested (random forest, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, logistic regression) and model explainability was obtained. Random forest model provided the best predictions achieving mean specificity and sensitivity of 0.17 ± 0.01 and 0.997 ± 0.001 for detection of acute appendicitis, respectively. Furthermore, the model outperformed the appendicitis inflammatory response (AIR) score across most sensitivity–specificity combinations. Finally, the random forest model again provided the best predictions for discrimination between complicated appendicitis, and either uncomplicated acute appendicitis or no appendicitis at all, with a joint mean sensitivity of 0.994 ± 0.002 and specificity of 0.129 ± 0.009. In conclusion, the developed ML model might save as much as 17% of patients with a high clinical probability of acute appendicitis from unnecessary surgery, while missing the needed surgery in only 0.3% of cases. Additionally, it showed better diagnostic accuracy than the AIR score, as well as good accuracy in predicting complicated acute appendicitis over uncomplicated and negative cases bundled together. This may be useful in centers that advocate for the conservative treatment of uncomplicated appendicitis. Nevertheless, external validation is needed to support these findings."

        "abstract": "With the continuous progress of technology, the subject of life science plays an increasingly important role, among which the application of artificial intelligence in the medical field has attracted more and more attention. Bell facial palsy, a neurological ailment characterized by facial muscle weakness or paralysis, exerts a profound impact on patients’ facial expressions and masticatory abilities, thereby inflicting considerable distress upon their overall quality of life and mental well-being. In this study, we designed a facial attribute recognition model specifically for individuals with Bell’s facial palsy. The model utilizes an enhanced SSD network and scientific computing to perform a graded assessment of the patients’ condition. By replacing the VGG network with a more efficient backbone, we improved the model’s accuracy and significantly reduced its computational burden. The results show that the improved SSD network has an average precision of 87.9% in the classification of light, middle and severe facial palsy, and effectively performs the classification of patients with facial palsy, where scientific calculations also increase the precision of the classification. This is also one of the most significant contributions of this article, which provides intelligent means and objective data for future research on intelligent diagnosis and treatment as well as progressive rehabilitation."

        "abstract": "Recognizing the pivotal role of circadian rhythm in the human aging process and its scalability through wearables, we introduce CosinorAge, a digital biomarker of aging developed from wearable-derived circadian rhythmicity from 80,000 midlife and older adults in the UK and US. A one-year increase in CosinorAge corresponded to 8–12% higher all-cause and cause-specific mortality risks and 3–14% increased prospective incidences of age-related diseases. CosinorAge also captured a non-linear decline in resilience and physical functioning, evidenced by an 8–33% reduction in self-rated health and a 3–23% decline in health-related quality of life score, adjusting for covariates and multiple testing. The associations were robust in sensitivity analyses and external validation using an independent cohort from a disparate geographical region using a different wearable device. Moreover, we illustrated a heterogeneous impact of circadian parameters associated with biological aging, with young (<45 years) and fast agers experiencing a substantially delayed acrophase with a 25-minute difference in peak timing compared to slow agers, diminishing to a 7-minute difference in older adults (>65 years). We demonstrated a significant enhancement in the predictive performance when integrating circadian rhythmicity in the estimation of biological aging over physical activity. Our findings underscore CosinorAge’s potential as a scalable, economic, and digital solution for promoting healthy longevity, elucidating the critical and multifaceted circadian rhythmicity in aging processes. Consequently, our research contributes to advancing preventive measures in digital medicine."

        "abstract": "Breast Cancer is the most common cancer among women globally. Despite significant improvements in overall survival, many tumours are refractory to therapy and so novel approaches are required to improve patient outcomes. We have evaluated patient-derived explants (PDEs) as a novel preclinical platform for breast cancer (BC) and implemented cutting-edge digital pathology and multi-immunofluorescent approaches for investigating biomarker changes in both tumour and stromal areas at endpoint. Short-term culture of intact fragments of BCs as PDEs retained an intact immune microenvironment, and tumour architecture was augmented by the inclusion of autologous serum in the culture media. Cell death/proliferation responses to FET chemotherapy in BC-PDEs correlated significantly with BC patient progression-free survival (p = 0.012 and p = 0.0041, respectively) and cell death responses to the HER2 antibody therapy trastuzumab correlated significantly with HER2 status (p = 0.018). These studies show that the PDE platform combined with digital pathology is a robust preclinical approach for informing clinical responses to chemotherapy and antibody-directed therapies in breast cancer. Furthermore, since BC-PDEs retain an intact tumour architecture over the short-term, they facilitate the preclinical testing of anti-cancer agents targeting the tumour microenvironment."

Hence, this study aim to identify, then validate, biomarkers that could predict if newly infected COVID-19 patients would subsequently require hospitalization or could recover safely with medication as outpatients. Serum cytokine/chemokine data from 129 COVID-19 patients within 7 days after the onset of symptoms in Bangladesh were used as training data. The majority of patients were infected with the Omicron variant and over 88% were vaccinated. Patients were  divided into those with mild symptoms who recovered, and those who deteriorated to moderate or severe illness. Using the Lasso method, 15 predictive markers were identified and used to classify patients into these two groups. The biomarkers were then validated in a cohort of 194 Covid patients in Japan with a predictive accuracy that exceeded 80% for patients infected with Delta and Omicron variants, and 70% for Wuhan and Alpha variants. In an environment of widespread vaccination, these biomarkers could help medical practitioners determine if newly infected COVID-19 patients will improve and can be managed on an out-patient basis, or if they will deteriorate and require hospitalization."

This research focused on assessing the viability of applying medical computer vision techniques to the task of segmenting individual teeth within a phantom. Using a virtual cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) system, we generated over 170,000 training datasets. These datasets were produced by varying the elemental densities and tooth sizes within the human phantom, as well as varying the X-ray spectrum, noise intensity, and projection cutoff intensity in the virtual CBCT system. The deep-learning (DL) based tooth segmentation model was trained using the generated datasets. The results demonstrate an agreement with manual contouring when applied to clinical CBCT data. Specifically, the Dice similarity coefficient exceeded 0.87, indicating the robust performance of the developed segmentation model even when virtual imaging was used. The present results show the practical utility of virtual imaging techniques in dentistry and highlight the potential of medical computer vision for enhancing precision and efficiency in dental imaging processes."

        "abstract": "Data categorization is a top concern in medical data to predict and detect illnesses; thus, it is applied in modern healthcare informatics. In modern informatics, machine learning and deep learning models have enjoyed great attention for categorizing medical data and improving illness detection. However, the existing techniques, such as features with high dimensionality, computational complexity, and long-term execution duration, raise fundamental problems. This study presents a novel classification model employing metaheuristic methods to maximize efficient positives on Chronic Kidney Disease diagnosis. The medical data is initially massively pre-processed, where the data is purified with various mechanisms, including missing values resolution, data transformation, and the employment of normalization procedures. The focus of such processes is to leverage the handling of the missing values and prepare the data for deep analysis. We adopt the Binary Grey Wolf Optimization method, a reliable subset selection feature using metaheuristics. This operation is aimed at improving illness prediction accuracy. In the classification step, the model adopts the Extreme Learning Machine with hidden nodes through data optimization to predict the presence of CKD. The complete classifier evaluation employs established measures, including recall, specificity, kappa, F-score, and accuracy, in addition to the feature selection. Data related to the study show that the proposed approach records high levels of accuracy, which is better than the existing models."

This study aimed to develop non-invasive prediction models for IgA nephropathy using machine learning. We collected retrospective data on demographic characteristics, blood tests, and urine tests of the patients who underwent kidney biopsy. The dataset was divided into derivation and validation cohorts, with temporal validation. We employed five machine learning models—eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), LightGBM, Random Forest, Artificial Neural Networks, and 1 Dimentional-Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN)—and logistic regression, evaluating performance via the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and explored variable importance through SHapley Additive exPlanations method. The study included 1268 participants, with 353 (28%) diagnosed with IgA nephropathy. In the derivation cohort, LightGBM achieved the highest AUROC of 0.913 (95% CI 0.906–0.919), significantly higher than logistic regression, Artificial Neural Network, and 1D-CNN, not significantly different from XGBoost and Random Forest. In the validation cohort, XGBoost demonstrated the highest AUROC of 0.894 (95% CI 0.850–0.935), maintaining its robust performance. Key predictors identified were age, serum albumin, IgA/C3, and urine red blood cells, aligning with existing clinical insights. Machine learning can be a valuable non-invasive tool for IgA nephropathy."

        "abstract": "Electromyography (EMG) is considered a potential predictive tool for the severity of knee osteoarthritis (OA) symptoms and functional outcomes. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), such as the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) and visual analog scale (VAS), are used to determine the severity of knee OA. We aim to investigate muscle activation and co-contraction patterns through EMG from the lower extremity muscles of patients with advanced knee OA patients and evaluate the effectiveness of an interpretable machine-learning model to estimate the severity of knee OA according to the WOMAC (pain, stiffness, and physical function) and VAS using EMG gait features. To explore neuromuscular gait patterns with knee OA severity, EMG from rectus femoris, medial hamstring, tibialis anterior, and gastrocnemius muscles were recorded from 84 patients diagnosed with advanced knee OA during ground walking. Muscle activation patterns and co-activation indices were calculated over the gait cycle for pairs of medial and lateral muscles. We utilized machine-learning regression models to estimate the severity of knee OA symptoms according to the PROMs using muscle activity and co-contraction features. Additionally, we utilized the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to interpret the contribution of the EMG features to the regression model for estimation of knee OA severity according to WOMAC and VAS. Muscle activity and co-contraction patterns varied according to the functional limitations associated with knee OA severity according to VAS and WOMAC. The coefficient of determination of the cross-validated regression model is 0.85 for estimating WOMAC, 0.82 for pain, 0.85 for stiffness, and 0.85 for physical function, as well as VAS scores, utilizing the gait features. SHAP explanation revealed that greater co-contraction of lower extremity muscles during the weight acceptance and swing phases indicated more severe knee OA. The identified muscle co-activation patterns may be utilized as objective candidate outcomes to better understand the severity of knee OA."

We therefore present SoccerMon, the largest soccer athlete dataset available today containing both subjective and objective metrics, collected from two different elite women’s soccer teams over two years. Our dataset contains 33,849 subjective reports and 10,075 objective reports, the latter including over six billion GPS position measurements. SoccerMon can not only play a valuable role in developing better analysis and prediction systems for soccer, but also inspire similar data collection activities in other domains which can benefit from subjective athlete reports, GPS position information, and/or time-series data in general."

This study aimed to find kinematic differences by surgical skill level. An AI algorithm was developed to identify X and Y coordinates of surgical instrument tips accurately from video. Kinematic analysis including fluctuation analysis was performed on 18 laparoscopic distal gastrectomy videos from three expert and three novice surgeons (3 videos/surgeon, 11.6 h, 1,254,010 frames). Analysis showed the expert surgeon cohort moved more efficiently and regularly, with significantly less operation time and total travel distance. Instrument tip movement did not differ in velocity, acceleration, or jerk between skill levels. The evaluation index of fluctuation β was significantly higher in experts. ROC curve cutoff value at 1.4 determined sensitivity and specificity of 77.8% for experts and novices. Despite the small sample, this study suggests AI-based object detection with fluctuation analysis is promising because skill evaluation can be calculated in real time with potential for peri-operational evaluation."

        "abstract": "Contaminated lake water and fish can be sources of bacterial pathogens of public health concern, including pathogenic E. coli. Within Ethiopia, specifically, Central Oromia, raw fish consumption is a common practice. Although there are few reports on occurrence of E. coli O157 in fish destined for human consumption and children under five years, information on the transmission pathways of E. coli O157 and other sorbitol non-fermenting (SN-F) E. coli from water-to-fish-to-human, and their virulence factors and antimicrobial resistant determinants along the fish supply chain is lacking. The study aimed to investigate the occurrence, molecular characteristics, and antimicrobial susceptibility of E. coli O157 and other SN-F E. coli strains in fish, lake water and humans in central Oromia, Ethiopia. A total of 750 samples (450 fish samples, 150 water samples, 150 human stool samples) were collected from five lakes and three health facilities. The samples were processed following the standard protocol recommended by European Food Safety Authority and Kirby–Bauer disc diffusion method for detection of the bacteria, and antimicrobial susceptibility tests, respectively. Molecular characterization of presumptive isolates was performed using Whole-Genome Sequencing (WGS) for serotyping, determination of virulence factors, antimicrobial resistance traits, and genetic linkage of the isolates. Overall, 3.9% (29/750) of the samples had SN-F E. coli; of which 6.7% (n = 10), 1.8% (n = 8) and 7.3% (n = 11) were retrieved from water, fish, and diarrheic human patients, respectively. The WGS confirmed that all the isolates were SN-F non-O157: H7 E. coli strains. We reported two new E. coli strains with unknown O-antigen from fish and human samples. All the strains have multiple virulence factors and one or more genes encoding for them. Genetic relatedness was observed among strains from the same sources (water, fish, and humans). Most isolates were resistant to ampicillin (100%), tetracycline (100%), cefotaxime (100%), ceftazidime (100%), meropenem (100%), nalidixic acid (93.1%) and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (79.3%). Majority of the strains were resistant to chloramphenicol (58.6%) and ciprofloxacin (48.3%), while small fraction showed resistance to azithromycin (3.45%). Isolates had an overall MDR profile of 87.5%. Majority, (62.1%; n = 18) of the strains had acquired MDR traits. Genes encoding for mutational resistance and Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) were also detected. In conclusion, our study revealed the occurrence of virulent and MDR SN-F E. coli strains in water, fish, and humans. Although no genetic relatedness was observed among strains from various sources, the genomic clustering among strains from the same sources strongly suggests the potential risk of transmission along the supply chain at the human–fish-environment interface if strict hygienic fish production is not in place. Further robust genetic study of the new strains with unknown O-antigens, and the epidemiology of SN-F E. coli is required to elucidate the molecular profile and public health implications of the pathogens."

Twenty males (mean ± SD; age = 25 ± 3 years, BMI = 21.7 ± 1.8, body fat = 12 ± 3%, maximal aerobic capacity (VO2max) = 64 ± 7 ml/kg/min) donned an ear-based wearable and performed a passive heating (PAH), running (RUN) and brisk walking trial (WALK).

Several Tc models, developed using Tac, Tea and heart rate, were validated against gastrointestinal temperature. Inclusion of Tea as a model input improved the accuracy of the ear-based Tc algorithm. Our best performing model (Trf3) displayed good group prediction errors (mean bias error = − 0.02 ± 0.26 °C) but exhibited individual prediction errors (percentage target attainment ± 0.40 °C = 88%) that marginally exceeded our validity criterion. Therefore, Trf3 demonstrates potential utility for group-based Tc monitoring, with additional refinement needed to extend its applicability to personalized heat strain monitoring."

We aimed to investigate the most robust model and modality combination by combining multi-modality image features based on demographic characteristics in six machine learning models. A total of 196 subjects were enrolled from four hospitals and the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset. During the four-year follow-up period, 47 (24%) patients progressed from MCI to AD. Volumes of the regions of interest, white matter hyperintensity, and regional Standardized Uptake Value Ratio (SUVR) were analyzed using T1, T2-weighted-Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery (T2-FLAIR) MRIs, and amyloid PET (αPET), along with automatically provided hippocampal occupancy scores (HOC) and Fazekas scales. As a result of testing the robustness of the model, the GBM model was the most stable, and in modality combination, model performance was further improved in the absence of T2-FLAIR image features. Our study predicts the probability of AD conversion in MCI patients, which is expected to be useful information for clinician’s early diagnosis and treatment plan design."

        "abstract": "Chest Radiography is a non-invasive imaging modality for diagnosing and managing chronic lung disorders, encompassing conditions such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, and COVID-19. While it is crucial for disease localization and severity assessment, existing computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems primarily focus on classification tasks, often overlooking these aspects. Additionally, prevalent approaches rely on class activation or saliency maps, providing only a rough localization. This research endeavors to address these limitations by proposing a comprehensive multi-stage framework. Initially, the framework identifies relevant lung areas by filtering out extraneous regions. Subsequently, an advanced fuzzy-based ensemble approach is employed to categorize images into specific classes. In the final stage, the framework identifies infected areas and quantifies the extent of infection in COVID-19 cases, assigning severity scores ranging from 0 to 3 based on the infection’s severity. Specifically, COVID-19 images are classified into distinct severity levels, such as mild, moderate, severe, and critical, determined by the modified RALE scoring system. The study utilizes publicly available datasets, surpassing previous state-of-the-art works. Incorporating lung segmentation into the proposed ensemble-based classification approach enhances the overall classification process. This solution can be a valuable alternative for clinicians and radiologists, serving as a secondary reader for chest X-rays, reducing reporting turnaround times, aiding clinical decision-making, and alleviating the workload on hospital staff."

        "abstract": "X-ray Phase Contrast Tomography (XPCT) based on wavefield propagation has been established as a high resolution three-dimensional (3D) imaging modality, suitable to reconstruct the intricate structure of soft tissues, and the corresponding pathological alterations. However, for biomedical research, more is needed than 3D visualisation and rendering of the cytoarchitecture in a few selected cases. First, the throughput needs to be increased to cover a statistically relevant number of samples. Second, the cytoarchitecture has to be quantified in terms of morphometric parameters, independent of visual impression. Third, dimensionality reduction and classification are required for identification of effects and interpretation of results. To address these challenges, we here design and implement a novel integrated and high throughput XPCT imaging and analysis workflow for 3D histology, pathohistology and drug testing. Our approach uses semi-automated data acquisition, reconstruction and statistical quantification. We demonstrate its capability for the example of lung pathohistology in Covid-19. Using a small animal model, different Covid-19 drug candidates are administered after infection and tested in view of restoration of the physiological cytoarchitecture, specifically the alveolar morphology. To this end, we then use morphometric parameter determination followed by a dimensionality reduction and classification based on optimal transport. This approach allows efficient discrimination between physiological and pathological lung structure, thereby providing quantitative insights into the pathological progression and partial recovery due to drug treatment. Finally, we stress that the XPCT image chain implemented here only used synchrotron radiation for validation, while the data used for analysis was recorded with laboratory \\(\\mu\\)CT radiation, more easily accessible for pre-clinical research."

        "abstract": "Dominance heritability in complex traits has received increasing recognition. However, most polygenic score (PGS) approaches do not incorporate non-additive effects. Here, we present GenoBoost, a flexible PGS modeling framework capable of considering both additive and non-additive effects, specifically focusing on genetic dominance. Building on statistical boosting theory, we derive provably optimal GenoBoost scores and provide its efficient implementation for analyzing large-scale cohorts. We benchmark it against seven commonly used PGS methods and demonstrate its competitive predictive performance. GenoBoost is ranked the best for four traits and second-best for three traits among twelve tested disease outcomes in UK Biobank. We reveal that GenoBoost improves prediction for autoimmune diseases by incorporating non-additive effects localized in the MHC locus and, more broadly, works best in less polygenic traits. We further demonstrate that GenoBoost can infer the mode of genetic inheritance without requiring prior knowledge. For example, GenoBoost finds non-zero genetic dominance effects for 602 of 900 selected genetic variants, resulting in 2.5% improvements in predicting psoriasis cases. Lastly, we show that GenoBoost can prioritize genetic loci with genetic dominance not previously reported in the GWAS catalog. Our results highlight the increased accuracy and biological insights from incorporating non-additive effects in PGS models."

        "abstract": "Fibrotic diseases affect multiple organs and are associated with morbidity and mortality. To examine organ-specific and shared biologic mechanisms that underlie fibrosis in different organs, we developed machine learning models to quantify T1 time, a marker of interstitial fibrosis, in the liver, pancreas, heart and kidney among 43,881 UK Biobank participants who underwent magnetic resonance imaging. In phenome-wide association analyses, we demonstrate the association of increased organ-specific T1 time, reflecting increased interstitial fibrosis, with prevalent diseases across multiple organ systems. In genome-wide association analyses, we identified 27, 18, 11 and 10 independent genetic loci associated with liver, pancreas, myocardial and renal cortex T1 time, respectively. There was a modest genetic correlation between the examined organs. Several loci overlapped across the examined organs implicating genes involved in a myriad of biologic pathways including metal ion transport (SLC39A8, HFE and TMPRSS6), glucose metabolism (PCK2), blood group antigens (ABO and FUT2), immune function (BANK1 and PPP3CA), inflammation (NFKB1) and mitosis (CENPE). Finally, we found that an increasing number of organs with T1 time falling in the top quintile was associated with increased mortality in the population. Individuals with a high burden of fibrosis in ≥3 organs had a 3-fold increase in mortality compared to those with a low burden of fibrosis across all examined organs in multivariable-adjusted analysis (hazard ratio = 3.31, 95% confidence interval 1.77–6.19; P = 1.78 × 10−4). By leveraging machine learning to quantify T1 time across multiple organs at scale, we uncovered new organ-specific and shared biologic pathways underlying fibrosis that may provide therapeutic targets."

        "abstract": "Determination of body composition (the relative distribution of fat, muscle, and bone) has been used effectively to assess the risk of progression and overall clinical outcomes in different malignancies. Sarcopenia (loss of muscle mass) is especially associated with poor clinical outcomes in cancer. However, estimation of muscle mass through CT scan has been a cumbersome, manually intensive process requiring accurate contouring through dedicated personnel hours. Recently, fully automated technologies that can determine body composition in minutes have been developed and shown to be highly accurate in determining muscle, bone, and fat mass. We employed a fully automated technology, and analyzed images from a publicly available cancer imaging archive dataset (TCIA) and a tertiary academic center. The results show that adrenocortical carcinomas (ACC) have relatively sarcopenia compared to benign adrenal lesions. In addition, functional ACCs have accelerated sarcopenia compared to non-functional ACCs. Further longitudinal research might shed further light on the relationship between body component distribution and ACC prognosis, which will help us incorporate more nutritional strategies in cancer therapy."

        "abstract": "As there are effective treatments to reduce hip fractures, identification of patients at high risk of hip fracture is important to inform efficient intervention strategies. To obtain a new tool for hip fracture prediction, we developed a protein-based risk score in the Cardiovascular Health Study using an aptamer-based proteomic platform. The proteomic risk score predicted incident hip fractures and improved hip fracture discrimination in two Trøndelag Health Study validation cohorts using the same aptamer-based platform. When transferred to an antibody-based proteomic platform in a UK Biobank validation cohort, the proteomic risk score was strongly associated with hip fractures (hazard ratio per s.d. increase, 1.64; 95% confidence interval 1.53–1.77). The proteomic risk score, but not available polygenic risk scores for fractures or bone mineral density, improved the C-index beyond the fracture risk assessment tool (FRAX), which integrates information from clinical risk factors (C-index, FRAX 0.735 versus FRAX + proteomic risk score 0.776). The developed proteomic risk score constitutes a new tool for stratifying patients according to hip fracture risk; however, its improvement in hip fracture discrimination is modest and its clinical utility beyond FRAX with information on femoral neck bone mineral density remains to be determined."

Hip fractures are predominantly diagnosed by radiologist review of radiographs. In this study, we developed a deep learning model by extending the VarifocalNet Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) for detection and localization of proximal femur fractures from plain radiography with clinically relevant metrics. We used a dataset of 823 hip radiographs of 150 subjects with proximal femur fractures and 362 controls to develop and evaluate the deep learning model. Our model attained 0.94 specificity and 0.95 sensitivity in fracture detection over the diverse imaging dataset. We compared the performance of our model against five benchmark FPN models, demonstrating 6–14% sensitivity and 1–9% accuracy improvement. In addition, we demonstrated that our model outperforms a state-of-the-art transformer model based on DINO network by 17% sensitivity and 5% accuracy, while taking half the time on average to process a radiograph. The developed model can aid radiologists and support on-premise integration with hospital cloud services to enable automatic, opportunistic screening for hip fractures."

        "abstract": "Advances in gene sequencing technologies have accelerated the identification of genetic variants, but better tools are needed to understand which are causal of disease. This would be particularly useful in fields where gene therapy is a potential therapeutic modality for a disease-causing variant such as inherited retinal disease (IRD). Here, we apply structure-based network analysis (SBNA), which has been successfully utilized to identify variant-constrained amino acid residues in viral proteins, to identify residues that may cause IRD if subject to missense mutation. SBNA is based entirely on structural first principles and is not fit to specific outcome data, which makes it distinct from other contemporary missense prediction tools. In 4 well-studied human disease-associated proteins (BRCA1, HRAS, PTEN, and ERK2) with high-quality structural data, we find that SBNA scores correlate strongly with deep mutagenesis data. When applied to 47 IRD genes with available high-quality crystal structure data, SBNA scores reliably identified disease-causing variants according to phenotype definitions from the ClinVar database. Finally, we applied this approach to 63 patients at Massachusetts Eye and Ear (MEE) with IRD but for whom no genetic cause had been identified. Untrained models built using SBNA scores and BLOSUM62 scores for IRD-associated genes successfully predicted the pathogenicity of novel variants (AUC = 0.851), allowing us to identify likely causative disease variants in 40 IRD patients. Model performance was further augmented by incorporating orthogonal data from EVE scores (AUC = 0.927), which are based on evolutionary multiple sequence alignments. In conclusion, SBNA can used to successfully identify variants as causal of disease in human proteins and may help predict variants causative of IRD in an unbiased fashion."

        "publication_date": "27 May 2024",
        "abstract": "Lack of efficacy or adverse drug response are common phenomena in pharmacological therapy causing considerable morbidity and mortality. It is estimated that 20–30% of this variability in drug response stems from variations in genes encoding drug targets or factors involved in drug disposition. Leveraging such pharmacogenomic information for the preemptive identification of patients who would benefit from dose adjustments or alternative medications thus constitutes an important frontier of precision medicine. Computational methods can be used to predict the functional effects of variant of unknown significance. However, their performance on pharmacogenomic variant data has been lackluster. To overcome this limitation, we previously developed an ensemble classifier, termed APF, specifically designed for pharmacogenomic variant prediction. Here, we aimed to further improve predictions by leveraging recent key advances in the prediction of protein folding based on deep neural networks. Benchmarking of 28 variant effect predictors on 530 pharmacogenetic missense variants revealed that structural predictions using AlphaMissense were most specific, whereas APF exhibited the most balanced performance. We then developed a new tool, APF2, by optimizing algorithm parametrization of the top performing algorithms for pharmacogenomic variations and aggregating their predictions into a unified ensemble score. Importantly, APF2 provides quantitative variant effect estimates that correlate well with experimental results (R2 = 0.91, p = 0.003) and predicts the functional impact of pharmacogenomic variants with higher accuracy than previous methods, particularly for clinically relevant variations with actionable pharmacogenomic guidelines. We furthermore demonstrate better performance (92% accuracy) on an independent test set of 146 variants across 61 pharmacogenes not used for model training or validation. Application of APF2 to population-scale sequencing data from over 800,000 individuals revealed drastic ethnogeographic differences with important implications for pharmacotherapy. We thus think that APF2 holds the potential to improve the translation of genetic information into pharmacogenetic recommendations, thereby facilitating the use of Next-Generation Sequencing data for stratified medicine."

Here, we apply Similarity Network Fusion (SNF) to cluster AMD patients into putative metabolomics-derived endotypes. Using a discovery cohort of 163 AMD patients from Boston, US, and a validation cohort of 214 patients from Coimbra, Portugal, we identified four distinct metabolomics-derived endotypes with varying retinal structural and functional characteristics, confirmed across both cohorts. Patients clustered into Endotype 1 exhibited a milder form of AMD and were characterized by low levels of amino acids in specific metabolic pathways. Meanwhile, patients clustered into both Endotype 3 and 4 were associated with more severe AMD and exhibited low levels of fatty acid metabolites and elevated levels of sphingomyelins and fatty acid metabolites, respectively. These preliminary findings indicate that metabolomics-derived endotyping may offer a refined strategy for categorizing AMD patients based on their specific pathophysiological underpinnings, rather than relying solely on traditional observational clinical indicators."

However, even though in vivo validation of such methods is crucial for their clinical translation, the biomedical field suffers from a lack of publicly available datasets for this purpose. Closing this gap, we generated the SPECTRAL Perfusion Arm Clamping dAtaset (SPECTRALPACA). It comprises ten spectral videos (∼20 Hz, approx. 20,000 frames each) systematically recorded of the hands of ten healthy human participants in different functional states. We paired each spectral video with concisely tracked regions of interest, and corresponding diffuse reflectance measurements recorded with a spectrometer. Providing the first openly accessible in human spectral video dataset for perfusion monitoring, our work facilitates the development and validation of new functional imaging methods."

However, current clinical assessment and treatment of dysphagia are still more symptom-focused due to our limited understanding of the sophisticated symptom-etiology associations causing swallowing disorders. This study aimed to elucidate the mechanisms giving rise to penetration flows into the laryngeal vestibule that results in aspirations with varying symptoms. Methods: Anatomically accurate, transparent throat models were prepared with a 45° down flapped epiglottis to simulate the instant of laryngeal closure during swallowing. Fluid bolus dynamics were visualized with fluorescent dye from lateral, rear, front, and endoscopic directions to capture key hydrodynamic features leading to aspiration. Three influencing factors, fluid consistency, liquid dispensing site, and dispensing speed, were systemically evaluated on their roles in liquid aspirations. Results: Three aspiration mechanisms were identified, with liquid bolus entering the airway through (a) the interarytenoid notch (notch overflow), (b) cuneiform tubercle recesses (recess overflow), and (c) off-edge flow underneath the epiglottis (off-edge capillary flow). Of the three factors considered, liquid viscosity has the most significant impact on aspiration rate, followed by the liquid dispensing site and the dispensing speed. Water had one order of magnitude higher aspiration risks than 1% w/v methyl cellulose solution, a mildly thick liquid. Anterior dispensing had higher chances for aspiration than posterior oropharyngeal dispensing for both liquids and dispensing speeds considered. The effects of dispending speed varied. A lower speed increased aspiration for anterior-dispensed liquids due to increased off-edge capillary flows, while it significantly reduced aspiration for posterior-dispensed liquids due to reduced notch overflows. Visualizing swallowing hydrodynamics from multiple orientations facilitates detailed site-specific inspections of aspiration mechanisms."

GMF digital twins utilized basic clinical and physiological biomarkers as inputs for identification and prediction of CKD. We employed four diverse multi-ethnic cohorts (n = 7072): a Singaporean cohort (EVAS, n = 289) and a North American cohort (NHANES, n = 1044) for baseline CKD identification, and two multi-center Singaporean cohorts (CDMD, n = 2119 and SDR, n = 3627) for 3-year CKD prediction and risk stratification. We subsequently conducted a comprehensive study utilizing a single dataset to evaluate the clinical utility of GMF for CKD prediction. The GMF-based identification model performed strongly, achieving an AUC between 0.80 and 0.82. In prediction, the GMF generated with complete parameters attained high performance with an AUC of 0.86, while with incomplete parameters, it achieved an AUC of 0.75. The GMF-based prediction model utilizing complete inputs is the standard implementation of our algorithm: HealthVector Diabetes®. We have established the GMF digital twin-based model as a robust clinical tool capable of predicting and stratifying the risk of future CKD within a 3-year time horizon. We report the correlation of GMF with basic input parameters, their ability to differentiate between future health states and medication status at baseline, and their capability to quantify CKD progression rates. This holistic methodology provides insights into patients’ health states and CKD progression rates based on GMF metabolic profile differences, enabling personalized care plans."

Linear regression models used pre-treatment variables of age, body mass index, CLA, anterior head translation, disability index, pain score, treatment frequency, duration and compliance. These models used the sci-kit-learn machine learning library within Python for implementing linear regression algorithms. The linear regression models demonstrated high precision and accuracy, and effectively explained 30–55% of the variability in post-treatment outcomes, the highest for the CLA. This pioneering study integrates machine learning into spinal rehabilitation. The developed models offer valuable information to customize interventions, set realistic expectations, and optimize treatment strategies based on individual patient characteristics as treated conservatively with rehabilitation programs using CET as part of multimodal care."

Assistive and rehabilitation devices such as prostheses, exo-skeletons, and serious gaming in virtual environments can help to restore some degree of function and alleviate pain after sensorimotor impairments. Myoelectric pattern recognition (MPR) has gained popularity in the past decades as it provides superior control over said devices, and therefore efforts to facilitate and improve performance in MPR can result in better rehabilitation outcomes. One possibility to enhance MPR is to employ transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to facilitate motor learning. Twelve healthy able-bodied individuals participated in this crossover study to determine the effect of tDCS on MPR performance. Baseline training was followed by two sessions of either sham or anodal tDCS using the dominant and non-dominant arms. Assignments were randomized, and the MPR task consisted of 11 different hand/wrist movements, including rest or no movement. Surface electrodes were used to record EMG and the MPR open-source platform, BioPatRec, was used for decoding motor volition in real-time. The motion test was used to evaluate performance. We hypothesized that using anodal tDCS to increase the excitability of the primary motor cortex associated with non-dominant side in able-bodied individuals, will improve motor learning and thus MPR performance. Overall, we found that tDCS enhanced MPR performance, particularly in the non-dominant side. We were able to reject the null hypothesis and improvements in the motion test’s completion rate during tDCS (28% change, p-value: 0.023) indicate its potential as an adjunctive tool to enhance MPR and motor learning. tDCS appears promising as a tool to enhance the learning phase of using assistive devices using MPR, such as myoelectric prostheses."

The global under-five mortality rate declined from 59% in 1990 to 38% in 2019, due to high immunization coverage. Despite the significant improvements in immunization coverage, about 20 million children were either unvaccinated or had incomplete immunization, making them more susceptible to mortality and morbidity. This study aimed to identify predictors of incomplete vaccination among children under-5 years in East Africa. An analysis of secondary data from six east African countries using Demographic and Health Survey dataset from 2016 to the recent 2021 was performed. A total weighted sample of 27,806 children aged (12–35) months was included in this study. Data were extracted using STATA version 17 statistical software and imported to a Jupyter notebook for further analysis. A supervised machine learning algorithm was implemented using different classification models. All analysis and calculations were performed using Python 3 programming language in Jupyter Notebook using imblearn, sklearn, XGBoost, and shap packages. XGBoost classifier demonstrated the best performance with accuracy (79.01%), recall (89.88%), F1-score (81.10%), precision (73.89%), and AUC 86%. Predictors of incomplete immunization are identified using XGBoost models with help of Shapely additive eXplanation. This study revealed that the number of living children during birth, antenatal care follow-up, maternal age, place of delivery, birth order, preceding birth interval and mothers’ occupation were the top predicting factors of incomplete immunization. Thus, family planning programs should prioritize the number of living children during birth and the preceding birth interval by enhancing maternal education. In conclusion promoting institutional delivery and increasing the number of antenatal care follow-ups by more than fourfold is encouraged."

        "abstract": "Accurate and early detection of pneumoconiosis using chest X-rays (CXR) is important for preventing the progression of this incurable disease. It is also a challenging task due to large variations in appearance, size and location of lesions in the lung regions as well as inter-class similarity and intra-class variance. Compared to traditional methods, Convolutional Neural Networks-based methods have shown improved results; however, these methods are still not applicable in clinical practice due to limited performance. In some cases, limited computing resources make it impractical to develop a model using whole CXR images. To address this problem, the lung fields are divided into six zones, each zone is classified separately and the zone classification results are then aggregated into an image classification score, based on state-of-the-art. In this study, we propose a dual lesion attention network (DLA-Net) for the classification of pneumoconiosis that can extract features from affected regions in a lung. This network consists of two main components: feature extraction and feature refinement. Feature extraction uses the pre-trained Xception model as the backbone to extract semantic information. To emphasise the lesion regions and improve the feature representation capability, the feature refinement component uses a DLA module that consists of two sub modules: channel attention (CA) and spatial attention (SA). The CA module focuses on the most important channels in the feature maps extracted by the backbone model, and the SA module highlights the spatial details of the affected regions. Thus, both attention modules combine to extract discriminative and rich contextual features to improve classification performance on pneumoconiosis. Experimental results show that the proposed DLA-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods for pneumoconiosis classification."

        "abstract": "An important challenge in the real-world management of patients with advanced clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (aRCC) is determining who might benefit from immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Here we performed a comprehensive multiomics mapping of aRCC in the context of ICB treatment, involving discovery analyses in a real-world data cohort followed by validation in independent cohorts. We cross-connected bulk-tumor transcriptomes across >1,000 patients with validations at single-cell and spatial resolutions, revealing a patient-specific crosstalk between proinflammatory tumor-associated macrophages and (pre-)exhausted CD8+ T cells that was distinguished by a human leukocyte antigen repertoire with higher preference for tumoral neoantigens. A cross-omics machine learning pipeline helped derive a new tumor transcriptomic footprint of neoantigen-favoring human leukocyte antigen alleles. This machine learning signature correlated with positive outcome following ICB treatment in both real-world data and independent clinical cohorts. In experiments using the RENCA-tumor mouse model, CD40 agonism combined with PD1 blockade potentiated both proinflammatory tumor-associated macrophages and CD8+ T cells, thereby achieving maximal antitumor efficacy relative to other tested regimens. Thus, we present a new multiomics and spatial map of the immune-community architecture that drives ICB response in patients with aRCC."

        "abstract": "Class imbalance is often unavoidable for radiomic data collected from clinical routine. It can create problems during classifier training since the majority class could dominate the minority class. Consequently, resampling methods like oversampling or undersampling are applied to the data to class-balance the data. However, the resampling must not be applied upfront to all data because it would lead to data leakage and, therefore, to erroneous results. This study aims to measure the extent of this bias. Five-fold cross-validation with 30 repeats was performed using a set of 15 radiomic datasets to train predictive models. The training involved two scenarios: first, the models were trained correctly by applying the resampling methods during the cross-validation. Second, the models were trained incorrectly by performing the resampling on all the data before cross-validation. The bias was defined empirically as the difference between the best-performing models in both scenarios in terms of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, balanced accuracy, and the Brier score. In addition, a simulation study was performed on a randomly generated dataset for verification. The results demonstrated that incorrectly applying the oversampling methods to all data resulted in a large positive bias (up to 0.34 in AUC, 0.33 in sensitivity, 0.31 in specificity, and 0.37 in balanced accuracy). The bias depended on the data balance, and approximately an increase of 0.10 in the AUC was observed for each increase in imbalance. The models also showed a bias in calibration measured using the Brier score, which differed by up to −0.18 between the correctly and incorrectly trained models. The undersampling methods were not affected significantly by bias. These results emphasize that any resampling method should be applied correctly only to the training data to avoid data leakage and, subsequently, biased model performance and calibration."

It exhibits a high prevalence among patients with a history of traumatic experiences, notably childhood sexual abuse (CSA). This study compared the efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) to the current pharmacological standard of care for individuals suffering from CSA-related FMS. Forty-eight participants diagnosed with FMS and a history of CSA were randomly assigned to either the HBOT group (60 sessions of 100% oxygen at 2 ATA for 90 min, with air breaks every 5 min) or the medication (MED) group (FDA-approved medications, Pregabalin and Duloxetine). The primary endpoint was the Fibromyalgia impact questionnaire (FIQ) score, while secondary endpoints encompassed emotional status and daily functioning questionnaires, as well as pain thresholds and conditioned pain modulation tests. Brain activity was evaluated through single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Results revealed a significant group-by-time interaction for the FIQ score favoring HBOT over MED (p < 0.001), with a large effect size (Cohen's d = − 1.27). Similar findings were observed in emotional symptoms and functional measures. SPECT imaging demonstrated an increase in activity in pre-frontal and temporal brain areas, which correlated with symptoms improvement. In conclusion, HBOT exhibited superior benefits over medications in terms of physical, functional, and emotional improvements among FMS patients with a history of CSA. This associated with increased activity in pre-frontal and temporal brain areas, highlighting the neuroplasticity effect of HBOT."

To achieve this, this study employed machine learning model to predict delirium in patients in palliative care and identified the significant features that influenced the model. A multicenter, patient-based registry cohort study in South Korea between January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2020. Delirium was identified by reviewing the medical records based on the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition. The study dataset included 165 patients with delirium among 2314 patients with advanced cancer admitted to the acute palliative care unit. Seven machine learning models, including extreme gradient boosting, adaptive boosting, gradient boosting, light gradient boosting, logistic regression, support vector machine, and random forest, were evaluated to predict delirium in patients with advanced cancer admitted to the acute palliative care unit. An ensemble approach was adopted to determine the optimal model. For k-fold cross-validation, the combination of extreme gradient boosting and random forest provided the best performance, achieving the following accuracy metrics: 68.83% sensitivity, 70.85% specificity, 69.84% balanced accuracy, and 74.55% area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The performance of the isolated testing dataset was also validated, and the machine learning model was successfully deployed on a public website (http://ai-wm.khu.ac.kr/Delirium/) to provide public access to delirium prediction results in patients with advanced cancer. Furthermore, using feature importance analysis, sex was determined to be the top contributor in predicting delirium, followed by a history of delirium, chemotherapy, smoking status, alcohol consumption, and living with family. Based on a large-scale, multicenter, patient-based registry cohort, a machine learning prediction model for delirium in patients with advanced cancer was developed in South Korea. We believe that this model will assist healthcare providers in treating patients with delirium and advanced cancer."

        "abstract": "Neonatal sepsis is a major cause of childhood mortality. Limited diagnostic tools and mechanistic insights have hampered our abilities to develop prophylactic or therapeutic interventions. Biomarkers in human neonatal sepsis have been repeatedly identified as associated with dysregulation of angiopoietin signaling and altered arachidonic acid metabolism. We here provide the mechanistic evidence in support of the relevance for these observations. Angiopoetin-1 (Ang-1), which promotes vascular integrity, was decreased in blood plasma of human and murine septic newborns. In preclinical models, administration of Ang-1 provided prophylactic protection from septic death. Arachidonic acid metabolism appears to be functionally connected to Ang-1 via reactive oxygen species (ROS) with a direct role of nitric oxide (NO). Strengthening this intersection via oral administration of arachidonic acid and/or the NO donor L-arginine provided prophylactic as well as therapeutic protection from septic death while also increasing plasma Ang-1 levels among septic newborns. Our data highlight that targeting angiogenesis-associated pathways with interventions that increase Ang-1 activity directly or indirectly through ROS/eNOS provide promising avenues to prevent and/or treat severe neonatal sepsis."

The digitization of healthcare in recent years has facilitated medical data scientists’ access to extensive hospital data, fostering AI-based research. A notable addition to this trend is the Salzburg Intensive Care database (SICdb), made publicly available in early 2023. Covering over 27 thousand intensive care admissions at the University Hospital Salzburg from 2013 to 2021, this dataset presents a valuable resource for AI-driven investigations. This article explores the SICdb and conducts a comparative analysis with the widely recognized Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care - version IV (MIMIC-IV) database. The comparison focuses on key aspects, emphasizing the availability and granularity of data provided by the SICdb, particularly vital signs and laboratory measurements. The analysis demonstrates that the SICdb offers more detailed information with higher data availability and temporal resolution for signal data, especially for vital signs, compared to the MIMIC-IV. This is advantageous for longitudinal studies of patients’ health conditions in the intensive care unit. The SICdb provides a valuable resource for medical data scientists and researchers. The database offers comprehensive and diverse healthcare data in a European country, making it well suited for benchmarking and enhancing AI-based healthcare research. The importance of ongoing efforts to expand and make public datasets available for advancing AI applications in the healthcare domain is emphasized by the findings."

Prototype production and modifications were repeated five times before producing the 3-D printed final product based on a patient’s preoperative chest computed tomography. A 24-item survey was used to rate the simulator, adapted from a previous report, with 16 young surgeons with an average of 6.2 years of experience in pediatric surgery for validation. Reusable parts of the thoracic cage were printed to combine with replaceable parts. Each structure was fabricated using diverse printing materials, and subsequently affixed to a frame. In evaluating the simulator, the scores for each factor were 4.33, 4.33, 4.27, 4.31, 4.63, and 4.75 out of 5, respectively, with the highest ratings in value and relevance. The global rating was 3.38 out of 4, with ten stating that it could be used with slight improvements. The most common comment from participants was that the esophageal anastomosis was close to the actual EA-TEF surgery. The 3D-printed thoracoscopic EA-TEF surgery simulator was developed and reflected the actual surgical environment. It could become an effective method of training young pediatric surgeons."

Twenty (19 patients) and 31 MRI scans (30 patients) of femurs with PFI and normal femurs, respectively, were used. Bone and cartilage segmentation of the distal femurs was performed and subsequently converted into 3D reconstructed models. The pointwise distance map showed anterior elevation of the trochlea, particularly at the central floor of the proximal trochlea, in the PFI models compared with the normal models. Principal component analysis examined shape variations in the PFI group, and several principal components exhibited shape variations in the trochlear floor and intercondylar width. Multivariate analysis showed that these shape components were significantly correlated with the PFI/non-PFI distinction after adjusting for age and sex. Our ML-based prediction model for PFI achieved a strong predictive performance with an accuracy of 0.909 ± 0.015, and an area under the curve of 0.939 ± 0.009 when using a support vector machine with a linear kernel. This study demonstrated that 3D MRI-based SSA can realistically visualize statistical results on surface models and may facilitate the understanding of complex shape features."

Leveraging artificial intelligence, particularly eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), we devise robust risk assessment models for T2D. Drawing upon comprehensive genetic and medical imaging datasets from 68,911 individuals in the Taiwan Biobank, our models integrate Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS), Multi-image Risk Scores (MRS), and demographic variables, such as age, sex, and T2D family history. Here, we show that our model achieves an Area Under the Receiver Operating Curve (AUC) of 0.94, effectively identifying high-risk T2D subgroups. A streamlined model featuring eight key variables also maintains a high AUC of 0.939. This high accuracy for T2D risk assessment promises to catalyze early detection and preventive strategies. Moreover, we introduce an accessible online risk assessment tool for T2D, facilitating broader applicability and dissemination of our findings."

To solve this task and reduce memory resource consumption, we develop a mini architecture of only 10 layers by modifying the deep residual neural network (ResNet), named ResNet mini architecture. To support the ResNet mini architecture in brain age prediction, the brain age dataset (OpenNeuro #ds000228) that consists of 155 study participants (three classes) and the Alzheimer MRI preprocessed dataset that consists of 6400 images (four classes) are employed. We compared the performance of the ResNet mini architecture with other popular networks using the two considered datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed architecture exhibits generality and robustness with high accuracy and less parameter number."

This retrospective cohort study used the Korean Neonatal Network (KNN) dataset to develop prediction models for severe IVH or early death in very-low-birth-weight infants (VLBWIs) using machine-learning algorithms. The study included VLBWIs registered in the KNN database. The outcome was the diagnosis of IVH Grades 3–4 or death within one week of birth. Predictors were categorized into three groups based on their observed stage during the perinatal period. The dataset was divided into derivation and validation sets at an 8:2 ratio. Models were built using Logistic Regression with Ridge Regulation (LR), Random Forest, and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB). Stage 1 models, based on predictors observed before birth, exhibited similar performance. Stage 2 models, based on predictors observed up to one hour after birth, showed improved performance in all models compared to Stage 1 models. Stage 3 models, based on predictors observed up to one week after birth, showed the best performance, particularly in the XGB model. Its integration into treatment and management protocols can potentially reduce the incidence of permanent brain injury caused by IVH during the early stages of birth."

        "abstract": "A significant number of pregnancies are lost in the first trimester and 1–2% are ectopic pregnancies (EPs). Early pregnancy loss in general can cause significant morbidity with bleeding or infection, while EPs are the leading cause of maternal mortality in the first trimester. Symptoms of pregnancy loss and EP are very similar (including pain and bleeding); however, these symptoms are also common in live normally sited pregnancies (LNSP). To date, no biomarkers have been identified to differentiate LNSP from pregnancies that will not progress beyond early gestation (non-viable or EPs), defined together as combined adverse outcomes (CAO). In this study, we present a novel machine learning pipeline to create prediction models that identify a composite biomarker to differentiate LNSP from CAO in symptomatic women. This prospective cohort study included 370 participants. A single blood sample was prospectively collected from participants on first emergency presentation prior to final clinical diagnosis of pregnancy outcome: LNSP, miscarriage, pregnancy of unknown location (PUL) or tubal EP (tEP). Miscarriage, PUL and tEP were grouped together into a CAO group. Human chorionic gonadotrophin β (β-hCG) and progesterone concentrations were measured in plasma. Serum samples were subjected to untargeted metabolomic profiling. The cohort was randomly split into train and validation data sets, with the train data set subjected to variable selection. Nine metabolite signals were identified as key discriminators of LNSP versus CAO. Random forest models were constructed using stable metabolite signals alone, or in combination with plasma hormone concentrations and demographic data. When comparing LNSP with CAO, a model with stable metabolite signals only demonstrated a modest predictive accuracy (0.68), which was comparable to a model of β-hCG and progesterone (0.71). The best model for LNSP prediction comprised stable metabolite signals and hormone concentrations (accuracy = 0.79). In conclusion, serum metabolite levels and biochemical markers from a single blood sample possess modest predictive utility in differentiating LNSP from CAO pregnancies upon first presentation, which is improved by variable selection and combination using machine learning. A diagnostic test to confirm LNSP and thus exclude pregnancies affecting maternal morbidity and potentially life-threatening outcomes would be invaluable in emergency situations."

JNK1 has been shown to regulate anxiety- and depressive-like behaviours in mice, however the effectors downstream of JNK1 are not known. Here we compare the phosphoproteomes from wild-type and Jnk1-/- mouse brains and identify JNK1-regulated signalling hubs. We next employ a zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae behavioural assay to identify an antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like (AA) phenotype based on 2759 measured stereotypic responses to clinically proven antidepressant and anxiolytic (AA) drugs. Employing machine learning, we classify an AA phenotype from extracted features measured during and after a startle battery in fish exposed to AA drugs. Using this classifier, we demonstrate that structurally independent JNK inhibitors replicate the AA phenotype with high accuracy, consistent with findings in mice. Furthermore, pharmacological targeting of JNK1-regulated signalling hubs identifies AKT, GSK-3, 14–3-3 ζ/ε and PKCε as downstream hubs that phenocopy clinically proven AA drugs. This study identifies AKT and related signalling molecules as mediators of JNK1-regulated antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like behaviours. Moreover, the assay shows promise for early phase screening of compounds with anti-stress-axis properties and for mode of action analysis."

These formulations, namely NSupple (without silymarin) and NSupple_Silybum (with silymarin) were tested over 180 days in overweight/obese volunteers from Brazil's southeastern region. We accessed fecal gut microbiota by partial 16S rRNA sequences; cytokines expression by CBA; anthropometrics, quality of life and sleep, as well as metabolic and hormonal parameters, at baseline (T0) and 180 days (T180) post-supplementation. Results demonstrated gut microbiota reshaping at phyla, genera, and species level post-supplementation. The Bacteroidetes phylum, Bacteroides, and Prevotella genera were positively modulated especially in the NSupple_Silybum group. Gut microbiota modulation was associated with improved sleep patterns, quality-of-life perception, cytokines expression, and anthropometric parameters post-supplementation. Our findings suggest that the nutraceutical blends positively enhance cardiometabolic and inflammatory markers.

We analyzed paired maternal and umbilical cord plasma collected during labor from 147 people with HIV taking antiretroviral therapy and 142 HIV-uninfected comparators. Though cytokine concentrations were overall similar between groups, using Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis we identified distinct cytokine profiles in each group, driven by higher IL-5 and lower IL-8 and MIP-1α levels in pregnant people with HIV and higher RANTES and E-selectin in HIV-unexposed umbilical cord plasma (P-value < 0.01). Furthermore, maternal RANTES, SDF-α, gro \\(\\mathrm{\\alpha }\\)-KC, IL-6, and IP-10 levels differed significantly by HIV serostatus (P < 0.01). Although global maternal and umbilical cord cytokine profiles differed significantly (P < 0.01), umbilical cord plasma profiles were similar by maternal HIV serostatus. We demonstrate that HIV infection is associated with a distinct maternal plasma cytokine profile which is not transferred across the placenta, indicating a placental role in coordinating local inflammatory response. Furthermore, maternal cytokine profiles in people with HIV suggest an incomplete shift from Th2 to Th1 immune phenotype at the end of pregnancy."

With the success of data-hungry Artificial Intelligence algorithms in medical image analysis, the benefits of sharing well-curated data cannot be overstated. To this end, we provide the largest publicly available MRI and iUS database of surgically treated brain tumors, including gliomas (n = 92), metastases (n = 11), and others (n = 11).

We propose a two-stage paradigm consisting of noninvasive cine-based CVD screening followed by cine and late gadolinium enhancement-based diagnosis. The screening and diagnostic models achieved high performance (area under the curve of 0.988 ± 0.3% and 0.991 ± 0.0%, respectively) in both internal and external datasets. Furthermore, the diagnostic model outperformed cardiologists in diagnosing pulmonary arterial hypertension, demonstrating the ability of artificial intelligence-enabled CMR to detect previously unidentified CMR features.

However, in comparison to most identified clinical determinants, the implications of individual genetic factors on antibody responses post-COVID-19 vaccination for breakthrough outcomes remain elusive. Here, we conducted a population-based study including 357,806 vaccinated participants with high-resolution HLA genotyping data, and a subset of 175,000 with antibody serology test results. We confirmed prior findings that single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with antibody response are predominantly located in the Major Histocompatibility Complex region, with the expansive HLA-DQB1*06 gene alleles linked to improved antibody responses. However, our results did not support the claim that this mutation alone can significantly reduce COVID-19 risk in the general population. In addition, we discovered and validated six HLA alleles (A*03:01, C*16:01, DQA1*01:02, DQA1*01:01, DRB3*01:01, and DPB1*10:01) that independently influence antibody responses and demonstrated a combined effect across HLA genes on the risk of breakthrough COVID-19 outcomes. Lastly, we estimated that COVID-19 vaccine-induced antibody positivity provides approximately 20% protection against infection and 50% protection against severity. These findings have immediate implications for functional studies on HLA molecules and can inform future personalised vaccination strategies."

        "abstract": "Our aim was to develop a machine learning-based predictor for early mortality and severe intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) in very-low birth weight (VLBW) preterm infants in Taiwan. We collected retrospective data from VLBW infants, dividing them into two cohorts: one for model development and internal validation (Cohort 1, 2016–2021), and another for external validation (Cohort 2, 2022). Primary outcomes included early mortality, severe IVH, and early poor outcomes (a combination of both). Data preprocessing involved 23 variables, with the top four predictors identified as gestational age, birth body weight, 5-min Apgar score, and endotracheal tube ventilation. Six machine learning algorithms were employed. Among 7471 infants analyzed, the selected predictors consistently performed well across all outcomes. Logistic regression and neural network models showed the highest predictive performance (AUC 0.81–0.90 in both internal and external validation) and were well-calibrated, confirmed by calibration plots and the lowest two mean Brier scores (0.0685 and 0.0691). We developed a robust machine learning-based outcome predictor using only four accessible variables, offering valuable prognostic information for parents and aiding healthcare providers in decision-making."

        "abstract": "Advancements in clinical treatment are increasingly constrained by the limitations of supervised learning techniques, which depend heavily on large volumes of annotated data. The annotation process is not only costly but also demands substantial time from clinical specialists. Addressing this issue, we introduce the S4MI (Self-Supervision and Semi-Supervision for Medical Imaging) pipeline, a novel approach that leverages advancements in self-supervised and semi-supervised learning. These techniques engage in auxiliary tasks that do not require labeling, thus simplifying the scaling of machine supervision compared to fully-supervised methods. Our study benchmarks these techniques on three distinct medical imaging datasets to evaluate their effectiveness in classification and segmentation tasks. Notably, we observed that self-supervised learning significantly surpassed the performance of supervised methods in the classification of all evaluated datasets. Remarkably, the semi-supervised approach demonstrated superior outcomes in segmentation, outperforming fully-supervised methods while using 50% fewer labels across all datasets. In line with our commitment to contributing to the scientific community, we have made the S4MI code openly accessible, allowing for broader application and further development of these methods.

        "abstract": "Cervical cancer, the second most prevalent cancer affecting women, arises from abnormal cell growth in the cervix, a crucial anatomical structure within the uterus. The significance of early detection cannot be overstated, prompting the use of various screening methods such as Pap smears, colposcopy, and Human Papillomavirus (HPV) testing to identify potential risks and initiate timely intervention. These screening procedures encompass visual inspections, Pap smears, colposcopies, biopsies, and HPV-DNA testing, each demanding the specialized knowledge and skills of experienced physicians and pathologists due to the inherently subjective nature of cancer diagnosis. In response to the imperative for efficient and intelligent screening, this article introduces a groundbreaking methodology that leverages pre-trained deep neural network models, including Alexnet, Resnet-101, Resnet-152, and InceptionV3, for feature extraction. The fine-tuning of these models is accompanied by the integration of diverse machine learning algorithms, with ResNet152 showcasing exceptional performance, achieving an impressive accuracy rate of 98.08%. It is noteworthy that the SIPaKMeD dataset, publicly accessible and utilized in this study, contributes to the transparency and reproducibility of our findings. The proposed hybrid methodology combines aspects of DL and ML for cervical cancer classification. Most intricate and complicated features from images can be extracted through DL. Further various ML algorithms can be implemented on extracted features. This innovative approach not only holds promise for significantly improving cervical cancer detection but also underscores the transformative potential of intelligent automation within the realm of medical diagnostics, paving the way for more accurate and timely interventions."

        "publication_date": "11 May 2024",
        "abstract": "Muscular dystrophies (MD) are a group of genetic neuromuscular disorders that cause progressive weakness and loss of muscles over time, influencing 1 in 3500–5000 children worldwide. New and exciting treatment options have led to a critical need for a clinical post-marketing surveillance tool to confirm the efficacy and safety of these treatments after individuals receive them in a commercial setting. For MDs, functional gait assessment is a common approach to evaluate the efficacy of the treatments because muscle weakness is reflected in individuals’ walking patterns. However, there is little incentive for the family to continue to travel for such assessments due to the lack of access to specialty centers. While various existing sensing devices, such as cameras, force plates, and wearables can assess gait at home, they are limited by privacy concerns, area of coverage, and discomfort in carrying devices, which is not practical for long-term, continuous monitoring in daily settings. In this study, we introduce a novel functional gait assessment system using ambient floor vibrations, which is non-invasive and scalable, requiring only low-cost and sparsely deployed geophone sensors attached to the floor surface, suitable for in-home usage. Our system captures floor vibrations generated by footsteps from patients while they walk around and analyzes such vibrations to extract essential gait health information. To enhance interpretability and reliability under various sensing scenarios, we translate the signal patterns of floor vibration to pathological gait patterns related to MD, and develop a hierarchical learning algorithm that aggregates insights from individual footsteps to estimate a person’s overall gait performance. When evaluated through real-world experiments with 36 subjects (including 15 patients with MD), our floor vibration sensing system achieves a 94.8% accuracy in predicting functional gait stages for patients with MD. Our approach enables accurate, accessible, and scalable functional gait assessment, bringing MD progressive tracking into real life."

        "abstract": "In this study, we have presented a novel probabilistic model called the neutrosophic Burr-III distribution, designed for applications in neutrosophic surface analysis. Neutrosophic analysis allows for the incorporation of vague and imprecise information, reflecting the reality that many real-world problems involve ambiguous data. This ability to handle vagueness can lead to more robust and realistic models especially in situation where classical models fall short. We have also explored the neutrosophic Burr-III distribution in order to deal with the ambiguity and vagueness in the data where the classical Burr-III distribution falls short. This distribution offers valuable insights into various reliability properties, moment expressions, order statistics, and entropy measures, making it a versatile tool for analyzing complex data. To assess the practical relevance of our proposed distribution, we applied it to real-world data sets and compared its performance against the classical Burr-III distribution. The findings revealed that the neutrosophic Burr-III distribution outperformed than the classical Burr-III distribution in capturing the underlying data characteristics, highlighting its potential as a superior modeling toolin various fields."

We investigate the ability of Gompertz-type empiric models to provide accurate prediction up to two and three weeks to give a large window of preparation in case of a surge in virus transmission. We investigate the stability of the prediction and its accuracy using bi-weekly predictions during the last trimester of 2020 and 2021. Using data from 2020, we show that understanding and correcting for the daily reporting structure of cases in the different countries is key to accomplish accurate predictions. Furthermore, we found that filtering out predictions that are highly unstable to changes in the parameters of the model, which are roughly 20%, reduces strongly the number of predictions that are way-off. The method is then tested for robustness with data from 2021. We found that, for this data, only 1–2% of the one-week predictions were off by more than 50%. This increased to 3% for two-week predictions, and only for three-week predictions it reached 10%."

Sutherland’s classification has been developed 40 years ago. Ever since, the state-of-the-art medical care has improved and boys with DMD are now longer ambulatory. Therefore, the gait classification requires an update. The overall aim was to develop an up-to-date, valid DMD gait classification. A total of 137 three-dimensional gait analysis sessions were collected in 30 boys with DMD, aged 4.6–17 years. Three classes were distinguished, which only partly aligned with increasing severity of gait deviations. Apart from the mildly affected pattern, two more severely affected gait patterns were found, namely the tiptoeing pattern and the flexion pattern with distinct anterior pelvic tilt and posterior trunk leaning, which showed most severe deviations at the ankle or at the proximal segments/joints, respectively. The agreement between Sutherland’s and the current classification was low, suggesting that gait pathology with the current state-of-the-art medical care has changed. However, overlap between classes, especially between the two more affected classes, highlights the complexity of the continuous gait changes. Therefore, caution is required when classifying individual boys with DMD into classes."

Additionally, images, videos, and documents speed data administration, fostering both individual and organizational efficiency. Healthcare providers use tools like X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans to improve diagnostic and therapeutic capacities, highlighting the importance of these tools in contemporary communication, data processing, and healthcare. Protecting medical data becomes essential for maintaining patient confidentiality and service dependability in a time when digital assets are crucial to the healthcare industry. In order to overcome this issue, this study analyses the DWT-HD-SVD algorithm-based invisible watermarking in medical data. The main goal is to verify medical data by looking at a DWT-based hybrid technique used on X-ray images with various watermark sizes (256*256, 128*128, 64*64). The algorithm’s imperceptibility and robustness are examined using metrics like Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) and are analyzed using Normalized Connection (NC), Bit Error Rate (BER), and Bit Error Rate (BCR) in order to evaluate its resistance to various attacks. The results show that the method works better with smaller watermark sizes than it does with larger ones."

We implement persistent homology (PH), a topological tool for studying the pattern of data, to analyze echocardiography-based strain data and differentiate between rare diseases like constrictive pericarditis (CP) and restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM). Patient population (retrospectively registered) included those presenting with heart failure due to CP (n = 51), RCM (n = 47), and patients without heart failure symptoms (n = 53). Longitudinal, radial, and circumferential strains/strain rates for left ventricular segments were processed into topological feature vectors using Machine learning PH workflow. In differentiating CP and RCM, the PH workflow model had a ROC AUC of 0.94 (Sensitivity = 92%, Specificity = 81%), compared with the GLS model AUC of 0.69 (Sensitivity = 65%, Specificity = 66%). In differentiating between all three conditions, the PH workflow model had an AUC of 0.83 (Sensitivity = 68%, Specificity = 84%), compared with the GLS model AUC of 0.68 (Sensitivity = 52% and Specificity = 76%). By employing persistent homology to differentiate the “pattern” of cardiac deformations, our machine-learning approach provides reasonable accuracy when evaluating small datasets and aids in understanding and visualizing patterns of cardiac imaging data in clinically challenging disease states."

We externally validated the model in 3 large cohort studies, ARIC (N = 14,484), CARDIA (N = 4,124) and MESA (N = 4,672). The model, Algorithmic Risk Inspection for Screening Elevated Lp(a) (ARISE), reduced the number needed to test to find one individual with elevated Lp(a) by up to 67.3%, based on the probability threshold, with consistent performance across external validation cohorts. ARISE could be used to optimize screening for elevated Lp(a) using commonly available clinical features, with the potential for its deployment in electronic health records to enhance the yield of Lp(a) testing in real-world settings."

This study of 3,476 de-identified participants (4,019 before data exclusion) quantified the prediction of four suicidal thought and behavior (STB) variables using a short reward/aversion judgment task and a limited set of demographic and mental health surveys. The focus was to produce a simple, quick and objective framework for assessing STB that might be automatable, without the use of big data. A balanced random forest classifier performed better than a Gaussian mixture model and four standard machine learning classifiers for predicting passive suicide ideation, active suicide ideation, suicide planning and planning for safety. Accuracies ranged from 78% to 92% (optimal area under the curve between 0.80 and 0.95) without overfitting, and peak performance was observed for predicting suicide planning. The relative importance of features for prediction showed distinct weighting across judgment variables, contributing between 40% and 64% to prediction per Gini scores. Mediation/moderation analyses showed that depression, anxiety, loneliness and age variables moderated the judgment variables, indicating that the interaction of judgment with mental health and demographic indices is fundamental for the high-accuracy prediction of STB. These findings suggest the feasibility of an efficient and highly scalable system for suicide assessment, without requiring psychiatric records or neural measures. The findings suggest that STB might be understood within a cognitive framework for judgment with quantitative variables whose unique constellation separates passive and active suicidal thought (ideation) from suicide planning and planning for safety."

Imaging the matrix densities of proteins like collagen in fixed tissue sections with suitable stains and labels is a standard for diagnosis and staging. However, fine changes in matrix density are difficult to realize by conventional histological staining and microscopy as the matrix fibrils are finer than the resolving capacity of these microscopes. The dyes further blur the outline of the matrix and add a background that bottlenecks high-precision early diagnosis of matrix diseases. Here we demonstrate the multiple signal classification method-MUSICAL-otherwise a computational super-resolution microscopy technique to precisely estimate matrix density in fixed tissue sections using fibril autofluorescence with image stacks acquired on a conventional epifluorescence microscope. We validated the diagnostic and staging performance of the method in extracted collagen fibrils, mouse skin during repair, and pre-cancers in human oral mucosa. The method enables early high-precision label-free diagnosis of matrix-associated fibrotic diseases without needing additional infrastructure or rigorous clinical training."

Here, we aim to present our approach for analyzing multimodal data using unsupervised and supervised sparse linear methods in a COVID-19 patient cohort. This prospective cohort study of 149 adult patients was conducted in a tertiary care academic center. First, we used sparse canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to identify and quantify relationships across different data modalities, including viral genome sequencing, imaging, clinical data, and laboratory results. Then, we used cooperative learning to predict the clinical outcome of COVID-19 patients: Intensive care unit admission. We show that serum biomarkers representing severe disease and acute phase response correlate with original and wavelet radiomics features in the LLL frequency channel (cor(Xu1, Zv1) = 0.596, p value < 0.001). Among radiomics features, histogram-based first-order features reporting the skewness, kurtosis, and uniformity have the lowest negative, whereas entropy-related features have the highest positive coefficients. Moreover, unsupervised analysis of clinical data and laboratory results gives insights into distinct clinical phenotypes. Leveraging the availability of global viral genome databases, we demonstrate that the Word2Vec natural language processing model can be used for viral genome encoding. It not only separates major SARS-CoV-2 variants but also allows the preservation of phylogenetic relationships among them. Our quadruple model using Word2Vec encoding achieves better prediction results in the supervised task. The model yields area under the curve (AUC) and accuracy values of 0.87 and 0.77, respectively. Our study illustrates that sparse CCA analysis and cooperative learning are powerful techniques for handling high-dimensional, multimodal data to investigate multivariate associations in unsupervised and supervised tasks."

Lifestyle habits affecting CCVD development were analyzed using five causal inference methods. This study included 473,734 patients aged ≥ 40 years who underwent specific health examinations in Kanazawa, Japan between 2009 and 2018 to collect data on basic physical information, lifestyle habits, and laboratory parameters such as diabetes, lipid metabolism, renal function, and liver function. Four machine learning algorithms were used: Random Forest, Logistic regression, Light Gradient Boosting Machine, and eXtreme-Gradient-Boosting (XGBoost). The XGBoost model exhibited superior area under the curve (AUC), with mean values of 0.770 (± 0.003), 0.758 (± 0.003), and 0.845 (± 0.005) for stroke, IHD, and CCVD, respectively. The results of the five causal inference analyses were summarized, and lifestyle behavior changes were observed after the onset of CCVD. A causal relationship from ‘reduced mastication’ to ‘weight gain’ was found for all causal species theory methods. This prediction algorithm can screen for asymptomatic myocardial ischemia and stroke. By selecting high-risk patients suspected of having CCVD, resources can be used more efficiently for secondary testing."

Here we show that non-coding mutations in a (TTTG)4 short tandem repeat (STR) underlie dominantly inherited RTSH in all 82 affected participants from 12 unrelated families. The STR is contained in a primate-specific Alu retrotransposon with thyroid-specific cis-regulatory chromatin features. Fiber-seq and RNA-seq studies revealed that the mutant STR activates a thyroid-specific enhancer cluster, leading to haplotype-specific upregulation of the bicistronic MIR7-2/MIR1179 locus 35 kb downstream and overexpression of its microRNA products in the participants’ thyrocytes. An imbalance in signaling pathways targeted by these micro-RNAs provides a working model for this cause of RTSH.

        "abstract": "Reverse zoonotic respiratory diseases threaten great apes across Sub-Saharan Africa. Studies of wild chimpanzees have identified the causative agents of most respiratory disease outbreaks as “common cold” paediatric human pathogens, but reverse zoonotic transmission pathways have remained unclear. Between May 2019 and August 2021, we conducted a prospective cohort study of 234 children aged 3–11 years in communities bordering Kibale National Park, Uganda, and 30 adults who were forest workers and regularly entered the park. We collected 2047 respiratory symptoms surveys to quantify clinical severity and simultaneously collected 1989 nasopharyngeal swabs approximately monthly for multiplex viral diagnostics. Throughout the course of the study, we also collected 445 faecal samples from 55 wild chimpanzees living nearby in Kibale in social groups that have experienced repeated, and sometimes lethal, epidemics of human-origin respiratory viral disease. We characterized respiratory pathogens in each cohort and examined statistical associations between PCR positivity for detected pathogens and potential risk factors. Children exhibited high incidence rates of respiratory infections, whereas incidence rates in adults were far lower. COVID-19 lockdown in 2020–2021 significantly decreased respiratory disease incidence in both people and chimpanzees. Human respiratory infections peaked in June and September, corresponding to when children returned to school. Rhinovirus, which caused a 2013 outbreak that killed 10% of chimpanzees in a Kibale community, was the most prevalent human pathogen throughout the study and the only pathogen present at each monthly sampling, even during COVID-19 lockdown. Rhinovirus was also most likely to be carried asymptomatically by adults. Although we did not detect human respiratory pathogens in the chimpanzees during the cohort study, we detected human metapneumovirus in two chimpanzees from a February 2023 outbreak that were genetically similar to viruses detected in study participants in 2019. Our data suggest that respiratory pathogens circulate in children and that adults become asymptomatically infected during high-transmission times of year. These asymptomatic adults may then unknowingly carry the pathogens into forest and infect chimpanzees. This conclusion, in turn, implies that intervention strategies based on respiratory symptoms in adults are unlikely to be effective for reducing reverse zoonotic transmission of respiratory viruses to chimpanzees."

        "abstract": "Multiple ophthalmic diseases lead to decreased capillary perfusion that can be visualized using optical coherence tomography angiography images. To quantify the decrease in perfusion, past studies have often used the vessel density, which is the percentage of vessel pixels in the image. However, this method is often not sensitive enough to detect subtle changes in early pathology. More recent methods are based on quantifying non-perfused or intercapillary areas between the vessels. These methods rely upon the accuracy of vessel segmentation, which is a challenging task and therefore a limiting factor for reliability. Intercapillary areas computed from perfusion-distance measures are less sensitive to errors in the vessel segmentation since the distance to the next vessel is only slightly changing if gaps are present in the segmentation. We present a novel method for distinguishing between glaucoma patients and healthy controls based on features computed from the probability density function of these perfusion-distance areas. The proposed approach is evaluated on different capillary plexuses and outperforms previously proposed methods that use handcrafted features for classification. Moreover the results of the proposed method are in the same range as the ones of convolutional neural networks trained on the raw input images and is therefore a computationally efficient, simple to implement and explainable alternative to deep learning-based approaches."

Accordingly, we aimed to develop a non-invasive quantification software using the heterogeneity scores of thyroid nodules. This cross-sectional study retrospectively enrolled 188 patients who were categorized into four groups according to their diagnostic classification in the Bethesda system and surgical pathology [II-benign (B) (n = 24); III-B (n = 52); III-malignant (M) (n = 54); V/VI-M (n = 58)]. Heterogeneity scores were derived using an image pixel-based heterogeneity index, utilized as a coefficient of variation (CV) value, and analyzed across all US images. Differences in heterogeneity scores were compared using one-way analysis of variance with Tukey’s test. Diagnostic accuracy was determined by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve. The results of this study indicated significant differences in mean heterogeneity scores between benign and malignant thyroid nodules, except in the comparison between III-M and V/VI-M nodules. Among malignant nodules, the Bethesda classification was not observed to be associated with mean heterogeneity scores. Moreover, there was a positive correlation between heterogeneity scores and the combined diagnostic category, which was based on the Bethesda system and surgical cytology grades (R = 0.639, p < 0.001). AUROC for heterogeneity scores showed the highest diagnostic performance (0.818; cut-off: 30.22% CV value) for differentiating the benign group (normal/II-B/III-B) from the malignant group (III-M/V&VI-M), with a diagnostic accuracy of 72.5% (161/122). Quantitative heterogeneity measurement of US images is a valuable non-invasive diagnostic tool for predicting the likelihood of malignancy in thyroid nodules, including AUS or FLUS."

        "abstract": "Due to the complexity of the biomedical domain, the ability to capture semantically meaningful representations of terms in context is a long-standing challenge. Despite important progress in the past years, no evaluation benchmark has been developed to evaluate how well language models represent biomedical concepts according to their corresponding context. Inspired by the Word-in-Context (WiC) benchmark, in which word sense disambiguation is reformulated as a binary classification task, we propose a novel dataset, BioWiC, to evaluate the ability of language models to encode biomedical terms in context. BioWiC comprises 20’156 instances, covering over 7’400 unique biomedical terms, making it the largest WiC dataset in the biomedical domain. We evaluate BioWiC both intrinsically and extrinsically and show that it could be used as a reliable benchmark for evaluating context-dependent embeddings in biomedical corpora. In addition, we conduct several experiments using a variety of discriminative and generative large language models to establish robust baselines that can serve as a foundation for future research."

The objectives of this study were to estimate the sensitivity of pooled-sample testing for the detection of M. hyopneumoniae in tracheal samples and to develop probability of M. hyopneumoniae detection estimates for tracheal samples pooled by 3, 5, and 10. A total of 48 M. hyopneumoniae PCR-positive field samples were pooled 3-, 5-, and 10-times using field M. hyopneumoniae DNA-negative samples and tested in triplicate. The sensitivity was estimated at 0.96 (95% credible interval [Cred. Int.]: 0.93, 0.98) for pools of 3, 0.95 (95% Cred. Int: 0.92, 0.98) for pools of 5, and 0.93 (95% Cred. Int.: 0.89, 0.96) for pools of 10. All pool sizes resulted in PCR-positive if the individual tracheal sample Ct value was < 33. Additionally, there was no significant decrease in the probability of detecting at least one M. hyopneumoniae-infected pig given any pool size (3, 5, or 10) of tracheal swabs. Furthermore, this manuscript applies the probability of detection estimates to various real-life diagnostic testing scenarios. Combining increased total animals sampled with pooling can be a cost-effective tool to maximize the performance of M. hyopneumoniae surveillance programs."

Two-hundred-fifty women who underwent elective fertility preservation at a tertiary center, 2019–2022 were included. Primary outcome was the number of metaphase II oocytes retrieved. Outcome class was based on oocyte count (OC): Low (≤ 8), Medium (9–15) or High (≥ 16). Machine-learning models and statistical regression were used to predict outcome class, first based on pre-treatment parameters, and then using post-treatment data from ovulation-triggering day. OC was 136 Low, 80 Medium, and 34 High. Random Forest Classifier (RFC) was the most accurate model (pre-treatment receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) was 77%, and post-treatment ROC AUC was 87%), followed by XGBoost Classifier (pre-treatment ROC AUC 74%, post-treatment ROC AUC 86%). The most important pre-treatment parameters for RFC were basal FSH (22.6%), basal LH (19.1%), AFC (18.2%), and basal estradiol (15.6%). Post-treatment parameters were estradiol levels on trigger-day (17.7%), basal FSH (11%), basal LH (9%), and AFC (8%). Machine-learning models trained with clinical data appear to predict fertility preservation treatment outcomes with relatively high accuracy."

Although there have been some studies on revealing different risk factors affecting the death of COVID-19 patients, researchers rarely provide a comprehensive analysis to reveal the relationships and interactive effects of the risk factors of COVID-19 mortality, especially in the elderly. Through retrospectively including 1917 COVID-19 patients (102 were dead) admitted to Xiangya Hospital from December 2022 to March 2023, we used the association rule mining method to identify the risk factors leading causes of death among the elderly. Firstly, we used the Affinity Propagation clustering to extract key features from the dataset. Then, we applied the Apriori Algorithm to obtain 6 groups of abnormal feature combinations with significant increments in mortality rate. The results showed a relationship between the number of abnormal feature combinations and mortality rates within different groups. Patients with “C-reactive protein > 8 mg/L”, “neutrophils percentage > 75.0 %”, “lymphocytes percentage < 20%”, and “albumin < 40 g/L” have a 2\\(\\times\\) mortality rate than the basic one. When the characteristics of “D-dimer > 0.5 mg/L” and “WBC > \\(9.5 \\times 10^9\\) /L” are continuously included in this foundation, the mortality rate can be increased to 3\\(\\times\\) or 4\\(\\times\\). In addition, we also found that liver and kidney diseases significantly affect patient mortality, and the mortality rate can be as high as 100%. These findings can support auxiliary diagnosis and treatment to facilitate early intervention in patients, thereby reducing patient mortality."

        "abstract": "The progression of Parkinson’s disease (PD) is heterogeneous across patients, affecting counseling and inflating the number of patients needed to test potential neuroprotective treatments. Moreover, disease subtypes might require different therapies. This work uses a data-driven approach to investigate how observed heterogeneity in PD can be explained by the existence of distinct PD progression subtypes. To derive stable PD progression subtypes in an unbiased manner, we analyzed multimodal longitudinal data from three large PD cohorts and performed extensive cross-cohort validation. A latent time joint mixed-effects model (LTJMM) was used to align patients on a common disease timescale. Progression subtypes were identified by variational deep embedding with recurrence (VaDER). In each cohort, we identified a fast-progressing and a slow-progressing subtype, reflected by different patterns of motor and non-motor symptoms progression, survival rates, treatment response, features extracted from DaTSCAN imaging and digital gait assessments, education, and Alzheimer’s disease pathology. Progression subtypes could be predicted with ROC-AUC up to 0.79 for individual patients when a one-year observation period was used for model training. Simulations demonstrated that enriching clinical trials with fast-progressing patients based on these predictions can reduce the required cohort size by 43%. Our results show that heterogeneity in PD can be explained by two distinct subtypes of PD progression that are stable across cohorts. These subtypes align with the brain-first vs. body-first concept, which potentially provides a biological explanation for subtype differences. Our predictive models will enable clinical trials with significantly lower sample sizes by enriching fast-progressing patients."

The utilization of UHF imaging as a new imaging technique for the 3D-in-vivo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model can facilitate new insights into tissue perfusion and survival. Therefore, human renal cystic tissue was grafted onto the CAM and examined using UHF ultrasound imaging. Due to the unprecedented resolution of UHF ultrasound, it was possible to visualize microvessels, their development, and the formation of anastomoses. This enabled the observation of anastomoses between human and chicken vessels only 12 h after transplantation. These observations were validated by 3D reconstructions from a light sheet microscopy image stack, indocyanine green angiography, and histological analysis. Contrary to the assumption that the nutrient supply of the human cystic tissue and the gas exchange happens through diffusion from CAM vessels, this study shows that the vasculature of the human cystic tissue is directly connected to the blood vessels of the CAM and perfusion is established within a short period. Therefore, this in-vivo model combined with UHF imaging appears to be the ideal platform for studying the effects of intravenously applied therapeutics to inhibit renal cyst growth."

        "abstract": "Only ~20% of heavy drinkers develop alcohol cirrhosis (AC). While differences in metabolism, inflammation, signaling, microbiome signatures and genetic variations have been tied to the pathogenesis of AC, the key underlying mechanisms for this interindividual variability, remain to be fully elucidated. Induced pluripotent stem cell-derived hepatocytes (iHLCs) from patients with AC and healthy controls differ transcriptomically, bioenergetically and histologically. They include a greater number of lipid droplets (LDs) and LD-associated mitochondria compared to control cells. These pre-pathologic indicators are effectively reversed by Aramchol, an inhibitor of stearoyl-CoA desaturase. Bioenergetically, AC iHLCs have lower spare capacity, slower ATP production and their mitochondrial fuel flexibility towards fatty acids and glutamate is weakened. MARC1 and PNPLA3, genes implicated by GWAS in alcohol cirrhosis, show to correlate with lipid droplet-associated and mitochondria-mediated oxidative damage in AC iHLCs. Knockdown of PNPLA3 expression exacerbates mitochondrial deficits and leads to lipid droplets alterations. These findings suggest that differences in mitochondrial bioenergetics and lipid droplet formation are intrinsic to AC hepatocytes and can play a role in its pathogenesis."

Among those who have recovered, many experience negative health effects, particularly influenced by demographic factors such as gender and age, as well as physiological and neurological factors like sleep patterns, emotional states, anxiety, and memory. This research aims to explore various health factors affecting different demographic profiles and establish significant correlations among physiological and neurological factors in the post-COVID-19 state. To achieve these objectives, we have identified the post-COVID-19 health factors and based on these factors survey data were collected from COVID-recovered patients in Bangladesh. Employing diverse machine learning algorithms, we utilised the best prediction model for post-COVID-19 factors. Initial findings from statistical analysis were further validated using Chi-square to demonstrate significant relationships among these elements. Additionally, Pearson’s coefficient was utilized to indicate positive or negative associations among various physiological and neurological factors in the post-COVID-19 state. Finally, we determined the most effective machine learning model and identified key features using analytical methods such as the Gini Index, Feature Coefficients, Information Gain, and SHAP Value Assessment. And found that the Decision Tree model excelled in identifying crucial features while predicting the extent of post-COVID-19 impact."

Prolonged HUA is often associated with hypertension, atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease. Studies have shown that gut microbiota (GM) affect these chronic diseases. This study aimed to determine the relationship between HUA and GM. The microbiome of 224 men and 254 women aged 40 years was analyzed through next-generation sequencing and machine learning. We obtained GM data through 16S rRNA-based sequencing of the fecal samples, finding that alpha-diversity by Shannon index was significantly low in the HUA group. Linear discriminant effect size analysis detected a high abundance of the genera Collinsella and Faecalibacterium in the HUA and non-HUA groups. Based on light gradient boosting machine learning, we propose that HUA can be predicted with high AUC using four clinical characteristics and the relative abundance of nine bacterial genera, including Collinsella and Dorea. In addition, analysis of causal relationships using a direct linear non-Gaussian acyclic model indicated a positive effect of the relative abundance of the genus Collinsella on blood UA levels. Our results suggest abundant Collinsella in the gut can increase blood UA levels."

Upper limb disuse (Fugl-Meyer assessment of upper extremity [FMA-UE], Action Research Arm Test, Motor Activity Log), lower limb disuse (Fugl-Meyer Assessment of lower extremity [FMA-LE]), balance performance (Berg balance scale), and physical inactivity time (International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form [IPAQ-SF]) of 195 stroke patients who visited the Kishiwada Rehabilitation Hospital were assessed at admission. The incidence of post-stroke CRPS was 15.4% in all stroke patients 3 months after admission. The IPAQ, FMA-UE, and FMA-LE were extracted as risk factors for post-stroke CRPS. According to the decision tree algorithm, the incidence of post-stroke CRPS was 1.5% in patients with a short physical inactivity time (IPAQ-SF < 635), while it increased to 84.6% in patients with a long inactivity time (IPAQ-SF ≥ 635) and severe disuse of upper and lower limbs (FMA-UE score < 19.5; FMA-LE score < 16.5). The incidence of post-stroke CRPS may increase with lower-limb disuse and physical inactivity, in addition to upper-limb disuse. Increasing physical activity and addressing lower- and upper-limb motor paralysis may reduce post-stroke CRPS."

Focusing on women aged 35–50, we examined the effectiveness of Tension-free Vaginal Tape (TVT) surgery and Vaginal Erbium Laser (VEL) treatment for over 15 years. The TVT group consisted of 102 patients who underwent surgery using either the Advantage Fit mid-urethral sling system (Boston Scientific Co., MA, USA) or the GYNECARE TVT retropubic system (Ethicon Inc., NJ, USA). The VEL group included 113 patients treated with a non-ablative Erbium: YAG laser (FotonaSmooth™ XS; Fotona d.o.o., Ljubljana, Slovenia), and there were 112 patients in the control group. We constructed a network diagram analyzing the correlations between health, demographic factors, treatment methods, and patient outcomes. By calculating the shortest path using heuristic functions, we identified significant correlations and treatment effects. This approach supports patient decision making by choosing between TVT and VEL treatments based on individual objectives. Our findings provide new insights into SUI treatment, highlighting the value of a data-driven personalized approach for clinical decision-making. This interdisciplinary study bridges the gap between mathematics and medicine, demonstrating the importance of a data-centric approach in clinical decisions."

However, the gap between the collected information and the real-life clinical processes, and the lack of a whole-system perspective, still constitute a relevant limitation. An analytical pipeline was developed to analyse one-year of production data following the patients that came from the ED (n = 49,938) at Uppsala University Hospital (Uppsala, Sweden) by involving clinical experts in all the steps of the analysis. The key internal issues to the ED were the high volume of generic or non-specific diagnoses from non-urgent visits, and the delayed decision regarding hospital admission caused by several imaging assessments and lack of hospital beds. Furthermore, the external pressure of high frequent re-visits of geriatric, psychiatric, and patients with unspecified diagnoses dramatically contributed to the overcrowding. Our work demonstrates that through analysis of production data of the ED patient flow and participation of clinical experts in the pipeline, it was possible to identify systemic issues and directions for solutions. A critical factor was to take a whole systems perspective, as it opened the scope to the boundary effects of inflow and outflow in the whole healthcare system."

Seventy-one participants were included in this study. Cognitive function was assessed by Mini Mental State Examination, muscle strength using dynamometer, body composition using Dual X-ray absorptiometry, respiratory muscle strength using manuvacuometer, and physical function using the Short Physical Performance Battery and Time Up and Go (TUG) tests. Blood samples were collected to analyze a panel of inflammatory biomarkers. The cognitive function was associated with TUG (β = − 0.48; 95%IC = − 0.54 to − 0.21; p < 0.001), inspiratory muscle strength (β = 0.30; 95%IC = 0.005–0.03; p = 0.009), and leptin concentrations (β = 0.32; 95% IC = 0.001–0.006; 0.007). Time spent on TUG test and leptin levels accounted for 27% of variability in cognitive function independent of age. Poorer physical function with leptin plasma levels is associated with decreased cognitive function in older women.

In recent years, convolutional neural network (CNN) has made some achievements in medical image segmentation. However, the convolution operation can only extract features in a fixed size region at a time, which leads to the loss of some key features. The recently popular Transformer has global modeling capabilities, but it does not pay enough attention to local information and cannot accurately segment the edge details of the target area. Given these issues, we proposed dynamic regional attention network (DRA-Net). Different from the above methods, it first measures the similarity of features and concentrates attention on different dynamic regions. In this way, the network can adaptively select different modeling scopes for feature extraction, reducing information loss. Then, regional feature interaction is carried out to better learn local edge details. At the same time, we also design ordered shift multilayer perceptron (MLP) blocks to enhance communication within different regions, further enhancing the network’s ability to learn local edge details. After several experiments, the results indicate that our network produces more accurate segmentation performance compared to other CNN and Transformer based networks."

        "abstract": "The abnormal heart conduction, known as arrhythmia, can contribute to cardiac diseases that carry the risk of fatal consequences. Healthcare professionals typically use electrocardiogram (ECG) signals and certain preliminary tests to identify abnormal patterns in a patient’s cardiac activity. To assess the overall cardiac health condition, cardiac specialists monitor these activities separately. This procedure may be arduous and time-intensive, potentially impacting the patient’s well-being. This study automates and introduces a novel solution for predicting the cardiac health conditions, specifically identifying cardiac morbidity and arrhythmia in patients by using invasive and non-invasive measurements. The experimental analyses conducted in medical studies entail extremely sensitive data and any partial or biased diagnoses in this field are deemed unacceptable. Therefore, this research aims to introduce a new concept of determining the uncertainty level of machine learning algorithms using information entropy. To assess the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms information entropy can be considered as a unique performance evaluator of the machine learning algorithm which is not selected previously any studies within the realm of bio-computational research. This experiment was conducted on arrhythmia and heart disease datasets collected from Massachusetts Institute of Technology-Berth Israel Hospital-arrhythmia (DB-1) and Cleveland Heart Disease (DB-2), respectively. Our framework consists of four significant steps: 1) Data acquisition, 2) Feature preprocessing approach, 3) Implementation of learning algorithms, and 4) Information Entropy. The results demonstrate the average performance in terms of accuracy achieved by the classification algorithms: Neural Network (NN) achieved 99.74%, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) 98.98%, Support Vector Machine (SVM) 99.37%, Random Forest (RF) 99.76 % and Naïve Bayes (NB) 98.66% respectively.

We propose a systematic investigation of the value of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to leverage [\\(^{82}\\)Rb] Silicon PhotoMultiplier (SiPM) PET MPI for MACE prediction. We establish a general pipeline for AI model validation to assess and compare the performance of global (i.e. average of the entire MPI signal), regional (17 segments), radiomics and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models leveraging various MPI signals on a dataset of 234 patients. Results showed that all regional AI models significantly outperformed the global model (\\(p<0.001\\)), where the best AUC of 73.9% (CI 72.5–75.3) was obtained with a CNN model. A regional AI model based on MBF averages from 17 segments fed to a Logistic Regression (LR) constituted an excellent trade-off between model simplicity and performance, achieving an AUC of 73.4% (CI 72.3–74.7). A radiomics model based on intensity features revealed that the global average was the least important feature when compared to other aggregations of the MPI signal over the myocardium. We conclude that AI models can allow better personalized prognosis assessment for MACE."

        "abstract": "To develop and validate a machine learning based algorithm to estimate physical activity (PA) intensity using the smartwatch with the capacity to record PA and determine outdoor state. Two groups of participants, including 24 adults (13 males) and 18 children (9 boys), completed a sequential activity trial. During each trial, participants wore a smartwatch, and energy expenditure was measured using indirect calorimetry as gold standard. The support vector machine algorithm and the least squares regression model were applied for the metabolic equivalent (MET) estimation using raw data derived from the smartwatch. Exercise intensity was categorized based on MET values into sedentary activity (SED), light activity (LPA), moderate activity (MPA), and vigorous activity (VPA). The classification accuracy was evaluated using area under the ROC curve (AUC). The METs estimation accuracy were assessed via the mean absolute error (MAE), the correlation coefficient, Bland–Altman plots, and intraclass correlation (ICC). A total of 24 adults aged 21–34 years and 18 children aged 9–13 years participated in the study, yielding 1790 and 1246 data points for adults and children respectively for model building and validation. For adults, the AUC for classifying SED, MVPA, and VPA were 0.96, 0.88, and 0.86, respectively. The MAE between true METs and estimated METs was 0.75 METs. The correlation coefficient and ICC were 0.87 (p < 0.001) and 0.89, respectively. For children, comparable levels of accuracy were demonstrated, with the AUC for SED, MVPA, and VPA being 0.98, 0.89, and 0.85, respectively. The MAE between true METs and estimated METs was 0.80 METs. The correlation coefficient and ICC were 0.79 (p < 0.001) and 0.84, respectively. The developed model successfully estimated PA intensity with high accuracy in both adults and children. The application of this model enables independent investigation of PA intensity, facilitating research in health monitoring and potentially in areas such as myopia prevention and control."

This study explores how integrating domain knowledge with large language models (LLMs)—capable of sophisticated text interpretation and generation—can reduce these errors. We introduce MEDIC (medication direction copilot), a system that emulates the reasoning of pharmacists by prioritizing precise communication of core clinical components of a prescription, such as dosage and frequency. It fine-tunes a first-generation LLM using 1,000 expert-annotated and augmented directions from Amazon Pharmacy to extract the core components and assembles them into complete directions using pharmacy logic and safety guardrails. We compared MEDIC against two LLM-based benchmarks: one leveraging 1.5 million medication directions and the other using state-of-the-art LLMs. On 1,200 expert-reviewed prescriptions, the two benchmarks respectively recorded 1.51 (confidence interval (CI) 1.03, 2.31) and 4.38 (CI 3.13, 6.64) times more near-miss events—errors caught and corrected before reaching the patient—than MEDIC. Additionally, we tested MEDIC by deploying within the production system of an online pharmacy, and during this experimental period, it reduced near-miss events by 33% (CI 26%, 40%). This study shows that LLMs, with domain expertise and safeguards, improve the accuracy and efficiency of pharmacy operations."

This study intends to investigate the gut microbiome of Bengali people as well as several indigenous ethnicities (Chakma, Marma, Khyang, and Tripura) residing in the Chittagong Hill Tracts areas of Bangladesh. Following fecal sample collection from each population, part of the bacterial 16 s rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced using Illumina NovaSeq platform. Our findings indicated that Bangladeshi gut microbiota have a distinct diversity profile when compared to other countries. We also found out that Bangladeshi indigenous communities had a higher Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio than the Bengali population. The investigation revealed an unclassified bacterium that was differentially abundant in Bengali samples while the genus Alistipes was found to be prevalent in Chakma samples. Further research on these bacteria might help understand diseases associated with these populations. Also, the current small sample-sized pilot study hindered the comprehensive understanding of the gut microbial diversity of the Bangladeshi population and its potential health implications. However, our study will help establish a basic understanding of the gut microbiome of the Bangladeshi population."

Fluoroscopic images pose a radiation risk to operating room staff, scrubbed personnel, and the patient. Most commonly, a Standard Fluoroscope with an Image Intensifier is used. Our institution recently implemented the novel Fluoroscope with a Flat Panel Detector. The purpose of this study was to compare radiation dosage and accuracy between the two fluoroscopes. A retrospective review of a consecutive series of patients who underwent Periacetabular Osteotomy for symptomatic hip dysplasia was completed. The total radiation exposure dose (mGy) was recorded and compared for each case from the standard fluoroscope (n = 27) and the flat panel detector (n = 26) cohorts. Lateral center edge angle was measured and compared intraoperatively and at the six-week postoperative visit. A total of 53 patients (96% female) with a mean age and BMI of 17.84 (± 6.84) years and 22.66 (± 4.49) kg/m2 (standard fluoroscope) and 18.23 (± 4.21) years and 21.99 (± 4.00) kg/m2 (flat panel detector) were included. The standard fluoroscope averaged total radiation exposure to be 410.61(± 193.02) mGy, while the flat panel detector averaged 91.12 (± 49.64) mGy (p < 0.0001). The average difference (bias) between intraoperative and 6-week postoperative lateral center edge angle measurement was 0.36° (limits of agreement: − 3.19 to 2.47°) for the standard fluoroscope and 0.27° (limits of agreement: − 2.05 to 2.59°) for the flat panel detector cohort. Use of fluoroscopy with flat panel detector technology decreased the total radiation dose exposure intraoperatively and produced an equivalent assessment of intraoperative lateral center edge angle. Decreasing radiation exposure to young patients is imperative to reduce the risk of future comorbidities."

The effectiveness of the disease’s therapy is significantly impacted by early identification of this illness. Preprocessing is the initial detecting stage in enhancing the quality of skin images by removing undesired background noise and objects. This study aims is to compile preprocessing techniques for skin cancer imaging that are currently accessible. Researchers looking into automated skin cancer diagnosis might use this article as an excellent place to start. The fully convolutional encoder–decoder network and Sparrow search algorithm (FCEDN-SpaSA) are proposed in this study for the segmentation of dermoscopic images. The individual wolf method and the ensemble ghosting technique are integrated to generate a neighbour-based search strategy in SpaSA for stressing the correct balance between navigation and exploitation. The classification procedure is accomplished by using an adaptive CNN technique to discriminate between normal skin and malignant skin lesions suggestive of disease. Our method provides classification accuracies comparable to commonly used incremental learning techniques while using less energy, storage space, memory access, and training time (only network updates with new training samples, no network sharing). In a simulation, the segmentation performance of the proposed technique on the ISBI 2017, ISIC 2018, and PH2 datasets reached accuracies of 95.28%, 95.89%, 92.70%, and 98.78%, respectively, on the same dataset and assessed the classification performance.

In this article, we analyzed the molecular action network driving the emergence of this event. Two datasets (GSE113439 and GSE147507) from the GEO database were used for the identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs).Common DEGs were selected by VennDiagram and their enrichment in biological pathways was analyzed. Candidate gene biomarkers were selected using three different machine-learning algorithms (SVM-RFE, LASSO, RF).The diagnostic efficacy of these foundational genes was validated using independent datasets. Eventually, we validated molecular docking and medication prediction. We found 62 common DEGs, including several ones that could be enriched for Immune Response and Inflammation. Two DEGs (SELE and CCL20) could be identified by machine-learning algorithms. They performed well in diagnostic tests on independent datasets. In particular, we observed an upregulation of functions associated with the adaptive immune response, the leukocyte-lymphocyte-driven immunological response, and the proinflammatory response. Moreover, by ssGSEA, natural killer T cells, activated dendritic cells, activated CD4 T cells, neutrophils, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells were correlated with COVID-19 and PH, with SELE and CCL20 showing the strongest correlation with dendritic cells. Potential therapeutic compounds like FENRETI-NIDE, AFLATOXIN B1 and 1-nitropyrene were predicted. Further molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations showed that 1-nitropyrene had the most stable binding with SELE and CCL20.The findings indicated that SELE and CCL20 were identified as novel diagnostic biomarkers for COVID-19 complicated with PH, and the target of these two key genes, FENRETI-NIDE and 1-nitropyrene, was predicted to be a potential therapeutic target, thus providing new insights into the prediction and treatment of COVID-19 complicated with PH in clinical practice."

Accurate diagnosis through traditional slide-based analysis is difficult, necessitating a standardized objective technique. Over the past two decades, imaging flow cytometry (IFC) has proven effective in combining image-based morphometric analyses with high-parameter phenotyping. We have previously demonstrated the effectiveness of combining IFC with a feature-based machine learning algorithm to accurately identify and quantify rare binucleated erythroblasts (BNEs) in dyserythropoietic BM cells. However, a feature-based workflow poses challenges requiring software-specific expertise. Here we employ a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm for BNE identification and differentiation from doublets and cells with irregular nuclear morphology in IFC data. We demonstrate that this simplified AI workflow, coupled with a powerful CNN algorithm, achieves comparable BNE quantification accuracy to manual and feature-based analysis with substantial time savings, eliminating workflow complexity. This streamlined approach holds significant clinical value, enhancing IFC accessibility for routine diagnostic purposes."

Yet, the degree to which multiple co-occurring sensory impairments (MSI across vision, proprioception, vestibular function, olfactory, and hearing) are associated with brain morphometry remain unexplored. Data were from 208 cognitively unimpaired participants (mean age 72 ± 10 years; 59% women) enrolled in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. Multiple linear regression models were used to estimate cross-sectional associations between MSI and regional brain imaging volumes. For each additional sensory impairment, there were associated lower orbitofrontal gyrus and entorhinal cortex volumes but higher caudate and putamen volumes. Participants with MSI had lower mean volumes in the superior frontal gyrus, orbitofrontal gyrus, superior parietal lobe, and precuneus compared to participants with < 2 impairments. While MSI was largely associated with lower brain volumes, our results suggest the possibility that MSI was associated with higher basal ganglia volumes. Longitudinal analyses are needed to evaluate the temporality and directionality of these associations."

While these tools accurately predict elevated depression symptoms in small, homogenous populations, recent studies show that these tools are less accurate in larger, more diverse populations. In this work, we show that accuracy is reduced because sensed-behaviors are unreliable predictors of depression across individuals: sensed-behaviors that predict depression risk are inconsistent across demographic and socioeconomic subgroups. We first identified subgroups where a developed AI tool underperformed by measuring algorithmic bias, where subgroups with depression were incorrectly predicted to be at lower risk than healthier subgroups. We then found inconsistencies between sensed-behaviors predictive of depression across these subgroups. Our findings suggest that researchers developing AI tools predicting mental health from sensed-behaviors should think critically about the generalizability of these tools, and consider tailored solutions for targeted populations."

        "abstract": "Vitiligo is a hypopigmented skin disease characterized by the loss of melanin. The progressive nature and widespread incidence of vitiligo necessitate timely and accurate detection. Usually, a single diagnostic test often falls short of providing definitive confirmation of the condition, necessitating the assessment by dermatologists who specialize in vitiligo. However, the current scarcity of such specialized medical professionals presents a significant challenge. To mitigate this issue and enhance diagnostic accuracy, it is essential to build deep learning models that can support and expedite the detection process. This study endeavors to establish a deep learning framework to enhance the diagnostic accuracy of vitiligo. To this end, a comparative analysis of five models including ResNet (ResNet34, ResNet50, and ResNet101 models) and Swin Transformer series (Swin Transformer Base, and Swin Transformer Large models), were conducted under the uniform condition to identify the model with superior classification capabilities. Moreover, the study sought to augment the interpretability of these models by selecting one that not only provides accurate diagnostic outcomes but also offers visual cues highlighting the regions pertinent to vitiligo. The empirical findings reveal that the Swin Transformer Large model achieved the best performance in classification, whose AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity are 0.94, 93.82%, 94.02%, and 93.5%, respectively. In terms of interpretability, the highlighted regions in the class activation map correspond to the lesion regions of the vitiligo images, which shows that it effectively indicates the specific category regions associated with the decision-making of dermatological diagnosis. Additionally, the visualization of feature maps generated in the middle layer of the deep learning model provides insights into the internal mechanisms of the model, which is valuable for improving the interpretability of the model, tuning performance, and enhancing clinical applicability. The outcomes of this study underscore the significant potential of deep learning models to revolutionize medical diagnosis by improving diagnostic accuracy and operational efficiency. The research highlights the necessity for ongoing exploration in this domain to fully leverage the capabilities of deep learning technologies in medical diagnostics."

A total of 5642 weighted samples of young girls from the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey dataset were utilized. The data underwent preprocessing, with 80% of the observations used for training the model and 20% for testing. Eight machine learning algorithms were employed to build and compare models. The model performance was assessed using evaluation metrics in Python software. Various data balancing techniques were applied, and the Boruta algorithm was used to select the most relevant features. Besides, association rule mining was conducted using the Apriori algorithm in R software. The random forest classifier with an AUC value of 82% outperformed in predicting anemia among all the tested classifiers. Region, poor wealth index, no formal education, unimproved toilet facility, rural residence, not used contraceptive method, religion, age, no media exposure, occupation, and having more than 5 family size were the top attributes to predict anemia. Association rule mining was identified the top seven best rules that most frequently associated with anemia. The random forest classifier is the best for predicting anemia.

Although the use of detailed oculomotor parameters in clinical research has been limited due to the scalability of the required equipment, the development of novel tablet-based technologies has created opportunities for fast, easy, cost-effective, and reliable eye tracking. Oculomotor measures captured via a mobile tablet-based technology have previously been shown to reliably discriminate between Parkinson’s Disease (PD) patients and healthy controls. Here we further investigate the use of oculomotor measures from tablet-based eye-tracking to inform on various cognitive abilities and disease severity in PD patients. When combined using partial least square regression, the extracted oculomotor parameters can explain up to 71% of the variance in cognitive test scores (e.g. Trail Making Test). Moreover, using a receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis we show that eye-tracking parameters can be used in a support vector classifier to discriminate between individuals with mild PD from those with moderate PD (based on UPDRS cut-off scores) with an accuracy of 90%. Taken together, our findings highlight the potential usefulness of mobile tablet-based technology to rapidly scale eye-tracking use and usefulness in both research and clinical settings by informing on disease stage and cognitive outcomes."

        "abstract": "Using machine learning methods to analyze the fatigue status of medical security personnel and the factors influencing fatigue (such as BMI, gender, and wearing protective clothing working hours), with the goal of identifying the key factors contributing to fatigue. By validating the predicted outcomes, actionable and practical recommendations can be offered to enhance fatigue status, such as reducing wearing protective clothing working hours. A questionnaire was designed to assess the fatigue status of medical security personnel during the closed-loop period, aiming to capture information on fatigue experienced during work and disease recovery. The collected data was then preprocessed and used to determine the structural parameters for each machine learning algorithm. To evaluate the prediction performance of different models, the mean relative error (MRE) and goodness of fit (R2) between the true and predicted values were calculated. Furthermore, the importance rankings of various parameters in relation to fatigue status were determined using the RF feature importance analysis method. The fatigue status of medical security personnel during the closed-loop period was analyzed using multiple machine learning methods. The prediction performance of these methods was ranked from highest to lowest as follows: Gradient Boosting Regression (GBM) > Random Forest (RF) > Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) > K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) > Support Vector Regression (SVR). Among these algorithms, four out of the five achieved good prediction results, with the GBM method performing the best. The five most critical parameters influencing fatigue status were identified as working hours in protective clothing, a customized symptom and disease score (CSDS), physical exercise, body mass index (BMI), and age, all of which had importance scores exceeding 0.06. Notably, working hours in protective clothing obtained the highest importance score of 0.54, making it the most critical factor impacting fatigue status. Fatigue is a prevalent and pressing issue among medical security personnel operating in closed-loop environments. In our investigation, we observed that the GBM method exhibited superior predictive performance in determining the fatigue status of medical security personnel during the closed-loop period, surpassing other machine learning techniques. Notably, our analysis identified several critical factors influencing the fatigue status of medical security personnel, including the duration of working hours in protective clothing, CSDS, and engagement in physical exercise. These findings shed light on the multifaceted nature of fatigue among healthcare workers and emphasize the importance of considering various contributing factors. To effectively alleviate fatigue, prudent management of working hours for security personnel, along with minimizing the duration of wearing protective clothing, proves to be promising strategies. Furthermore, promoting regular physical exercise among medical security personnel can significantly impact fatigue reduction. Additionally, the exploration of medication interventions and the adoption of innovative protective clothing options present potential avenues for mitigating fatigue. The insights derived from this study offer valuable guidance to management personnel involved in organizing large-scale events, enabling them to make informed decisions and implement targeted interventions to address fatigue among medical security personnel. In our upcoming research, we will further expand the fatigue dataset while considering higher precisionprediction algorithms, such as XGBoost model, ensemble model, etc., and explore their potential contributions to our research."

We utilized claims data from the Komodo Healthcare Map database to develop a machine-learning model to identify potential HoFH patients. We tokenized patients enrolled in MyRARE (patient support program for those prescribed evinacumab-dgnb in the United States) and linked them with their Komodo claims. A true positive HoFH cohort (n = 331) was formed by including patients from MyRARE and patients with prescriptions for evinacumab-dgnb or lomitapide. The negative cohort (n = 1423) comprised patients with or at risk for cardiovascular disease. We divided the cohort into an 80% training and 20% testing set. Overall, 10,616 candidate features were investigated; 87 were selected due to clinical relevance and importance on prediction performance. Different machine-learning algorithms were explored, with fast interpretable greedy-tree sums selected as the final machine-learning tool. This selection was based on its satisfactory performance and its easily interpretable nature. The model identified four useful features and yielded precision (positive predicted value) of 0.98, recall (sensitivity) of 0.88, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.98, and accuracy of 0.97. The model performed well in identifying HoFH patients in the testing set, providing a useful tool to facilitate HoFH screening and diagnosis via healthcare claims data."

In addition to individual subject information obtained through surveys and physical examinations, a comprehensive neuroimaging battery consisting of multiple modalities provides imaging-derived phenotypes (IDPs) that can serve as biomarkers in neuroscience research. In this study, we augment the existing set of UK Biobank neuroimaging structural IDPs, obtained from well-established software libraries such as FSL and FreeSurfer, with related measurements acquired through the Advanced Normalization Tools Ecosystem. This includes previously established cortical and subcortical measurements defined, in part, based on the Desikan-Killiany-Tourville atlas. Also included are morphological measurements from two recent developments: medial temporal lobe parcellation of hippocampal and extra-hippocampal regions in addition to cerebellum parcellation and thickness based on the Schmahmann anatomical labeling. Through predictive modeling, we assess the clinical utility of these IDP measurements, individually and in combination, using commonly studied phenotypic correlates including age, fluid intelligence, numeric memory, and several other sociodemographic variables. The predictive accuracy of these IDP-based models, in terms of root-mean-squared-error or area-under-the-curve for continuous and categorical variables, respectively, provides comparative insights between software libraries as well as potential clinical interpretability. Results demonstrate varied performance between package-based IDP sets and their combination, emphasizing the need for careful consideration in their selection and utilization."

        "abstract": "Health and disease are fundamentally influenced by microbial communities and their genes (the microbiome). An in-depth analysis of microbiome structure that enables the classification of individuals based on their health can be crucial in enhancing diagnostics and treatment strategies to improve the overall well-being of an individual. In this paper, we present a novel semi-supervised methodology known as Randomized Feature Selection based Latent Dirichlet Allocation (RFSLDA) to study the impact of the gut microbiome on a subject’s health status. Since the data in our study consists of fuzzy health labels, which are self-reported, traditional supervised learning approaches may not be suitable. As a first step, based on the similarity between documents in text analysis and gut-microbiome data, we employ Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a topic modeling approach which uses microbiome counts as features to group subjects into relatively homogeneous clusters, without invoking any knowledge of observed health status (labels) of subjects. We then leverage information from the observed health status of subjects to associate these clusters with the most similar health status making it a semi-supervised approach. Finally, a feature selection technique is incorporated into the model to improve the overall classification performance. The proposed method provides a semi-supervised topic modelling approach that can help handle the high dimensionality of the microbiome data in association studies. Our experiments reveal that our semi-supervised classification algorithm is effective and efficient in terms of high classification accuracy compared to popular supervised learning approaches like SVM and multinomial logistic model. The RFSLDA framework is attractive because it (i) enhances clustering accuracy by identifying key bacteria types as indicators of health status, (ii) identifies key bacteria types within each group based on estimates of the proportion of bacteria types within the groups, and (iii) computes a measure of within-group similarity to identify highly similar subjects in terms of their health status."

We previously estimated that human genetic evidence doubles the success rate from clinical development to approval5. In this study we leverage the growth in genetic evidence over the past decade to better understand the characteristics that distinguish clinical success and failure. We estimate the probability of success for drug mechanisms with genetic support is 2.6 times greater than those without. This relative success varies among therapy areas and development phases, and improves with increasing confidence in the causal gene, but is largely unaffected by genetic effect size, minor allele frequency or year of discovery. These results indicate we are far from reaching peak genetic insights to aid the discovery of targets for more effective drugs."

This is treatable, and by enabling the factor for happening, the factor for dissolving the dead tissues. If the brain tumor glioblastoma is untreated, the child will go to death; to avoid this, the child has to treat the brain problem using the scan of MRI images. Using the neural network, brain-related difficulties have to be resolved. It is identified to make the diagnosis of glioblastoma. This research deals with the techniques of max rationalizing and min rationalizing images, and the method of boosted division time attribute extraction has been involved in diagnosing glioblastoma. The process of maximum and min rationalization is used to recognize the Brain tumor glioblastoma in the brain images for treatment efficiency. The image segment is created for image recognition. The method of boosted division time attribute extraction is used in image recognition with the help of MRI for image extraction. The proposed boosted division time attribute extraction method helps to recognize the fetal images and find Brain tumor glioblastoma with feasible accuracy using image rationalization against the brain tumor glioblastoma diagnosis. In addition, 45% of adults are affected by the tumor, 40% of children and 5% are in death situations. To reduce this ratio, in this study, the Brain tumor glioblastoma is identified and segmented to recognize the fetal images and find the Brain tumor glioblastoma diagnosis. Then the tumor grades were analyzed using the efficient method for the imaging MRI with the diagnosis result of partially high. The accuracy of the proposed TAE-PIS system is 98.12% which is higher when compared to other methods like Genetic algorithm, Convolution neural network, fuzzy-based minimum and maximum neural network and kernel-based support vector machine respectively. Experimental results show that the proposed method archives rate of 98.12% accuracy with low response time and compared with the Genetic algorithm (GA), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), fuzzy-based minimum and maximum neural network (Fuzzy min–max NN), and kernel-based support vector machine. Specifically, the proposed method achieves a substantial improvement of 80.82%, 82.13%, 85.61%, and 87.03% compared to GA, CNN, Fuzzy min–max NN, and kernel-based support vector machine, respectively."

        "abstract": "Meniscal injury represents a common type of knee injury, accounting for over 50% of all knee injuries. The clinical diagnosis and treatment of meniscal injury heavily rely on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, accurately diagnosing the meniscus from a comprehensive knee MRI is challenging due to its limited and weak signal, significantly impeding the precise grading of meniscal injuries. In this study, a visual interpretable fine grading (VIFG) diagnosis model has been developed to facilitate intelligent and quantified grading of meniscal injuries. Leveraging a multilevel transfer learning framework, it extracts comprehensive features and incorporates an attributional attention module to precisely locate the injured positions. Moreover, the attention-enhancing feedback module effectively concentrates on and distinguishes regions with similar grades of injury. The proposed method underwent validation on FastMRI_Knee and Xijing_Knee dataset, achieving mean grading accuracies of 0.8631 and 0.8502, surpassing the state-of-the-art grading methods notably in error-prone Grade 1 and Grade 2 cases. Additionally, the visually interpretable heatmaps generated by VIFG provide accurate depictions of actual or potential meniscus injury areas beyond human visual capability. Building upon this, a novel fine grading criterion was introduced for subtypes of meniscal injury, further classifying Grade 2 into 2a, 2b, and 2c, aligning with the anatomical knowledge of meniscal blood supply. It can provide enhanced injury-specific details, facilitating the development of more precise surgical strategies. The efficacy of this subtype classification was evidenced in 20 arthroscopic cases, underscoring the potential enhancement brought by intelligent-assisted diagnosis and treatment for meniscal injuries."

This study evaluated a hemorrhage model on 18 human subjects, comparing the performance of traditional vital signs to multiple off-the-shelf non-invasive biomarkers. A validated lower body negative pressure (LBNP) model was used to induce progression towards hypovolemic cardiovascular instability. Traditional vital signs included mean arterial pressure (MAP), electrocardiography (ECG), plethysmography (Pleth), and the test systems utilized electrical impedance via commercial electrical impedance tomography (EIT) and multifrequency electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) devices. Absolute and relative metrics were used to evaluate the performance in addition to machine learning-based modeling. Relative EIT-based metrics measured on the thorax outperformed vital sign metrics (MAP, ECG, and Pleth) achieving an area-under-the-curve (AUC) of 0.99 (CI 0.95–1.00, 100% sensitivity, 87.5% specificity) at the smallest LBNP change (0–15 mmHg). The best vital sign metric (MAP) at this LBNP change yielded an AUC of 0.6 (CI 0.38–0.79, 100% sensitivity, 25% specificity). Out-of-sample predictive performance from machine learning models were strong, especially when combining signals from multiple technologies simultaneously. EIT, alone or in machine learning-based combination, appears promising as a technology for early detection of progression toward hemodynamic instability."

We found that seasonal vaccination increases pH1N1 specific antibodies and FcR effector functions. Furthermore, prospective baseline antibody profiles after seasonal vaccination, prior to pH1N1 infection, show that unvaccinated uninfected children have elevated ADCC effector function, FcγR3a and FcγR2a binding antibodies to multiple pH1N1 proteins, past seasonal and avian (H5, H7 and H9) strains. Whereas, children that became pH1N1 infected after seasonal vaccination have antibodies focussed to seasonal strains without FcR functions, and greater aggregated HA-specific profiles for IgM and IgG3. Modeling to predict infection susceptibility, ranked baseline hemagglutination antibody inhibition as the highest contributor to lack of pH1N1 infection, in combination with features that include pH1-IgG1, H1-stem responses and FcR binding to seasonal vaccine and pH1 proteins. Thus, seasonal vaccination can have benefits against pandemic influenza viruses, and some children already have broadly reactive antibodies with Fc potential without vaccination and may be considered ‘elite influenza controllers’."

We identified 292 cases (1978–2021) and 42 outbreaks in Piauí and Maranhão states, Brazil, the largest series outside the US/Mexico epidemic zone. The male-to-female ratio was 57.4:1 and the most common activity was armadillo hunting (91.1%) 4 to 30 days before symptom onset. Most patients (92.8%) exhibited typical acute pulmonary disease, with cough (93%), fever (90%), and chest pain (77%) as predominant symptoms. The case fatality rate was 8%. Our negative binomial regression model indicates that reduced precipitation levels in the current (p = 0.015) and preceding year (p = 0.001) predict heightened incidence. Unlike other hotspots, acidic soil characterizes this region. Brazilian strains differ genomically from other C. posadasii lineages. Northeastern Brazil presents a distinctive coccidioidomycosis profile, with armadillo hunters facing elevated risks. Low annual rainfall emerges as a key factor in increasing cases.

Using a sample of 1295 women who gave birth in the last six months and were 18+ years old, recruited through hospital announcements, social media, and professional organizations, we explore ChatGPT’s and ADA’s potential to screen for CB-PTSD by analyzing maternal childbirth narratives. The PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5; cutoff 31) was used to assess CB-PTSD. By developing an ML model that utilizes numerical vector representation of the ADA model, we identify CB-PTSD via narrative classification. Our model outperformed (F1 score: 0.81) ChatGPT and six previously published large text-embedding models trained on mental health or clinical domains data, suggesting that the ADA model can be harnessed to identify CB-PTSD.

We retrospectively recruited 193 patients for this study. The lumbar spine radiographs included anteroposterior, lateral, and bilateral (left and right) oblique views. We cut each lumbar spine radiograph image into a square shape that included the vertebra corresponding to the level at which the TFESI was performed and the vertebrae juxta below and above that level. Output data were divided into “favorable outcome” (≥ 50% reduction in the numeric rating scale [NRS] score at 2 months post-TFESI) and “poor outcome” (< 50% reduction in the NRS score at 2 months post-TFESI). Using these input and output data, we developed a CNN model for predicting TFESI outcomes. The area under the curve of our model was 0.920. Its accuracy was 87.2%.

The data set was divided into training, validation and test sets (75%, 10%, 15% of the data, respectively). An ensemble of DNNs was trained and saliency maps were generated using Guided-Backprob. OCT-scans were also transformed into a one-dimensional-value using t-SNE analysis. The DNNs’ receiver-operating-characteristics on the test set showed a high performance for no-ERM, small-ERM and large-ERM cases (AUC: 0.99, 0.92, 0.99, respectively; 3-way accuracy: 89%), with small-ERMs being the most difficult ones to detect. t-SNE analysis sorted cases by size and, in particular, revealed increased classification uncertainty at the transitions between groups. Saliency maps reliably highlighted ERM, regardless of the presence of other OCT features (i.e. retinal-thickening, intraretinal pseudo-cysts, epiretinal-proliferation) and entities such as ERM-retinoschisis, macular-pseudohole and lamellar-macular-hole. This study showed therefore that DNNs can reliably detect and grade ERMs according to their size not only in the fovea but also in the paracentral region. This is also achieved in cases of hard-to-detect, small-ERMs. In addition, the generated saliency maps can be used to highlight small-ERMs that might otherwise be missed. The proposed model could be used for screening-programs or decision-support-systems in the future."

        "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was considered a major public health burden worldwide. Multiple studies have shown that susceptibility to severe infections and the development of long-term symptoms is significantly influenced by viral and host factors. These findings have highlighted the potential of host genetic markers to identify high-risk individuals and develop target interventions to reduce morbimortality. Despite its importance, genetic host factors remain largely understudied in Latin-American populations. Using a case–control design and a custom next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel encompassing 81 genetic variants and 74 genes previously associated with COVID-19 severity and long-COVID, we analyzed 56 individuals with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 and 56 severe and critical cases. In agreement with previous studies, our results support the association between several clinical variables, including male sex, obesity and common symptoms like cough and dyspnea, and severe COVID-19. Remarkably, thirteen genetic variants showed an association with COVID-19 severity. Among these variants, rs11385942 (p < 0.01; OR = 10.88; 95% CI = 1.36–86.51) located in the LZTFL1 gene, and rs35775079 (p = 0.02; OR = 8.53; 95% CI = 1.05–69.45) located in CCR3 showed the strongest associations. Various respiratory and systemic symptoms, along with the rs8178521 variant (p < 0.01; OR = 2.51; 95% CI = 1.27–4.94) in the IL10RB gene, were significantly associated with the presence of long-COVID. The results of the predictive model comparison showed that the mixed model, which incorporates genetic and non-genetic variables, outperforms clinical and genetic models. To our knowledge, this is the first study in Colombia and Latin-America proposing a predictive model for COVID-19 severity and long-COVID based on genomic analysis. Our study highlights the usefulness of genomic approaches to studying host genetic risk factors in specific populations. The methodology used allowed us to validate several genetic variants previously associated with COVID-19 severity and long-COVID. Finally, the integrated model illustrates the importance of considering genetic factors in precision medicine of infectious diseases."

This study aimed to verify the association between quantified complexity of upper and lower-limb movements at term-equivalent age and motor development in very-preterm or very-low-birth-weight infants. Video images of spontaneous movements at term-equivalent age were collected from very-preterm or very-low-birth-weight infants. A pretrained pose-estimation model and sample entropy (SE) quantified the complexity of the upper- and lower-limb movements. Motor development was evaluated at 9 months of corrected age using Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition. The SE measures were compared between infants with and without motor developmental delay (MDD). Among 90 infants, 11 exhibited MDD. SE measures at most of the upper and lower limbs were significantly reduced in infants with MDD compared to those without MDD (p < 0.05). Composite scores in the motor domain showed significant positive correlations with SE measures at most upper and lower limbs (p < 0.05). The results show that limb-movement complexity at term-equivalent age is reduced in infants with MDD at 9 months of corrected age. SE of limb movements can be a potentially useful kinematic parameter to detect high-risk infants for MDD."

Here, we demonstrate the potent antileukemic activity of the MDM2 antagonist idasanutlin in high-risk and relapsed ex vivo coculture models of TP53 wildtype ALL (n = 40). Insufficient clinical responses to monotherapy MDM2 inhibitors in other cancers prompted us to explore optimal drugs for combination therapy. Utilizing high-throughput combination screening of 1971 FDA-approved and clinically advanced compounds, we identified BCL-xL/BCL-2 inhibitor navitoclax as the most promising idasanutlin combination partner. The idasanutlin-navitoclax combination was synergistically lethal to prognostically-poor, primary-derived and primary patient blasts in ex vivo coculture, and reduced leukemia burden in two very high-risk ALL xenograft models at drug concentrations safely attained in patients; in fact, the navitoclax plasma concentrations were equivalent to those attained in contemporary “low-dose” navitoclax clinical trials. We demonstrate a preferential engagement of cell death over G1 cell cycle arrest, mechanistically implicating MCL-1-binding pro-apoptotic sensitizer NOXA. The proposed combination of two clinical-stage compounds independently under clinical evaluation for ALL is of high clinical relevance and warrants consideration for the treatment of patients with high-risk and relapsed ALL."

        "abstract": "We aim to develop machine learning (ML) models for predicting the complexity and mortality of polytrauma patients using clinical features, including physician diagnoses and physiological data. We conducted a retrospective analysis of a cohort comprising 756 polytrauma patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at Pizhou People’s Hospital Trauma Center, Jiangsu, China between 2020 and 2022. Clinical parameters encompassed demographics, vital signs, laboratory values, clinical scores and physician diagnoses. The two primary outcomes considered were mortality and complexity. We developed ML models to predict polytrauma mortality or complexity using four ML algorithms, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). We assessed the models’ performance and compared the optimal ML model against three existing trauma evaluation scores, including Injury Severity Score (ISS), Trauma Index (TI) and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). In addition, we identified several important clinical predictors that made contributions to the prognostic models. The XGBoost-based polytrauma mortality prediction model demonstrated a predictive ability with an accuracy of 90% and an F-score of 88%, outperforming SVM, RF and ANN models. In comparison to conventional scoring systems, the XGBoost model had substantial improvements in predicting the mortality of polytrauma patients. External validation yielded strong stability and generalization with an accuracy of up to 91% and an AUC of 82%. To predict polytrauma complexity, the XGBoost model maintained its performance over other models and scoring systems with good calibration and discrimination abilities. Feature importance analysis highlighted several clinical predictors of polytrauma complexity and mortality, such as Intracranial hematoma (ICH). Leveraging ML algorithms in polytrauma care can enhance the prognostic estimation of polytrauma patients. This approach may have potential value in the management of polytrauma patients."

        "abstract": "When integrating AI tools in healthcare settings, complex interactions between technologies and primary users are not always fully understood or visible. This deficient and ambiguous understanding hampers attempts by healthcare organizations to adopt AI/ML, and it also creates new challenges for researchers to identify opportunities for simplifying adoption and developing best practices for the use of AI-based solutions. Our study fills this gap by documenting the process of designing, building, and maintaining an AI solution called SepsisWatch at Duke University Health System. We conducted 20 interviews with the team of engineers and scientists that led the multi-year effort to build the tool, integrate it into practice, and maintain the solution. This “Algorithm Journey Map” enumerates all social and technical activities throughout the AI solution’s procurement, development, integration, and full lifecycle management. In addition to mapping the “who?” and “what?” of the adoption of the AI tool, we also show several ‘lessons learned’ throughout the algorithm journey maps including modeling assumptions, stakeholder inclusion, and organizational structure. In doing so, we identify generalizable insights about how to recognize and navigate barriers to AI/ML adoption in healthcare settings. We expect that this effort will further the development of best practices for operationalizing and sustaining ethical principles—in algorithmic systems."

Here, we investigate whether imCMS calls generated from whole slide histopathology images (WSIs) of rectal cancer (RC) pre-treatment biopsies are associated with pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant long course chemoradiotherapy (LCRT) with single agent fluoropyrimidine. DL models were trained to classify WSIs of colorectal cancers stained with hematoxylin and eosin into one of the four CMS classes using a multi-centric dataset of resection and biopsy specimens (n = 1057 WSIs) with paired transcriptional data. Classifiers were tested on a held out RC biopsy cohort (ARISTOTLE) and correlated with pCR to LCRT in an independent dataset merging two RC cohorts (ARISTOTLE, n = 114 and SALZBURG, n = 55 patients). DL models predicted CMS with high classification performance in multiple comparative analyses. In the independent cohorts (ARISTOTLE, SALZBURG), cases with WSIs classified as imCMS1 had a significantly higher likelihood of achieving pCR (OR = 2.69, 95% CI 1.01–7.17, p = 0.048). Conversely, imCMS4 was associated with lack of pCR (OR = 0.25, 95% CI 0.07–0.88, p = 0.031). Classification maps demonstrated pathologist-interpretable associations with high stromal content in imCMS4 cases, associated with poor outcome. No significant association was found in imCMS2 or imCMS3. imCMS classification of pre-treatment biopsies is a fast and inexpensive solution to identify patient groups that could benefit from neoadjuvant LCRT. The significant associations between imCMS1/imCMS4 with pCR suggest the existence of predictive morphological features that could enhance standard pathological assessment."

        "abstract": "Seizure prediction remains a challenge, with approximately 30% of patients unresponsive to conventional treatments. Addressing this issue is crucial for improving patients’ quality of life, as timely intervention can mitigate the impact of seizures. In this research field, it is critical to identify the preictal interval, the transition from regular brain activity to a seizure. While previous studies have explored various Electroencephalogram (EEG) based methodologies for prediction, few have been clinically applicable. Recent studies have underlined the dynamic nature of EEG data, characterised by data changes with time, known as concept drifts, highlighting the need for automated methods to detect and adapt to these changes. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of automatic concept drift adaptation methods in seizure prediction. Three patient-specific seizure prediction approaches with a 10-minute prediction horizon are compared: a seizure prediction algorithm incorporating a window adjustment method by optimising performance with Support Vector Machines (Backwards-Landmark Window), a seizure prediction algorithm incorporating a data-batch (seizures) selection method using a logistic regression (Seizure-batch Regression), and a seizure prediction algorithm with a dynamic integration of classifiers (Dynamic Weighted Ensemble). These methods incorporate a retraining process after each seizure and use a combination of univariate linear features and SVM classifiers. The Firing Power was used as a post-processing technique to generate alarms before seizures. These methodologies were compared with a control approach based on the typical machine learning pipeline, considering a group of 37 patients with Temporal Lobe Epilepsy from the EPILEPSIAE database. The best-performing approach (Backwards-Landmark Window) achieved results of 0.75 ± 0.33 for sensitivity and 1.03 ± 1.00 for false positive rate per hour. This new strategy performed above chance for 89% of patients with the surrogate predictor, whereas the control approach only validated 46%."

Outcome prediction has classically been dichotomized into either dead/alive or favorable/unfavorable outcome. Binary outcome prediction models limit the possibility of detecting subtle yet significant improvements. We set out to explore different machine learning methods with the purpose of mapping their predictions to the full 8 grade scale GOSE following TBI. The models were set up using the variables: age, GCS-motor score, pupillary reaction, and Marshall CT score. For model setup and internal validation, a total of 866 patients could be included. For external validation, a cohort of 369 patients were included from Leuven, Belgium, and a cohort of 573 patients from the US multi-center ProTECT III study. Our findings indicate that proportional odds logistic regression (POLR), random forest regression, and a neural network model achieved accuracy values of 0.3–0.35 when applied to internal data, compared to the random baseline which is 0.125 for eight categories. The models demonstrated satisfactory performance during external validation in the data from Leuven, however, their performance were not satisfactory when applied to the ProTECT III dataset."

The purpose of this study aimed to assess the use of a clinical-grade physiological wearable monitoring system, ANNE One, to develop an artificial intelligence algorithm for (1) cough detection and (2) early detection of COVID-19, through the retrospective analysis of prospectively collected physiological data from longitudinal wear of ANNE sensors in a multicenter single arm study of subjects at high risk for COVID-19 due to occupational or home exposures. The study employed a two-fold approach: cough detection algorithm development and COVID-19 detection algorithm development. For cough detection, healthy individuals wore an ANNE One chest sensor during scripted activity. The final performance of the algorithm achieved an F-1 score of 83.3% in twenty-seven healthy subjects during biomarker validation. In the COVID-19 detection algorithm, individuals at high-risk for developing COVID-19 because of recent exposures received ANNE One sensors and completed daily symptom surveys. An algorithm analyzing vital parameters (heart rate, respiratory rate, cough count, etc.) for early COVID-19 detection was developed. The COVID-19 detection algorithm exhibited a sensitivity of 0.47 and specificity of 0.72 for detecting COVID-19 in 325 individuals with recent exposures. Participants demonstrated high adherence (≥ 4 days of wear per week). ANNE One shows promise for detection of COVID-19. Inclusion of respiratory biomarkers (e.g., cough count) enhanced the algorithm's predictive ability. These findings highlight the potential value of wearable devices in early disease detection and monitoring."

Structural and biochemical analyses confirmed the pH-selectivity and unique epitope targeted by SNS-101. These properties confer favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profiles on SNS-101. In syngeneic tumor models utilizing human VISTA knock-in mice, SNS-101 shows in vivo efficacy when combined with a PD-1 inhibitor, modulates cytokine and chemokine signaling, and alters the tumor microenvironment. In summary, SNS-101, currently in Phase I clinical trials, emerges as a promising therapeutic biologic for a wide range of patients whose cancer is refractory to current immunotherapy regimens."

The American College of Radiology has developed the Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS) to standardize the interpretation and reporting of thyroid ultrasound results. Within TI-RADS, a category 4 designation signifies a thyroid nodule with an intermediate level of suspicion for malignancy. Accurate classification of these nodules is crucial for proper management, as it can potentially reduce unnecessary surgeries and improve patient outcomes. This study utilized deep learning techniques to effectively classify TI-RADS category 4 thyroid nodules as either benign or malignant. A total of 500 patients were included in the study and randomly divided into a training group (350 patients) and a test group (150 patients). The YOLOv3 model was constructed and evaluated using various metrics, achieving an 84% accuracy in the classification of TI-RADS category 4 thyroid nodules. Based on the predictions of the model, along with clinical and ultrasound data, a nomogram was developed. The performance of the nomogram was superior in both the training and testing groups. Furthermore, the calibration curve demonstrated good agreement between predicted probabilities and actual outcomes. Decision curve analysis further confirmed that the nomogram provided greater net benefits. Ultimately, the YOLOv3 model and nomogram successfully improved the accuracy of distinguishing between benign and malignant TI-RADS category 4 thyroid nodules, which is crucial for proper management and improved patient outcomes."

Federated learning (FL) and feature selection (FS) techniques combined can help overcome these issues, as one provides the means of training models without exchanging sensitive data, while the other identifies the most informative features, reduces overfitting, and improves model interpretability. Our proposed FS pipeline based on FL principles targets data-driven radiomics FS in a multivariate survival study of non-small cell lung cancer patients. The pipeline was run across datasets from three institutions without patient-level data exchange. It includes two FS techniques, Correlation-based Feature Selection and LASSO regularization, and Cox Proportional-Hazard regression with Overall Survival as endpoint. Trained and validated on 828 patients overall, our pipeline yielded a radiomic signature comprising \"intensity-based energy\" and \"mean discretised intensity\". Validation resulted in a mean Harrell C-index of 0.59, showcasing fair efficacy in risk stratification. In conclusion, we suggest a distributed radiomics approach that incorporates preliminary feature selection to systematically decrease the feature set based on data-driven considerations. This aims to address dimensionality challenges beyond those associated with data constraints and interpretability concerns."

This integrates multiple DNN detection models, specifically single shot multibox detectors, using different training data for each special finding. For the learning phase, we prepared a total of 260 hand X-ray images, in which proximal interphalangeal (PIP) and metacarpophalangeal (MP) joints were annotated with mTSS by skilled rheumatologists and radiologists. We evaluated our model using five-fold cross-validation. The proposed model produced a higher detection accuracy, recall, precision, specificity, F-value, and intersection over union than individual detection models for both ankylosis and subluxation detection, with a detection rate above 99.8% for the MP and PIP joint regions. Our future research will aim at the development of an automatic diagnosis system that uses the proposed mTSS model to estimate the erosion and joint space narrowing score."

We leveraged rectal mucosa to identify patients who harbor CRC field carcinogenesis by evaluating chromatin 3D architecture. Supranucleosomal disordered chromatin chains (~ 5 to 20 nm, ~1 kbp) fold into chromatin packing domains (~ 100 to 200 nm, ~ 100 to 1000 kbp). In turn, the fractal-like conformation of DNA within chromatin domains and the folding of the genome into packing domains has been shown to influence multiple facets of gene transcription, including the transcriptional plasticity of cancer cells. We deployed an optical spectroscopic nanosensing technique, chromatin-sensitive partial wave spectroscopic microscopy (csPWS), to evaluate the packing density scaling D of the chromatin chain conformation within packing domains from rectal mucosa in 256 patients with varying degrees of progression to colorectal cancer. We found average packing scaling D of chromatin domains was elevated in tumor cells, histologically normal-appearing cells 4 cm proximal to the tumor, and histologically normal-appearing rectal mucosa compared to cells from control patients (p < 0.001). Nuclear D had a robust correlation with the model of 5-year risk of CRC with r2 = 0.94. Furthermore, rectal D was evaluated as a screening biomarker for patients with advanced adenomas presenting an AUC of 0.85 and 85% sensitivity and specificity. artificial intelligence-enhanced csPWS improved diagnostic performance with AUC = 0.90.

These normative reference values are traditionally calculated based on the quantitative values from a control group, which can be adjusted for relevant clinical co-variables, such as age or sex. However, these average normative values do not take into account the globality of the available quantitative information. For example, quantitative analysis of T1-weighted magnetic resonance images based on anatomical structure segmentation frequently includes over 100 cerebral structures in the quantitative reports, and these tend to be analyzed separately. In this study, we propose a global approach to personalized normative values for each brain structure using an unsupervised Artificial Intelligence technique known as generative manifold learning. We test the potential benefit of these personalized normative values in comparison with the more traditional average normative values on a population of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy operated for focal cortical dysplasia, as well as on a supplementary healthy group and on patients with Alzheimer’s disease."

        "abstract": "Freely available datasets have become an invaluable tool to propel data-driven research, especially in the field of critical care medicine. However, the number of datasets available is limited. This leads to the repeated reuse of datasets, inherently increasing the risk of selection bias. Additionally, the need arose to validate insights derived from one dataset with another. In 2023, the Salzburg Intensive Care database (SICdb) was introduced. SICdb offers insights in currently 27,386 intensive care admissions from 21,583 patients. It contains cases of general and surgical intensive care from all disciplines. Amongst others SICdb contains information about: diagnosis, therapies (including data on preceding surgeries), scoring, laboratory values, respiratory and vital signals, and configuration data. Data for SICdb (1.0.6) was collected at one single tertiary care institution of the Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine at the Salzburger Landesklinik (SALK) and Paracelsus Medical University (PMU) between 2013 and 2021. This article aims to elucidate on the characteristics of the dataset, the technical implementation, and provides analysis of its strengths and limitations."

The most severe MDD phenotype, namely major dysmood disorder (MDMD), is associated with adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and negative life events (NLEs) which induce cytokines/chemokines/growth factors. To delineate the impact of ACE + NLEs on physiosomatic and FF symptoms in first episode (FE)-MDMD, and examine whether these effects are mediated by immune profiles. ACEs, NLEs, physiosomatic and FF symptoms, and 48 cytokines/chemokines/growth factors were measured in 64 FE-MDMD patients and 32 normal controls. Physiosomatic, FF and gastro-intestinal symptoms belong to the same factor as depression, anxiety, melancholia, and insomnia. The first factor extracted from these seven domains is labeled the physio-affective phenome of depression. A part (59.0%) of the variance in physiosomatic symptoms is explained by the independent effects of interleukin (IL)-16 and IL-8 (positively), CCL3 and IL-1 receptor antagonist (inversely correlated). A part (46.5%) of the variance in physiosomatic (59.0%) symptoms is explained by the independent effects of interleukin (IL)-16, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) (positively) and combined activities of negative immunoregulatory cytokines (inversely associated). Partial least squares analysis shows that ACE + NLEs exert a substantial influence on the physio-affective phenome which are partly mediated by an immune network composed of interleukin-16, CCL27, TRAIL, macrophage-colony stimulating factor, and stem cell growth factor. The physiosomatic and FF symptoms of FE-MDMD are partly caused by immune-associated neurotoxicity due to T helper (Th)-1 polarization and M1 macrophage activation and relative lowered compensatory immunoregulatory protection."

        "abstract": "Many people with hearing loss struggle to understand speech in noisy environments, making noise robustness critical for hearing-assistive devices. Recently developed haptic hearing aids, which convert audio to vibration, can improve speech-in-noise performance for cochlear implant (CI) users and assist those unable to access hearing-assistive devices. They are typically body-worn rather than head-mounted, allowing additional space for batteries and microprocessors, and so can deploy more sophisticated noise-reduction techniques. The current study assessed whether a real-time-feasible dual-path recurrent neural network (DPRNN) can improve tactile speech-in-noise performance. Audio was converted to vibration on the wrist using a vocoder method, either with or without noise reduction. Performance was tested for speech in a multi-talker noise (recorded at a party) with a 2.5-dB signal-to-noise ratio. An objective assessment showed the DPRNN improved the scale-invariant signal-to-distortion ratio by 8.6 dB and substantially outperformed traditional noise-reduction (log-MMSE). A behavioural assessment in 16 participants showed the DPRNN improved tactile-only sentence identification in noise by 8.2%. This suggests that advanced techniques like the DPRNN could substantially improve outcomes with haptic hearing aids. Low-cost haptic devices could soon be an important supplement to hearing-assistive devices such as CIs or offer an alternative for people who cannot access CI technology."

        "abstract": "Artificial intelligence-powered deep learning methods are being used to diagnose brain tumors with high accuracy, owing to their ability to process large amounts of data. Magnetic resonance imaging stands as the gold standard for brain tumor diagnosis using machine vision, surpassing computed tomography, ultrasound, and X-ray imaging in its effectiveness. Despite this, brain tumor diagnosis remains a challenging endeavour due to the intricate structure of the brain. This study delves into the potential of deep transfer learning architectures to elevate the accuracy of brain tumor diagnosis. Transfer learning is a machine learning technique that allows us to repurpose pre-trained models on new tasks. This can be particularly useful for medical imaging tasks, where labelled data is often scarce. Four distinct transfer learning architectures were assessed in this study: ResNet152, VGG19, DenseNet169, and MobileNetv3. The models were trained and validated on a dataset from benchmark database: Kaggle. Five-fold cross validation was adopted for training and testing. To enhance the balance of the dataset and improve the performance of the models, image enhancement techniques were applied to the data for the four categories: pituitary, normal, meningioma, and glioma. MobileNetv3 achieved the highest accuracy of 99.75%, significantly outperforming other existing methods. This demonstrates the potential of deep transfer learning architectures to revolutionize the field of brain tumor diagnosis."

However not all patients benefit from the VH regimen and a way to rationally select between VH and Conventional Chemotherapy (CC) for individual AML patients is needed. Here, we developed a proteomic-based triaging strategy using Reverse-phase Protein Arrays (RPPA) to optimize therapy selection. We evaluated the expression of 411 proteins in 810 newly diagnosed adult AML patients, identifying 109 prognostic proteins, that divided into five patient expression profiles, which are useful for optimizing therapy selection. Furthermore, using machine learning algorithms, we determined a set of 14 proteins, among those 109, that were able to accurately recommend therapy, making it feasible for clinical application. Next, we identified a group of patients who did not benefit from either VH or CC and proposed target-based approaches to improve outcomes. Finally, we calculated that the clinical use of our proteomic strategy would have led to a change in therapy for 30% of patients, resulting in a 43% improvement in OS, resulting in around 2600 more cures from AML per year in the United States."

        "abstract": "The global burden of acute and chronic wounds presents a compelling case for enhancing wound classification methods, a vital step in diagnosing and determining optimal treatments. Recognizing this need, we introduce an innovative multi-modal network based on a deep convolutional neural network for categorizing wounds into four categories: diabetic, pressure, surgical, and venous ulcers. Our multi-modal network uses wound images and their corresponding body locations for more precise classification. A unique aspect of our methodology is incorporating a body map system that facilitates accurate wound location tagging, improving upon traditional wound image classification techniques. A distinctive feature of our approach is the integration of models such as VGG16, ResNet152, and EfficientNet within a novel architecture. This architecture includes elements like spatial and channel-wise Squeeze-and-Excitation modules, Axial Attention, and an Adaptive Gated Multi-Layer Perceptron, providing a robust foundation for classification. Our multi-modal network was trained and evaluated on two distinct datasets comprising relevant images and corresponding location information. Notably, our proposed network outperformed traditional methods, reaching an accuracy range of 74.79–100% for Region of Interest (ROI) without location classifications, 73.98–100% for ROI with location classifications, and 78.10–100% for whole image classifications. This marks a significant enhancement over previously reported performance metrics in the literature. Our results indicate the potential of our multi-modal network as an effective decision-support tool for wound image classification, paving the way for its application in various clinical contexts."

Lesion segmentation, feature extraction, and machine learning algorithms, including decision tree, support vector machine, random forest, feed-forward neural network, and discriminant analysis, were employed in the radiomics workflow. Key features such as Idmn, skewness, and long-run low grey level emphasis were identified as crucial in differentiation. The model demonstrated an accuracy of 83% in distinguishing COVID-19 from other benign nodules and 88% from malignant nodules. This study concludes that radiomics, through machine learning, serves as a valuable tool for non-invasive discrimination between COVID-19 and other benign and malignant lung nodules. The findings suggest the potential complementary role of radiomics in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia exhibiting lung nodules and suspicion of concurrent lung pathologies. The clinical relevance lies in the utilization of radiomics analysis for feature extraction and classification, contributing to the enhanced differentiation of lung nodules, particularly in the context of COVID-19."

This study investigated the genetic architecture of three brain age gaps (BAG) derived from gray matter volume (GM-BAG), white matter microstructure (WM-BAG), and functional connectivity (FC-BAG). We identified sixteen genomic loci that reached genome-wide significance (P-value < 5×10−8). A gene-drug-disease network highlighted genes linked to GM-BAG for treating neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders and WM-BAG genes for cancer therapy. GM-BAG displayed the most pronounced heritability enrichment in genetic variants within conserved regions. Oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, but not neurons, exhibited notable heritability enrichment in WM and FC-BAG, respectively. Mendelian randomization identified potential causal effects of several chronic diseases on brain aging, such as type 2 diabetes on GM-BAG and AD on WM-BAG. Our results provide insights into the genetics of human brain aging, with clinical implications for potential lifestyle and therapeutic interventions.

        "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) exhibits a significant death rate that consistently impacts human lives worldwide. Histopathological examination is the standard method for CRC diagnosis. However, it is complicated, time-consuming, and subjective. Computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) systems using digital pathology can help pathologists diagnose CRC faster and more accurately than manual histopathology examinations. Deep learning algorithms especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are advocated for diagnosis of CRC. Nevertheless, most previous CAD systems obtained features from one CNN, these features are of huge dimension. Also, they relied on spatial information only to achieve classification. In this paper, a CAD system is proposed called “Color-CADx” for CRC recognition. Different CNNs namely ResNet50, DenseNet201, and AlexNet are used for end-to-end classification at different training–testing ratios. Moreover, features are extracted from these CNNs and reduced using discrete cosine transform (DCT). DCT is also utilized to acquire spectral representation. Afterward, it is used to further select a reduced set of deep features. Furthermore, DCT coefficients obtained in the previous step are concatenated and the analysis of variance (ANOVA) feature selection approach is applied to choose significant features. Finally, machine learning classifiers are employed for CRC classification. Two publicly available datasets were investigated which are the NCT-CRC-HE-100 K dataset and the Kather_texture_2016_image_tiles dataset. The highest achieved accuracy reached 99.3% for the NCT-CRC-HE-100 K dataset and 96.8% for the Kather_texture_2016_image_tiles dataset. DCT and ANOVA have successfully lowered feature dimensionality thus reducing complexity. Color-CADx has demonstrated efficacy in terms of accuracy, as its performance surpasses that of the most recent advancements."

        "abstract": "Newborns are as the primary recipients of blood transfusions. There is a possibility of an association between blood transfusion and unfavorable outcomes. Such complications not only imperil the lives of newborns but also cause long hospitalization. Our objective is to explore the predictor variables that may lead to extended hospital stays in neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) patients who have undergone blood transfusions and develop a predictive nomogram. A retrospective review of 539 neonates who underwent blood transfusion was conducted using median and interquartile ranges to describe their length of stay (LOS). Neonates with LOS above the 75th percentile (P75) were categorized as having a long LOS. The Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression method was employed to screen variables and construct a risk model for long LOS. A multiple logistic regression prediction model was then constructed using the selected variables from the LASSO regression model. The significance of the prediction model was evaluated by calculating the area under the ROC curve (AUC) and assessing the confidence interval around the AUC. The calibration curve is used to further validate the model’s calibration and predictability. The model’s clinical effectiveness was assessed through decision curve analysis. To evaluate the generalizability of the model, fivefold cross-validation was employed. Internal validation of the models was performed using bootstrap validation. Among the 539 infants who received blood transfusions, 398 infants (P75) had a length of stay (LOS) within the normal range of 34 days, according to the interquartile range. However, 141 infants (P75) experienced long LOS beyond the normal range. The predictive model included six variables: gestational age (GA) (< 28 weeks), birth weight (BW) (< 1000 g), type of respiratory support, umbilical venous catheter (UVC), sepsis, and resuscitation frequency. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) for the training set was 0.851 (95% CI 0.805–0.891), and for the validation set, it was 0.859 (95% CI 0.789–0.920). Fivefold cross-validation indicates that the model has good generalization ability. The calibration curve demonstrated a strong correlation between the predicted risk and the observed actual risk, indicating good consistency. When the intervention threshold was set at 2%, the decision curve analysis indicated that the model had greater clinical utility. The results of our study have led to the development of a novel nomogram that can assist clinicians in predicting the probability of long hospitalization in blood transfused infants with reasonable accuracy. Our findings indicate that GA (< 28 weeks), BW(< 1000 g), type of respiratory support, UVC, sepsis, and resuscitation frequency are associated with a higher likelihood of extended hospital stays among newborns who have received blood transfusions."

Synthetic data generation holds the promise of effectively bypassing these boundaries allowing for simplified data accessibility and the prospect of synthetic control cohorts. We employed two different methodologies of generative artificial intelligence – CTAB-GAN+ and normalizing flows (NFlow) – to synthesize patient data derived from 1606 patients with acute myeloid leukemia, a heterogeneous hematological malignancy, that were treated within four multicenter clinical trials. Both generative models accurately captured distributions of demographic, laboratory, molecular and cytogenetic variables, as well as patient outcomes yielding high performance scores regarding fidelity and usability of both synthetic cohorts (n = 1606 each). Survival analysis demonstrated close resemblance of survival curves between original and synthetic cohorts. Inter-variable relationships were preserved in univariable outcome analysis enabling explorative analysis in our synthetic data. Additionally, training sample privacy is safeguarded mitigating possible patient re-identification, which we quantified using Hamming distances. We provide not only a proof-of-concept for synthetic data generation in multimodal clinical data for rare diseases, but also full public access to synthetic data sets to foster further research."

This prospective multicenter cohort study included adult COVID-19 patients in six intensive care units (ICUs) in Sweden between May 11, 2020 and May 10, 2021. Blood was sampled at admission, days two and seven in the ICU. The samples were batch analyzed for NGAL, creatinine, and cystatin c after the end of the study period. Initiation of CRRT and 90-day survival were used as dependent variables in regression models. Of 498 included patients, 494 were analyzed regarding CRRT and 399 were analyzed regarding survival. Seventy patients received CRRT and 154 patients did not survive past 90 days. NGAL, in combination with creatinine and cystatin c, predicted the subsequent initiation of CRRT with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.95. For mortality, NGAL, in combination with age and sex, had an AUC of 0.83. In conclusion, NGAL is a valuable biomarker for predicting subsequent initiation of CRRT and 90-day mortality in critical COVID-19. NGAL should be considered when developing future clinical scoring systems."

Data from 56 622 respondents of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE, 2017) aged 60 years and older with non-missing data were analyzed. Performance of LW was compared to a logistic regression, random forest and XGBoost classifier. Population-level ‘probable dementia’ prevalence was compared to estimates based on data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. As such, application of the prevalence-specific LW algorithm, based on recall and limitations in instrumental activities of daily living, reduced underreporting from 61.0 (95% CI, 53.3–68.7%) to 30.4% (95% CI, 19.3–41.4%), outperforming tested machine learning algorithms. Performance in other domains of health and cognitive function was similar for participants classified ‘probable dementia’ and those self-reporting physician-diagnosis of dementia. Dementia classification algorithms can be adapted to cross-national cohort surveys such as SHARE and help reduce underreporting of dementia with a minimal predictor set."

Current clinical assessments of PD-related postural instability are based on a retropulsion test, which introduces human error and only evaluates reactive balance. There is an unmet need for objective, multi-dimensional assessments of postural instability that directly reflect activities of daily living in which individuals may experience postural instability. In this study, we trained machine-learning models on insole plantar pressure data from 111 participants (44 with PD and 67 controls) as they performed simulated static and active postural tasks of activities that often occur during daily living. Models accurately classified PD from young controls (area under the curve (AUC) 0.99+/− 0.00), PD from age-matched controls (AUC 0.99+/− 0.01), and PD fallers from PD non-fallers (AUC 0.91+/− 0.08). Utilizing features from both static and active postural tasks significantly improved classification performances, and all tasks were useful for separating PD from controls; however, tasks with higher postural threats were preferred for separating PD fallers from PD non-fallers."

However, model training is often difficult due to label scarcity in the medical domain, and a model’s usage is limited by the specific task and disease for which it is trained. Additionally, most models in histopathology leverage only image data, a stark contrast to how humans teach each other and reason about histopathologic entities. We introduce CONtrastive learning from Captions for Histopathology (CONCH), a visual-language foundation model developed using diverse sources of histopathology images, biomedical text and, notably, over 1.17 million image–caption pairs through task-agnostic pretraining. Evaluated on a suite of 14 diverse benchmarks, CONCH can be transferred to a wide range of downstream tasks involving histopathology images and/or text, achieving state-of-the-art performance on histology image classification, segmentation, captioning, and text-to-image and image-to-text retrieval. CONCH represents a substantial leap over concurrent visual-language pretrained systems for histopathology, with the potential to directly facilitate a wide array of machine learning-based workflows requiring minimal or no further supervised fine-tuning."

However, speckle noise hinders the quality of rapid OCT imaging, hampering the extraction and reliability of biomarkers that require time series. By synchronizing the acquisition of OCT images with the timing of the cardiac pulse, we transform a low-quality OCT video into a clear version by phase-wrapping each frame to the heart pulsation and averaging frames that correspond to the same instant in the cardiac cycle. Here, we compare the performance of our one-cycle denoising strategy with a deep-learning architecture, Noise2Noise, as well as classical denoising methods such as BM3D and Non-Local Means (NLM). We systematically analyze different image quality descriptors as well as region-specific metrics to assess the denoising performance based on the anatomy of the eye. The one-cycle method achieves the highest denoising performance, increases image quality and preserves the high-resolution structures within the eye tissues. The proposed workflow can be readily implemented in a clinical setting."

        "abstract": "Hepatic ischemia–reperfusion injury (HIRI) elicits an immune-inflammatory response that may result in hepatocyte necrosis and apoptosis, ultimately culminating in postoperative hepatic dysfunction and hepatic failure. The precise mechanisms governing the pathophysiology of HIRI remain incompletely understood, necessitating further investigation into key molecules and pathways implicated in disease progression to guide drug discovery and potential therapeutic interventions. Gene microarray data was downloaded from the GEO expression profile database. Integrated bioinformatic analyses were performed to identify HIRI signature genes, which were subsequently validated for expression levels and diagnostic efficacy. Finally, the gene expression was verified in an experimental HIRI model and the effect of anti-IL17A antibody intervention in three time points (including pre-ischemic, post-ischemic, and at 1 h of reperfusion) on HIRI and the expression of these genes was investigated. Bioinformatic analyses of the screened characterized genes revealed that inflammation, immune response, and cell death modulation were significantly associated with HIRI pathophysiology. CCL2, BTG2, GADD45A, FOS, CXCL10, TNFRSF12A, and IL-17 pathway were identified as key components involved in the HIRI. Serum and liver IL-17A expression were significantly upregulated during the initial phase of HIRI. Pretreatment with anti-IL-17A antibody effectively alleviated the damage of liver tissue, suppressed inflammatory factors, and serum transaminase levels, and downregulated the mRNA expression of CCL2, GADD45A, FOS, CXCL10, and TNFRSF12A. Injection of anti-IL17A antibody after ischemia and at 1 h of reperfusion failed to demonstrate anti-inflammatory and attenuating HIRI benefits relative to earlier intervention. Our study reveals that the IL-17 pathway and related genes may be involved in the proinflammatory mechanism of HIRI, which may provide a new perspective and theoretical basis for the prevention and treatment of HIRI."

        "abstract": "Three-dimensional facial stereophotogrammetry provides a detailed representation of craniofacial soft tissue without the use of ionizing radiation. While manual annotation of landmarks serves as the current gold standard for cephalometric analysis, it is a time-consuming process and is prone to human error. The aim in this study was to develop and evaluate an automated cephalometric annotation method using a deep learning-based approach. Ten landmarks were manually annotated on 2897 3D facial photographs. The automated landmarking workflow involved two successive DiffusionNet models. The dataset was randomly divided into a training and test dataset. The precision of the workflow was evaluated by calculating the Euclidean distances between the automated and manual landmarks and compared to the intra-observer and inter-observer variability of manual annotation and a semi-automated landmarking method. The workflow was successful in 98.6% of all test cases. The deep learning-based landmarking method achieved precise and consistent landmark annotation. The mean precision of 1.69 ± 1.15 mm was comparable to the inter-observer variability (1.31 ± 0.91 mm) of manual annotation. Automated landmark annotation on 3D photographs was achieved with the DiffusionNet-based approach. The proposed method allows quantitative analysis of large datasets and may be used in diagnosis, follow-up, and virtual surgical planning."

We aimed to verify brain age differences in PD-CI and PD-NCI and their clinical significance. A total of 94 participants (PD-CI, n = 27; PD-NCI, n = 34; controls, n = 33) were recruited. Predicted age difference (PAD) based on gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) features were estimated to represent the degree of brain aging. Patients with PD-CI showed greater GM-PAD (7.08 ± 6.64 years) and WM-PAD (8.82 ± 7.69 years) than those with PD-NCI (GM: 1.97 ± 7.13, Padjusted = 0.011; WM: 4.87 ± 7.88, Padjusted = 0.049) and controls (GM: -0.58 ± 7.04, Padjusted = 0.004; WM: 0.88 ± 7.45, Padjusted = 0.002) after adjusting demographic factors. In patients with PD, GM-PAD was negatively correlated with MMSE (Padjusted = 0.011) and MoCA (Padjusted = 0.013) and positively correlated with UPDRS Part II (Padjusted = 0.036). WM-PAD was negatively correlated with logical memory of immediate and delayed recalls (Padjusted = 0.003 and Padjusted < 0.001). Also, altered brain regions in PD-CI were identified and significantly correlated with brain age measures, implicating the neuroanatomical underpinning of neurodegeneration in PD-CI. Moreover, the brain age metrics can improve the classification between PD-CI and PD-NCI. The findings suggest that patients with PD-CI had advanced brain aging that was associated with poor cognitive functions. The identified neuroimaging features and brain age measures can serve as potential biomarkers of PD-CI."

We trained an LDM with n = 2832 CE-MIPs of breast MRI examinations of n = 1966 patients (median age: 50 years) acquired between the years 2015 and 2020. The LDM was subsequently conditioned with n = 756 segmented lesions from n = 407 examinations, indicating their location and BI-RADS scores. By applying the LDM, synthetic images were generated from the segmentations of an independent validation dataset. Lesions, anatomical correctness, and realistic impression of synthetic and real MIP images were further assessed in a multi-rater study with five independent raters, each evaluating n = 204 MIPs (50% real/50% synthetic images). The detection of synthetic MIPs by the raters was akin to random guessing with an AUC of 0.58. Interrater reliability of the lesion assessment was high both for real (Kendall’s W = 0.77) and synthetic images (W = 0.85). A higher AUC was observed for the detection of suspicious lesions (BI-RADS \\(\\ge \\) 4) in synthetic MIPs (0.88 vs. 0.77; p = 0.051). Our results show that LDMs can generate lesion-conditioned MRI-derived CE subtraction MIPs of the breast, however, they also indicate that the LDM tended to generate rather typical or ‘textbook representations’ of lesions."

Foundation models are generally trained using self-supervised learning and excel in reducing the demand for training samples in downstream applications. This is especially important in medicine, where large labelled datasets are often scarce. Here, we developed a foundation model for cancer imaging biomarker discovery by training a convolutional encoder through self-supervised learning using a comprehensive dataset of 11,467 radiographic lesions. The foundation model was evaluated in distinct and clinically relevant applications of cancer imaging-based biomarkers. We found that it facilitated better and more efficient learning of imaging biomarkers and yielded task-specific models that significantly outperformed conventional supervised and other state-of-the-art pretrained implementations on downstream tasks, especially when training dataset sizes were very limited. Furthermore, the foundation model was more stable to input variations and showed strong associations with underlying biology. Our results demonstrate the tremendous potential of foundation models in discovering new imaging biomarkers that may extend to other clinical use cases and can accelerate the widespread translation of imaging biomarkers into clinical settings."

The aim of this study was to develop and internally validate machine-learning algorithms to identify a combination of variables for the early diagnosis of acromegaly. This retrospective population-based study was conducted between 2011 and 2018 using data from the claims databases of Sicily Region, in Southern Italy. To identify combinations of potential predictors of acromegaly diagnosis, conditional and unconditional penalized multivariable logistic regression models and three machine learning algorithms (i.e., the Recursive Partitioning and Regression Tree, the Random Forest and the Support Vector Machine) were used, and their performance was evaluated. The random forest (RF) algorithm achieved the highest Area under the ROC Curve value of 0.83 (95% CI 0.79–0.87). The sensitivity in the test set, computed at the optimal threshold of predicted probabilities, ranged from 28% for the unconditional logistic regression model to 69% for the RF. Overall, the only diagnosis predictor selected by all five models and algorithms was the number of immunosuppressants-related pharmacy claims. The other predictors selected by at least two models were eventually combined in an unconditional logistic regression to develop a meta-score that achieved an acceptable discrimination accuracy (AUC = 0.71, 95% CI 0.66–0.75). Findings of this study showed that data-driven machine learning algorithms may play a role in supporting the early diagnosis of rare diseases such as acromegaly."

Healthy eyes imaged on wide field swept-source optical coherence tomography were included. Delineation of CIB and COB was done based on our previously reported methods. Quantitative analysis of the surfaces of CIB and COB was based on analyzing best fit spherical radius (R) (overall and sectoral). One hundred and seven eyes of 74 subjects with a mean age of 46.4 ± 19.3 years were evaluated. Overall, R COB (mean ± SD: 22.5 ± 4.8 mm) < R CIB (32.4 ± 9.4 mm). Central sector had the least R at COB (7.2 ± 5.9 mm) as well as CIB (25.1 ± 14.3 mm) across all age groups. Regression analysis between R (CIB) and age (r = −0.31, r2 = 0.09) showed negative correlation (P < 0.001) and that between R (COB) and age was positive (r = 0.26, r2 = 0.07) (P = 0.01). To conclude, central sector is the steepest sector in comparison to all the other sectors. This is indicative of a prolate shape of choroidal contour at CIB and COB. Outer boundary of choroid is steeper than inner boundary across all age groups. However, with ageing, outer boundary becomes flatter and inner boundary becomes steeper."

Less is known about the contribution of protein biomarkers to clinical sepsis phenotypes and their importance for treatment effects in randomized trials of resuscitation. The objective is to use both clinical and biomarker data in the Protocol-Based Care for Early Septic Shock (ProCESS) randomized trial to determine sepsis phenotypes and to test for heterogeneity of treatment effect by phenotype comparing usual care to protocolized early, goal-directed therapy(EGDT). In this secondary analysis of a subset of patients with biomarker sampling in the ProCESS trial (n = 543), we identified sepsis phenotypes prior to randomization using latent class analysis of 20 clinical and biomarker variables. Logistic regression was used to test for interaction between phenotype and treatment arm for 60-day inpatient mortality. Among 543 patients with severe sepsis or septic shock in the ProCESS trial, a 2-class model best fit the data (p = 0.01). Phenotype 1 (n = 66, 12%) had increased IL-6, ICAM, and total bilirubin and decreased platelets compared to phenotype 2 (n = 477, 88%, p < 0.01 for all). Phenotype 1 had greater 60-day inpatient mortality compared to Phenotype 2 (41% vs 16%; p < 0.01). Treatment with EGDT was associated with worse 60-day inpatient mortality compared to usual care (58% vs. 23%) in Phenotype 1 only (p-value for interaction = 0.05). The 60-day inpatient mortality was similar comparing EGDT to usual care in Phenotype 2 (16% vs. 17%). We identified 2 sepsis phenotypes using latent class analysis of clinical and protein biomarker data at randomization in the ProCESS trial. Phenotype 1 had increased inflammation, organ dysfunction and worse clinical outcomes compared to phenotype 2. Response to EGDT versus usual care differed by phenotype."

The application was piloted for three months to monitor the response of 520 adults. Potential improvements were characterized, considering benchmarking, expert guidance, and standards. Salud Activa (English: Active Health) has two crowdsourcing modules: Nutritional scanner, scanning products' bar codes, providing nutritional data, and allowing new product registry feeding our databases; Surveys, comprising gradually-released NCD questions. Three intervention modules were generated: Drinks diary, a beverage assessment component to receive hydration recommendations; Step counter, monitoring users’ steps via Google Fit/Health—iOS; Metabolic Avatar, interconnecting modules and changing as a function of beverage and step records. The 3-month median of Salud Activa use was seven days (IQR = 3–12), up to 35% of participants completed a Survey section, and 157 food products were registered through Nutritional scanner. Better customization might benefit usability and user engagement. Quantitative and qualitative data will enhance Salud Activa’s design, user uptake, and efficacy in interventions delivered through this platform."

The security of information transmitted online has grown to be a critical concern, particularly in the transfer of medical data. To overcome this, the data must be delivered securely without being altered or lost. This can be possibly done by combining the principles of cryptography and steganography. In the recent past, steganography is used with simpler methods like the least significant bit manipulation technique, in order to encode a lower-resolution image into a higher-resolution image. Here, we attempt to use deep neural networks to combine many two-dimensional colour images of the same resolution into a single cover image with the same resolution. In this technique, many secret images are concealed inside a single cover image using deep neural networks. The embedded cover image is then encrypted using a 3D chaotic map for diffusion and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) for confusion to increase security.Supporting the fact that neural networks experience losses, the proposed system recovers up to 93% of the hidden image concealed in the original image. As the secret image features are identified and combined along with the cover image, the time complexity involved in the security process is minimized by 78% compared to securing the original data."

It is of necessity to predict OSA patients who are susceptible to resistant hypertension. Hence, we conducted a retrospective study based on the clinical records of OSA patients admitted to Yixing Hospital Affiliated to Jiangsu University from January 2018 to December 2022. According to different time periods, patients diagnosed between January 2018 and December 2021 were included in the training set (n = 539) for modeling, and those diagnosed between January 2022 and December 2022 were enrolled into the validation set (n = 259) for further assessment. The incidence of RH in the training set and external validation set was comparable (P = 0.396). The related clinical data of patients enrolled were collected and analyzed through univariate analysis and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression analysis to identify independent risk factors and construct a nomogram. Finally, five variables were confirmed as independent risk factors for OSA patients with RH, including smoking, heart disease, neck circumference, AHI and T90. The nomogram established on the basis of variables above was shown to have good discrimination and calibration in both the training set and validation set. Decision curve analysis indicated that the nomogram was useful for a majority of OSA patients. Therefore, our nomogram might be useful to identify OSA patients at high risk of developing RH and facilitate the individualized management of OSA patients in clinical practice."

Efforts to curate research populations, the increasing availability of real-world data, and advances in natural language processing, particularly large language models, allow for a more granular comparison of populations than previously possible. This study includes two research populations and two real-world data-derived (RWD) populations. The research populations are the Harvard Biomarkers Study (HBS, N = 935), a longitudinal biomarkers cohort study with in-person structured study visits; and Fox Insights (N = 36,660), an online self-survey-based research study of the Michael J. Fox Foundation. Real-world cohorts are the Optum Integrated Claims-electronic health records (N = 157,475), representing wide-scale linked medical and claims data and de-identified data from Mass General Brigham (MGB, N = 22,949), an academic hospital system. Structured, de-identified electronic health records data at MGB are supplemented using a manually validated natural language processing with a large language model to extract measurements of PD progression. Motor and cognitive progression scores change more rapidly in MGB than HBS (median survival until H&Y 3: 5.6 years vs. >10, p < 0.001; mini-mental state exam median decline 0.28 vs. 0.11, p < 0.001; and clinically recognized cognitive decline, p = 0.001). In real-world populations, patients are diagnosed more than eleven years later (RWD mean of 72.2 vs. research mean of 60.4, p < 0.001). After diagnosis, in real-world cohorts, treatment with PD medications has initiated an average of 2.3 years later (95% CI: [2.1–2.4]; p < 0.001). This study provides a detailed characterization of Parkinson’s progression in diverse populations. It delineates systemic divergences in the patient populations enrolled in research settings vs. patients in the real-world. These divergences are likely due to a combination of selection bias and real population differences, but exact attribution of the causes is challenging. This study emphasizes a need to utilize multiple data sources and to diligently consider potential biases when planning, choosing data sources, and performing downstream tasks and analyses."

Therefore, it is necessary and important to monitor neonates’ bilirubin levels in real-time for immediate intervention. However, current screening protocols have their inherent limitations, necessitating more convenient measurements. In this proof-of-concept study, we evaluated the feasibility of using machine learning for the screening of hyperbilirubinemia in neonates from smartphone-acquired photographs. Different machine learning models were compared and evaluated to gain a better understanding of feature selection and model performance in bilirubin determination. An in vitro study was conducted with a bilirubin-containing tissue phantom to identify potential biological and environmental confounding factors. The findings of this study present a systematic characterization of the confounding effect of various factors through separate parametric tests. These tests uncover potential techniques in image pre-processing, highlighting important biological features (light scattering property and skin thickness) and external features (ISO, lighting conditions and white balance), which together contribute to robust model approaches for accurately determining bilirubin concentrations. By obtaining an accuracy of 0.848 in classification and 0.812 in regression, these findings indicate strong potential in aiding in the design of clinical studies using patient-derived images."

A DLR signature was created based on the deep learning and handcrafted features, and the DLRN was then developed based on the signature and four independent clinical parameters. The DLRN exhibited good performance, yielding areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.914, 0.929, and 0.952 in the three external validation cohorts, respectively. Decision curve and calibration curve analyses demonstrated the favorable clinical value and calibration of the nomogram. In addition, the DLRN outperformed five experienced radiologists in all cohorts. This has the potential to guide appropriate management of the axilla in patients with breast cancer, including avoiding overtreatment."

Here we report the existence of hitherto unidentified hierarchical levels in the temporal organization of HPA on the ultradian scale: on the minute's scale, passive periods are followed by activity bursts of similar intensity (‘quanta’) that are organized into superstructures on the hours- and on the daily scale. The time course of HPA can be considered a stochastic, quasi-binary process, where quanta, assigned to task-oriented actions are organized into work packages on higher levels of hierarchy. In order to grasp the essence of this complex dynamic behaviour, we established a stochastic mathematical model which could reproduce the main statistical features of real activity time series. The results are expected to provide important data for developing novel behavioural models and advancing the diagnostics of neurological or psychiatric diseases."

Radiologists could reliably detect tumors using machine learning algorithms without extensive surgery. However, a few important challenges arise, such as (i) the selection of the most important deep learning architecture for classification (ii) an expert in the field who can assess the output of deep learning models. These difficulties motivate us to propose an efficient and accurate system based on deep learning and evolutionary optimization for the classification of four types of brain modalities (t1 tumor, t1ce tumor, t2 tumor, and flair tumor) on a large-scale MRI database. Thus, a CNN architecture is modified based on domain knowledge and connected with an evolutionary optimization algorithm to select hyperparameters. In parallel, a Stack Encoder–Decoder network is designed with ten convolutional layers. The features of both models are extracted and optimized using an improved version of Grey Wolf with updated criteria of the Jaya algorithm. The improved version speeds up the learning process and improves the accuracy. Finally, the selected features are fused using a novel parallel pooling approach that is classified using machine learning and neural networks. Two datasets, BraTS2020 and BraTS2021, have been employed for the experimental tasks and obtained an improved average accuracy of 98% and a maximum single-classifier accuracy of 99%. Comparison is also conducted with several classifiers, techniques, and neural nets; the proposed method achieved improved performance."

However, the emergence of large databases, including genetic data linked to cardiac magnetic resonance facilitates the investigation of more nuanced patterns of cardiac shape variability than those studied so far. Here we propose a framework for gene discovery coined unsupervised phenotype ensembles. The unsupervised phenotype ensemble builds a redundant yet highly expressive representation by pooling a set of phenotypes learnt in an unsupervised manner, using deep learning models trained with different hyperparameters. These phenotypes are then analysed via genome-wide association studies, retaining only highly confident and stable associations across the ensemble. We applied our approach to the UK Biobank database to extract geometric features of the left ventricle from image-derived three-dimensional meshes. We demonstrate that our approach greatly improves the discoverability of genes that influence left ventricle shape, identifying 49 loci with study-wide significance and 25 with suggestive significance. We argue that our approach would enable more extensive discovery of gene associations with image-derived phenotypes for other organs or image modalities."

The literature is mixed about how accurately these self-reports track objectively (e.g. via polysomnography) assessed sleep quality, with frequent reports of little to no association. However, previous research on this question focused on between-subject designs, which may be confounded by trait-level variables. In the current study, we used the novel Budapest Sleep, Experiences and Traits Study (BSETS) dataset to investigate if within-subject differences in subjectively reported sleep quality are related to sleep macrostructure and quantitative EEG variables assessed using a mobile EEG headband. We found clear evidence that self-reported sleep quality in the morning is influenced by within-subject variations in sleep onset latency, wake after sleep onset, total sleep time, and sleep efficiency. These effects were replicated if detailed sleep composition metrics (percentage and latency of specific vigilance states) or two alternative measures of subjective sleep quality were used instead. We found no effect of the number of awakenings or relative EEG delta and sigma power. Between-subject effects (relationships between individual mean values of sleep metrics and subjective sleep quality) were also found, highlighting that analyses focusing only on these may be erroneous. Our findings show that while previous investigations of this issue may have been confounded by between-subject effects, objective sleep quality is indeed reflected in subjective sleep ratings."

The model was trained on data from the 18–22-week anomaly scan conducted in seven hospitals from 2008 to 2018. Prospective validation involved 100 patients from two hospitals. A total of 5363 images from 2551 pregnancies were used for training and validation. The model's segmentation accuracy depended on image quality measured by a quality score (QS). It achieved an overall average accuracy of 0.91 (SD 0.09) across the test set, with images having above-average QS scoring 0.97 (SD 0.03). During prospective validation of 192 images, clinicians rated 44.8% (SD 9.8) of images as equal in quality, 18.69% (SD 5.7) favoring auto-captured images and 36.51% (SD 9.0) preferring manually captured ones. Images with above average QS showed better agreement on segmentations (p < 0.001) and QS (p < 0.001) with fetal medicine experts. Auto-capture saved additional planes beyond protocol requirements, resulting in more comprehensive echocardiographies. Low QS had adverse effect on both model performance and clinician’s agreement with model feedback. The findings highlight the importance of developing and evaluating AI models based on ‘noisy’ real-life data rather than pursuing the highest accuracy possible with retrospective academic-grade data."

        "abstract": "There is an increasing concern about the health effects of exposure to a mixture of pollutants. This study aimed to evaluate the associations between serum levels of heavy/essential metals ([Arsenic (As), Cadmium (Cd), Mercury (Hg), Lead (Pb), Nickel (Ni), Chromium (Cr), Copper (Cu), Iron (Fe), and Zinc (Zn)]) and the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). Data were collected from 450 participants (150 with CVDs, 150 with T2D, and 150 healthy subjects) randomly selected from the Ravansar Non-Communicable Disease (RaNCD) cohort in Western Iran, covering the years 2018–2023. Trace element levels in the serum samples were assayed using ICP-MS. Logistic regression was performed to estimate the adjusted risk of exposure to single and multi-metals and CVD/T2D. Odds ratios were adjusted for age, sex, education, residential areas, hypertension, and BMI. The mixture effect of exposure to multi-metals and CVD/T2D was obtained using Quantile G-computation (QGC). In the logistic regression model, chromium, nickel, and zinc levels were associated with CVD, and significant trends were observed for these chemical quartiles (P < 0.001). Arsenic, chromium, and copper levels were also associated with T2D. The weight quartile sum (WQS) index was significantly associated with both CVD (OR 4.17, 95% CI 2.16–7.69) and T2D (OR 11.96, 95% CI 5.65–18.26). Cd, Pb, and Ni were the most heavily weighed chemicals in these models.The Cd had the highest weight among the metals in the CVD model (weighted at 0.78), followed by Hg weighted at 0.197. For T2D, the serum Pb (weighted at 0.32), Ni (weighted at 0.19), Cr (weighted at 0.17), and Cd (weighted at 0.14) were the most weighted in the G-computation model. The results showed the significant role of toxic and essential elements in CVDs and T2D risk. This association may be driven primarily by cadmium and mercury for CVDs and Pb, Ni, Cr, and Cd for T2D, respectively. Prospective studies with higher sample sizes are necessary to confirm or refute our preliminary results as well as to determine other important elements."

        "abstract": "Achieving proper socket fit is crucial for the effective use of a prosthesis. However, digital socket design lacks standardization and presents a steep learning curve for prosthetists. While research has focused on digital socket design for the lower-limb population, there is a research gap in upper-limb socket design. This study aimed to characterize the design (rectification) process for the transradial socket, specifically the three-quarter Northwestern-style design, towards the development of a more systematic, data-driven socket design approach. Fourteen (n = 14) pairs of unrectified and rectified plaster models were compared. Six common rectification zones were identified through shape analysis, with zones of plaster addition being the most prominent in terms of volume and surface area. A novel 3D vector mapping technique was employed, which revealed that most of the shape changes occurred in the anterior–posterior and proximal–distal directions. Overall, the interquartile range of each rectification zone demonstrated reasonable consistency in terms of volume, surface deviation, and 3D vector representation. The initial findings from this study support the potential for quantitively modelling the transradial socket design process. This opens the door for developing tools for categorizing and predicting socket designs across diverse populations through the application of techniques such as machine learning."

        "abstract": "Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide, and early diagnosis and prompt medical intervention are thus crucial. Frequent monitoring of stroke patients is also essential to assess treatment efficacy and detect complications earlier. While computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are commonly used for stroke diagnosis, they cannot be easily used onsite, nor for frequent monitoring purposes. To meet those requirements, an electromagnetic imaging (EMI) device, which is portable, non-invasive, and non-ionizing, has been developed. It uses a headset with an antenna array that irradiates the head with a safe low-frequency EM field and captures scattered fields to map the brain using a complementary set of physics-based and data-driven algorithms, enabling quasi-real-time detection, two-dimensional localization, and classification of strokes. This study reports clinical findings from the first time the device was used on stroke patients. The clinical results on 50 patients indicate achieving an overall accuracy of 98% in classification and 80% in two-dimensional quadrant localization. With its lightweight design and potential for use by a single para-medical staff at the point of care, the device can be used in intensive care units, emergency departments, and by paramedics for onsite diagnosis."

We assessed 18 clinical, behavioral, and socioeconomic features, employing machine learning models such as eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Elastic regression, K-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest. For comparison, we used logistic regression and a decision rule as reference models and validated six external models, with focus on the Framingham risk model. The top-performing models consistently included XGBoost, Elastic regression and SVM. These models efficiently identified hypertension risk, even among individuals with optimal baseline BP (< 120/80 mmHg), although improvement over reference models was modest. The recalibrated Framingham risk model outperformed the reference models, approaching the best-performing ML models. Important features included age, systolic and diastolic BP, body mass index, height, and family history of hypertension. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that linear effects sufficed for a well-performing model. The best models efficiently predicted hypertension risk, even among those with optimal or normal baseline BP, using few features. The recalibrated Framingham risk model proved effective in our cohort."

We collected comprehensive clinical, genomic, and pathology data from a cohort of OSCC patients in the TCGA dataset and used machine learning and deep learning algorithms to identify relevant features that are predictive of survival outcomes. Our analyses included 406 OSCC patients. Initial analyses involved gene expression analyses, principal component analyses, gene enrichment analyses, and feature importance analyses. These insights were foundational for subsequent model development. Furthermore, we applied five machine learning/deep learning algorithms (Random Survival Forest, Gradient Boosting Survival Analysis, Cox PH, Fast Survival SVM, and DeepSurv) for survival prediction. Our initial analyses revealed relevant gene expression variations and biological pathways, laying the groundwork for robust feature selection in model building. The results showed that the multimodal model outperformed the unimodal models across all methods, with c-index values of 0.722 for RSF, 0.633 for GBSA, 0.625 for FastSVM, 0.633 for CoxPH, and 0.515 for DeepSurv. When considering only important features, the multimodal model continued to outperform the unimodal models, with c-index values of 0.834 for RSF, 0.747 for GBSA, 0.718 for FastSVM, 0.742 for CoxPH, and 0.635 for DeepSurv. Our results demonstrate the potential of pathogenomics and AI-based techniques in improving the accuracy of prognostic prediction in OSCC, which may ultimately aid in the development of personalized treatment strategies for patients with this devastating disease."

However, while some findings are promising in the light of diagnostic marker research, many of these approaches lack the scalability for adequate and effective translation to everyday clinical practice. In this study, our aim was to explore the use of objective computer vision video analysis of real-world autism diagnostic interviews in a clinical sample of children and young individuals in the transition to adulthood to predict diagnosis. Specifically, we trained a support vector machine learning model on interpersonal synchrony data recorded in Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2) interviews of patient-clinician dyads. Our model was able to classify dyads involving an autistic patient (n = 56) with a balanced accuracy of 63.4% against dyads including a patient with other psychiatric diagnoses (n = 38). Further analyses revealed no significant associations between our classification metrics with clinical ratings. We argue that, given the above-chance performance of our classifier in a highly heterogeneous sample both in age and diagnosis, with few adjustments this highly scalable approach presents a viable route for future diagnostic marker research in autism."

We use a unique dataset containing 44 million records of almost all inpatient stays from 2003 to 2014 in Austria to investigate disease trajectories. We develop a new, multilayer disease network approach to quantitatively analyze how cooccurrences of two or more diagnoses form and evolve over the life course of patients. Nodes represent diagnoses in age groups of ten years; each age group makes up a layer of the comorbidity multilayer network. Inter-layer links encode a significant correlation between diagnoses (p < 0.001, relative risk > 1.5), while intra-layers links encode correlations between diagnoses across different age groups. We use an unsupervised clustering algorithm for detecting typical disease trajectories as overlapping clusters in the multilayer comorbidity network. We identify critical events in a patient’s career as points where initially overlapping trajectories start to diverge towards different states. We identified 1260 distinct disease trajectories (618 for females, 642 for males) that on average contain 9 (IQR 2–6) different diagnoses that cover over up to 70 years (mean 23 years). We found 70 pairs of diverging trajectories that share some diagnoses at younger ages but develop into markedly different groups of diagnoses at older ages. The disease trajectory framework can help us to identify critical events as specific combinations of risk factors that put patients at high risk for different diagnoses decades later. Our findings enable a data-driven integration of personalized life-course perspectives into clinical decision-making."

Improving long-term outcome predictions after thrombectomy can enhance treatment quality by supporting clinical decision-making. With the advent of interpretable deep learning methods in recent years, it is now possible to develop trustworthy, high-performing prediction models. This study introduces an uncertainty-aware, graph deep learning model that predicts endovascular thrombectomy outcomes using clinical features and imaging biomarkers. The model targets long-term functional outcomes, defined by the three-month modified Rankin Score (mRS), and mortality rates. A sample of 220 AIS patients in the anterior circulation who underwent endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) was included, with 81 (37%) demonstrating good outcomes (mRS\\(\\le\\)2). The performance of the different algorithms evaluated was comparable, with the maximum validation under the curve (AUC) reaching 0.87 using graph convolutional networks (GCN) for mRS prediction and 0.86 using fully connected networks (FCN) for mortality prediction. Moderate performance was obtained at admission (AUC of 0.76 using GCN), which improved to 0.84 post-thrombectomy and to 0.89 a day after stroke. Reliable uncertainty prediction of the model could be demonstrated."

Employing machine learning techniques on data from 50 PD patients and 29 healthy controls, PDMotion achieves accuracies of 0.878 for PD status prediction and 0.715 for severity assessment. A post-hoc explanation model is employed to assess the importance of features and tasks in diagnosis and severity evaluation. Notably, novel tasks that are not adapted from MDS-UPDRS Part III like the circle drawing, coordination test, and alternative tapping test are found to be highly important, suggesting digital assessments for PD can go beyond digitizing existing tests. The alternative tapping test emerges as the most significant task. Using its features alone achieves prediction accuracies comparable to the full task set, underscoring its potential as an independent screening tool. This study addresses a notable research gap by digitalizing a wide array of tests, including novel ones, and conducting a comparative analysis of their feature and task importance. These insights provide guidance for task selection and future development in PD mobile assessments, a field previously lacking such comparative studies."

        "abstract": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive disease leading to cognitive decline, and to prevent it, researchers seek to diagnose mild cognitive impairment (MCI) early. Particularly, non-amnestic MCI (naMCI) is often mistaken for normal aging as the representative symptom of AD, memory decline, is absent. Subjective cognitive decline (SCD), an intermediate step between normal aging and MCI, is crucial for prediction or early detection of MCI, which determines the presence of AD spectrum pathology. We developed a computer-based cognitive task to classify the presence or absence of AD pathology and stage within the AD spectrum, and attempted to perform multi-stage classification through electroencephalography (EEG) during resting and memory encoding state. The resting and memory-encoding states of 58 patients (20 with SCD, 10 with naMCI, 18 with aMCI, and 10 with AD) were measured and classified into four groups. We extracted features that could reflect the phase, spectral, and temporal characteristics of the resting and memory-encoding states. For the classification, we compared nine machine learning models and three deep learning models using Leave-one-subject-out strategy. Significant correlations were found between the existing neurophysiological test scores and performance of our computer-based cognitive task for all cognitive domains. In all models used, the memory-encoding states realized a higher classification performance than resting states. The best model for the 4-class classification was cKNN. The highest accuracy using resting state data was 67.24%, while it was 93.10% using memory encoding state data. This study involving participants with SCD, naMCI, aMCI, and AD focused on early Alzheimer’s diagnosis. The research used EEG data during resting and memory encoding states to classify these groups, demonstrating the significance of cognitive process-related brain waves for diagnosis. The computer-based cognitive task introduced in the study offers a time-efficient alternative to traditional neuropsychological tests, showing a strong correlation with their results and serving as a valuable tool to assess cognitive impairment with reduced bias."

        "abstract": "The giant protein titin (TTN) is a sarcomeric protein that forms the myofibrillar backbone for the components of the contractile machinery which plays a crucial role in muscle disorders and cardiomyopathies. Diagnosing TTN pathogenic variants has important implications for patient management and genetic counseling. Genetic testing for TTN variants can help identify individuals at risk for developing cardiomyopathies, allowing for early intervention and personalized treatment strategies. Furthermore, identifying TTN variants can inform prognosis and guide therapeutic decisions. Deciphering the intricate genotype–phenotype correlations between TTN variants and their pathologic traits in cardiomyopathies is imperative for gene-based diagnosis, risk assessment, and personalized clinical management. With the increasing use of next-generation sequencing (NGS), a high number of variants in the TTN gene have been detected in patients with cardiomyopathies. However, not all TTN variants detected in cardiomyopathy cohorts can be assumed to be disease-causing. The interpretation of TTN variants remains challenging due to high background population variation. This narrative review aimed to comprehensively summarize current evidence on TTN variants identified in published cardiomyopathy studies and determine which specific variants are likely pathogenic contributors to cardiomyopathy development."

It is important to perform external validations of these algorithms in order to implement them. This study therefore aims to externally validate an AI algorithm’s diagnoses in real clinical practice, comparing them to a radiologist’s diagnoses. The aim is also to identify diagnoses the algorithm may not have been trained for. A prospective observational study for the external validation of the AI algorithm in a region of Catalonia, comparing the AI algorithm’s diagnosis with that of the reference radiologist, considered the gold standard. The external validation was performed with a sample of 278 images and reports, 51.8% of which showed no radiological abnormalities according to the radiologist's report. Analysing the validity of the AI algorithm, the average accuracy was 0.95 (95% CI 0.92; 0.98), the sensitivity was 0.48 (95% CI 0.30; 0.66) and the specificity was 0.98 (95% CI 0.97; 0.99). The conditions where the algorithm was most sensitive were external, upper abdominal and cardiac and/or valvular implants. On the other hand, the conditions where the algorithm was less sensitive were in the mediastinum, vessels and bone. The algorithm has been validated in the primary care setting and has proven to be useful when identifying images with or without conditions. However, in order to be a valuable tool to help and support experts, it requires additional real-world training to enhance its diagnostic capabilities for some of the conditions analysed. Our study emphasizes the need for continuous improvement to ensure the algorithm’s effectiveness in primary care."

Studies suggest that there is a relationship between a cancer patient’s gut microbiota composition and clinical response to ICB; however, defining microbiome-based biomarkers that generalize across cohorts has been challenging. This may relate to previous efforts quantifying microbiota to species (or higher taxonomic rank) abundances, whereas microbial functions are often strain specific. Here, we performed deep shotgun metagenomic sequencing of baseline fecal samples from a unique, richly annotated phase 2 trial cohort of patients with diverse rare cancers treated with combination ICB (n = 106 discovery cohort). We demonstrate that strain-resolved microbial abundances improve machine learning predictions of ICB response and 12-month progression-free survival relative to models built using species-rank quantifications or comprehensive pretreatment clinical factors. Through a meta-analysis of gut metagenomes from a further six comparable studies (n = 364 validation cohort), we found cross-cancer (and cross-country) validity of strain–response signatures, but only when the training and test cohorts used concordant ICB regimens (anti-PD-1 monotherapy or combination anti-PD-1 plus anti-CTLA-4). This suggests that future development of gut microbiome diagnostics or therapeutics should be tailored according to ICB treatment regimen rather than according to cancer type."

Our results revealed that ameloblastoma exhibits five tumor subpopulations varying with respect to immune response (IR), bone remodeling (BR), tooth development (TD), epithelial development (ED), and cell cycle (CC) signatures. Of note, we found that CC ameloblastoma cells were endowed with stemness and contributed to tumor recurrence, which was dominated by the EZH2-mediated program. Targeting EZH2 effectively eliminated CC ameloblastoma cells and inhibited tumor growth in ameloblastoma patient-derived organoids.

        "abstract": "Assessing infant carrying and holding (C/H), or physical infant-caregiver interaction, is important for a wide range of contexts in development research. An automated detection and quantification of infant C/H is particularly needed in long term at-home studies where development of infants’ neurobehavior is measured using wearable devices. Here, we first developed a phenomenological categorization for physical infant-caregiver interactions to support five different definitions of C/H behaviors. Then, we trained and assessed deep learning-based classifiers for their automatic detection from multi-sensor wearable recordings that were originally used for mobile assessment of infants’ motor development. Our results show that an automated C/H detection is feasible at few-second temporal accuracy. With the best C/H definition, the automated detector shows 96% accuracy and 0.56 kappa, which is slightly less than the video-based inter-rater agreement between trained human experts (98% accuracy, 0.77 kappa). The classifier performance varies with C/H definition reflecting the extent to which infants’ movements are present in each C/H variant. A systematic benchmarking experiment shows that the widely used actigraphy-based method ignores the normally occurring C/H behaviors. Finally, we show proof-of-concept for the utility of the novel classifier in studying C/H behavior across infant development. Particularly, we show that matching the C/H detections to individuals’ gross motor ability discloses novel insights to infant-parent interaction."

        "abstract": "Early detection of deteriorating patients is important to prevent life-threatening events and improve clinical outcomes. Efforts have been made to detect or prevent major events such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation, but previously developed tools are often complicated and time-consuming, rendering them impractical. To overcome this problem, we designed this study to create a deep learning prediction model that predicts critical events with simplified variables. This retrospective observational study included patients under the age of 18 who were admitted to the general ward of a tertiary children’s hospital between 2020 and 2022. A critical event was defined as cardiopulmonary resuscitation, unplanned transfer to the intensive care unit, or mortality. The vital signs measured during hospitalization, their measurement intervals, sex, and age were used to train a critical event prediction model. Age-specific z-scores were used to normalize the variability of the normal range by age. The entire dataset was classified into a training dataset and a test dataset at an 8:2 ratio, and model learning and testing were performed on each dataset. The predictive performance of the developed model showed excellent results, with an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.986 and an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.896. We developed a deep learning model with outstanding predictive power using simplified variables to effectively predict critical events while reducing the workload of medical staff. Nevertheless, because this was a single-center trial, no external validation was carried out, prompting further investigation."

        "abstract": "The computational pathology has been demonstrated to effectively uncover tumor-related genomic alterations and transcriptomic patterns. Although proteomics has indeed shown great potential in the field of precision medicine, few studies have focused on the computational prediction of protein levels from pathology images. In this paper, we assume that deep learning-based pathological features imply the protein levels of tumor biomarkers that are indicative of prognosis and drug response. For this purpose, we propose wsi2rppa, a weakly supervised contrastive learning framework to infer the protein levels of tumor biomarkers from whole slide images (WSIs) in breast cancer. We first conducted contrastive learning-based pre-training on tessellated tiles to extract pathological features, which are then aggregated by attention pooling and adapted to downstream tasks. We conducted extensive evaluation experiments on the TCGA-BRCA cohort (1978 WSIs of 1093 patients with protein levels of 223 biomarkers) and the CPTAC-BRCA cohort (642 WSIs of 134 patients). The results showed that our method achieved state-of-the-art performance in tumor diagnostic tasks, and also performed well in predicting clinically relevant protein levels and drug response. To show the model interpretability, we spatially visualized the WSIs colored the tiles by their attention scores, and found that the regions with high scores were highly consistent with the tumor and necrotic regions annotated by a 10-year experienced pathologist. Moreover, spatial transcriptomic data further verified that the heatmap generated by attention scores agrees greatly with the spatial expression landscape of two typical tumor biomarker genes. In predicting the response to drug trastuzumab treatment, our method achieved a 0.79 AUC value which is much higher than the previous study reported 0.68. These findings showed the remarkable potential of computational pathology in the prediction of clinically relevant protein levels, drug response, and clinical outcomes."

We performed multi-night (n = 57) at-home intracranial recordings from electrocorticography and subcortical electrodes using sensing-enabled Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS), paired with portable polysomnography in four PD participants and one with cervical dystonia (clinical trial: NCT03582891). Cortico-basal activity in delta increased and in beta decreased during NREM (N2 + N3) versus wakefulness in PD. DBS caused further elevation in cortical delta and decrease in alpha and low-beta compared to DBS OFF state. Our primary outcome demonstrated an inverse interaction between subcortical beta and cortical slow-wave during NREM. Our secondary outcome revealed subcortical beta increases prior to spontaneous awakenings in PD. We classified NREM vs. wakefulness with high accuracy in both traditional (30 s: 92.6 ± 1.7%) and rapid (5 s: 88.3 ± 2.1%) data epochs of intracranial signals. Our findings elucidate sleep neurophysiology and impacts of DBS on sleep in PD informing adaptive DBS for sleep dysfunction."

        "abstract": "Analyzing vast textual data and summarizing key information from electronic health records imposes a substantial burden on how clinicians allocate their time. Although large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, their effectiveness on a diverse range of clinical summarization tasks remains unproven. Here we applied adaptation methods to eight LLMs, spanning four distinct clinical summarization tasks: radiology reports, patient questions, progress notes and doctor–patient dialogue. Quantitative assessments with syntactic, semantic and conceptual NLP metrics reveal trade-offs between models and adaptation methods. A clinical reader study with 10 physicians evaluated summary completeness, correctness and conciseness; in most cases, summaries from our best-adapted LLMs were deemed either equivalent (45%) or superior (36%) compared with summaries from medical experts. The ensuing safety analysis highlights challenges faced by both LLMs and medical experts, as we connect errors to potential medical harm and categorize types of fabricated information. Our research provides evidence of LLMs outperforming medical experts in clinical text summarization across multiple tasks. This suggests that integrating LLMs into clinical workflows could alleviate documentation burden, allowing clinicians to focus more on patient care."

All data were taken from the fourth version of the Markets in Intensive Care Medicine (MIMIC-IV) database. Independent risk factors for death in hospitals were confirmed by regression analysis. The predictive value of the five scoring systems was evaluated by receiving operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Kaplan‒Meier curves showed the impact of acute physiology score III (APSIII) on survival and prognosis in patients with SA-ARF. Decision curve analysis (DCA) identified a scoring system with the highest net clinical benefit. ROC curve analysis showed that APS III (AUC: 0.755, 95% Cl 0.714–0.768) and Logical Organ Dysfunction System (LODS) (AUC: 0.731, 95% Cl 0.717–0.7745) were better than Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II) (AUC: 0.727, 95% CI 0.713–0.741), Oxford Acute Severity of Illness Score (OASIS) (AUC: 0.706, 95% CI 0.691–0.720) and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) (AUC: 0.606, 95% CI 0.590–0.621) in assessing in-hospital mortality. Kaplan‒Meier survival analysis patients in the high-APS III score group had a considerably poorer median survival time. The DCA curve showed that APS III may provide better clinical benefits for patients. We demonstrated that the APS III score is an excellent predictor of in-hospital mortality."

Accurate PD diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment and prognosis but can be challenging, especially at early disease stages. This study aimed to develop and evaluate an explainable deep learning model for PD classification from multimodal neuroimaging data. The model was trained using one of the largest collections of T1-weighted and diffusion-tensor magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) datasets. A total of 1264 datasets from eight different studies were collected, including 611 PD patients and 653 healthy controls (HC). These datasets were pre-processed and non-linearly registered to the MNI PD25 atlas. Six imaging maps describing the macro- and micro-structural integrity of brain tissues complemented with age and sex parameters were used to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify PD/HC subjects. Explainability of the model’s decision-making was achieved using SmoothGrad saliency maps, highlighting important brain regions. The CNN was trained using a 75%/10%/15% train/validation/test split stratified by diagnosis, sex, age, and study, achieving a ROC-AUC of 0.89, accuracy of 80.8%, specificity of 82.4%, and sensitivity of 79.1% on the test set. Saliency maps revealed that diffusion tensor imaging data, especially fractional anisotropy, was more important for the classification than T1-weighted data, highlighting subcortical regions such as the brainstem, thalamus, amygdala, hippocampus, and cortical areas. The proposed model, trained on a large multimodal MRI database, can classify PD patients and HC subjects with high accuracy and clinically reasonable explanations, suggesting that micro-structural brain changes play an essential role in the disease course."

OKC combined with basal cell carcinoma as well as skeletal and other developmental abnormalities is thought to be associated with Gorlin syndrome. Moreover, OKC needs to be differentiated from orthokeratinized odontogenic cyst and other jaw cysts. Because of the different prognosis, differential diagnosis of several cysts can contribute to clinical management. We collected 519 cases, comprising a total of 2 157 hematoxylin and eosin-stained images, to develop digital pathology-based artificial intelligence (AI) models for the diagnosis and prognosis of OKC. The Inception_v3 neural network was utilized to train and test models developed from patch-level images. Finally, whole slide image-level AI models were developed by integrating deep learning-generated pathology features with several machine learning algorithms. The AI models showed great performance in the diagnosis (AUC = 0.935, 95% CI: 0.898–0.973) and prognosis (AUC = 0.840, 95%CI: 0.751–0.930) of OKC. The advantages of multiple slides model for integrating of histopathological information are demonstrated through a comparison with the single slide model. Furthermore, the study investigates the correlation between AI features generated by deep learning and pathological findings, highlighting the interpretative potential of AI models in the pathology. Here, we have developed the robust diagnostic and prognostic models for OKC. The AI model that is based on digital pathology shows promise potential for applications in odontogenic diseases of the jaw."

We aim to adapt an established deep learning algorithm for the automatic segmentation of neonatal brains from MRI, trained on a large multi-institutional dataset for improved generalizability across image acquisition parameters. Our model, ANUBEX (automated neonatal nnU-Net brain MRI extractor), was designed using nnU-Net and was trained on a subset of participants (N = 433) enrolled in the High-dose Erythropoietin for Asphyxia and Encephalopathy (HEAL) study. We compared the performance of our model to five publicly available models (BET, BSE, CABINET, iBEATv2, ROBEX) across conventional and machine learning methods, tested on two public datasets (NIH and dHCP). We found that our model had a significantly higher Dice score on the aggregate of both data sets and comparable or significantly higher Dice scores on the NIH (low-resolution) and dHCP (high-resolution) datasets independently. ANUBEX performs similarly when trained on sequence-agnostic or motion-degraded MRI, but slightly worse on preterm brains. In conclusion, we created an automatic deep learning-based neonatal brain extraction algorithm that demonstrates accurate performance with both high- and low-resolution MRIs with fast computation time."

Deep neural networks have emerged as a promising tool to enhance this process in multiple aspects, including segmentation, classification, and registration. Nevertheless, the scarcity of annotated datasets of OCT middle ear images poses a significant hurdle to the performance of neural networks. We introduce the Dresden in vivo OCT Dataset of the Middle Ear (DIOME) featuring 43 OCT volumes from both healthy and pathological middle ears of 29 subjects. DIOME provides semantic segmentations of five crucial anatomical structures (tympanic membrane, malleus, incus, stapes and promontory), and sparse landmarks delineating the salient features of the structures. The availability of these data facilitates the training and evaluation of algorithms regarding various analysis tasks with middle ear OCT images, e.g. diagnostics."

In this study, multivariable datasets were collected from 751 college students who could be easily affected by pandemics based on the complex relationships between various mental health factors. We utilized quantum annealing (QA)-based feature selection algorithms that were executed by commercial D-Wave quantum computers to determine the changes in the relative importance of the associated factors before and after the pandemic. Multivariable linear regression (MLR) and XGBoost models were also applied to validate the QA-based algorithms. Based on the experimental results, we confirm that QA-based algorithms have comparable capabilities in factor analysis research to the MLR models that have been widely used in previous studies. Furthermore, the performance of the QA-based algorithms was validated through the important factor results from the algorithms. Pandemic-related factors (e.g., confidence in the social system) and psychological factors (e.g. decision-making in uncertain situations) were more important in post-pandemic conditions. Although the results should be validated using other mental health variables or national datasets, this study will serve as a reference for researchers regarding the use of the quantum annealing approach in factor analysis with validation through real-world survey dataset analysis."

        "abstract": "Personalized treatment strategies based on non-invasive biomarkers have potential to improve patient management in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM). The residual tumour burden after surgery in GBM patients is a prognostic imaging biomarker. However, in clinical patient management, its assessment is a manual and time-consuming process that is at risk of inter-rater variability. Furthermore, the prediction of patient outcome prior to radiotherapy may identify patient subgroups that could benefit from escalated radiotherapy doses. Therefore, in this study, we investigate the capabilities of traditional radiomics and 3D convolutional neural networks for automatic detection of the residual tumour status and to prognosticate time-to-recurrence (TTR) and overall survival (OS) in GBM using postoperative [11C] methionine positron emission tomography (MET-PET) and gadolinium-enhanced T1-w magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). On the independent test data, the 3D-DenseNet model based on MET-PET achieved the best performance for residual tumour detection, while the logistic regression model with conventional radiomics features performed best for T1c-w MRI (AUC: MET-PET 0.95, T1c-w MRI 0.78). For the prognosis of TTR and OS, the 3D-DenseNet model based on MET-PET integrated with age and MGMT status achieved the best performance (Concordance-Index: TTR 0.68, OS 0.65). In conclusion, we showed that both deep-learning and conventional radiomics have potential value for supporting image-based assessment and prognosis in GBM. After prospective validation, these models may be considered for treatment personalization."

        "abstract": "Postpartum Depression Disorder (PPDD) is a prevalent mental health condition and results in severe depression and suicide attempts in the social community. Prompt actions are crucial in tackling PPDD, which requires a quick recognition and accurate analysis of the probability factors associated with this condition. This concern requires attention. The primary aim of our research is to investigate the feasibility of anticipating an individual's mental state by categorizing individuals with depression from those without depression using a dataset consisting of text along with audio recordings from patients diagnosed with PPDD. This research proposes a hybrid PPDD framework that combines Improved Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (IBi-LSTM) with Transfer Learning (TL) based on two Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures, respectively CNN-text and CNN audio. In the proposed model, the CNN section efficiently utilizes TL to obtain crucial knowledge from text and audio characteristics, whereas the improved Bi-LSTM module combines written material and sound data to obtain intricate chronological interpersonal relationships. The proposed model incorporates an attention technique to augment the effectiveness of the Bi-LSTM scheme. An experimental analysis is conducted on the PPDD online textual and speech audio dataset collected from UCI. It includes textual features such as age, women's health tracks, medical histories, demographic information, daily life metrics, psychological evaluations, and ‘speech records’ of PPDD patients. Data pre-processing is applied to maintain the data integrity and achieve reliable model performance. The proposed model demonstrates a great performance in better precision, recall, accuracy, and F1-score over existing deep learning models, including VGG-16, Base-CNN, and CNN-LSTM. These metrics indicate the model's ability to differentiate among women at risk of PPDD vs. non-PPDD. In addition, the feature importance analysis demonstrates that specific risk factors substantially impact the prediction of PPDD. The findings of this research establish a basis for improved precision and promptness in assessing the risk of PPDD, which may ultimately result in earlier implementation of interventions and the establishment of support networks for women who are susceptible to PPDD."

These devices derive control signals from surface electromyography (measure of affected muscle electrical activity, sEMG) to drive a variety of grasping motions. However, the ability for children with congenital upper limb deficiency to actuate their affected muscles to achieve naturalistic prosthetic control is not well understood, as compared to adults or children with acquired hand loss. To address this gap, we collected sEMG data from 9 congenital one-handed participants ages 8–20 years as they envisioned and attempted to perform 10 different movements with their missing hands. Seven sEMG electrodes were adhered circumferentially around the participant’s affected and unaffected limbs and participants mirrored the attempted missing hand motions with their intact side. To analyze the collected sEMG data, we used time and frequency domain analyses. We found that for the majority of participants, attempted hand movements produced detectable and consistent muscle activity, and the capacity to achieve this was not dissimilar across the affected and unaffected sides. These data suggest that children with congenital hand absence retain a degree of control over their affected muscles, which has important implications for translating and refining advanced prosthetic control technologies for children."

These radiopacities are incidentally detected on dental panoramic radiographs taken for other reasons. In this study, we investigated the performance of a deep learning model in detecting IO using a small dataset of dental panoramic radiographs with varying contrasts and features. Two radiologists collected 175 IO-diagnosed dental panoramic radiographs from the dental school database. The dataset size is limited due to the rarity of IO, with its incidence in the Turkish population reported as 2.7% in studies. To overcome this limitation, data augmentation was performed by horizontally flipping the images, resulting in an augmented dataset of 350 panoramic radiographs. The images were annotated by two radiologists and divided into approximately 70% for training (245 radiographs), 15% for validation (53 radiographs), and 15% for testing (52 radiographs). The study employing the YOLOv5 deep learning model evaluated the results using precision, recall, F1-score, mAP (mean Average Precision), and average inference time score metrics. The training and testing processes were conducted on the Google Colab Pro virtual machine. The test process's performance criteria were obtained with a precision value of 0.981, a recall value of 0.929, an F1-score value of 0.954, and an average inference time of 25.4 ms. Although radiographs diagnosed with IO have a small dataset and exhibit different contrasts and features, it has been observed that the deep learning model provides high detection speed, accuracy, and localization results. The automatic identification of IO lesions using artificial intelligence algorithms, with high success rates, can contribute to the clinical workflow of dentists by preventing unnecessary biopsy procedure."

Many genetic conditions evade diagnosis and identification could assist with parental counselling, pregnancy management and neonatal care planning. We describe a methodology to build a shape model of the third trimester fetal face from 3D ultrasound and show how it can objectively describe morphological features and gestational-age related changes of normal fetal faces. 135 fetal face 3D ultrasound volumes (117 appropriately grown, 18 growth-restricted) of 24-34 weeks gestation were included. A 3D surface model of each face was obtained using a semi-automatic segmentation workflow. Size normalisation and rescaling was performed using a growth model giving the average size at every gestation. The model demonstrated a similar growth rate to standard head circumference reference charts. A landmark-free morphometry model was estimated to characterize shape differences using non-linear deformations of an idealized template face. Advancing gestation is associated with widening/fullness of the cheeks, contraction of the chin and deepening of the eyes. Fetal growth restriction is associated with a smaller average facial size but no morphological differences. This model may eventually be used as a reference to assist in the prenatal diagnosis of congenital anomalies with characteristic facial dysmorphisms."

An in-silico model has been developed for sirolimus drug eluted from an inflated balloon in a patient-specific arterial cross-section consisting of fibrous tissue, fibrofatty tissue, dense calcium, necrotic core, and healthy tissue. The convection-diffusion-reaction equation represents the transport of drug, while drug binding, both specific and non-specific, can be modelled as a reaction process. The Brinkman equations describe the interstitial flow in porous tissue. An image processing technique is leveraged for reconstructing the computational domain. The Marker and Cell, and Immersed Boundary Methods are used to solve the set of governing equations. The no-flux interface condition and convection do amplify the tissue content, and the regions of dense calcium and necrotic core limited to or extremely close to the interface pose a clinical threat to DCB therapy. Simulations predict the effects of the positioning and clustering of plaque components in the domain. This study demands extensive intravascular ultrasound-derived virtual histology (VH-IVUS) imaging to understand the plaque morphology and determine the relative positions of different plaque compositions about the lumen-tissue interface, which have a significant impact on arterial pharmacokinetics."

By reconciling SNOMED-CT concepts and census-level categories into a consistent hierarchy, we organised more than 250 ethnicity sub-groups including and beyond “White”, “Black”, “Asian”, “Mixed” and “Other, and found them to be distributed in proportions similar to the general population. This large observational dataset presents an algorithmic hierarchy to represent self-identified ethnicity data collected across heterogeneous healthcare settings. Accurate and easily accessible ethnicity data can lead to a better understanding of population diversity, which is important to address disparities and influence policy recommendations that can translate into better, fairer health for all."

        "abstract": "Assessment of social interactions and behavioral changes in nonhuman primates is useful for understanding brain function changes during life events and pathogenesis of neurological diseases. The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), which lives in a nuclear family like humans, is a useful model, but longitudinal automated behavioral observation of multiple animals has not been achieved. Here, we developed a Full Monitoring and Animal Identification (FulMAI) system for longitudinal detection of three-dimensional (3D) trajectories of each individual in multiple marmosets under free-moving conditions by combining video tracking, Light Detection and Ranging, and deep learning. Using this system, identification of each animal was more than 97% accurate. Location preferences and inter-individual distance could be calculated, and deep learning could detect grooming behavior. The FulMAI system allows us to analyze the natural behavior of individuals in a family over their lifetime and understand how behavior changes due to life events together with other data."

        "abstract": "The lack of data democratization and information leakage from trained models hinder the development and acceptance of robust deep learning-based healthcare solutions. This paper argues that irreversible data encoding can provide an effective solution to achieve data democratization without violating the privacy constraints imposed on healthcare data and clinical models. An ideal encoding framework transforms the data into a new space where it is imperceptible to a manual or computational inspection. However, encoded data should preserve the semantics of the original data such that deep learning models can be trained effectively. This paper hypothesizes the characteristics of the desired encoding framework and then exploits random projections and random quantum encoding to realize this framework for dense and longitudinal or time-series data. Experimental evaluation highlights that models trained on encoded time-series data effectively uphold the information bottleneck principle and hence, exhibit lesser information leakage from trained models."

        "abstract": "In the enduring challenge against disease, advancements in medical technology have empowered clinicians with novel diagnostic platforms. Whilst in some cases, a single test may provide a confident diagnosis, often additional tests are required. However, to strike a balance between diagnostic accuracy and cost-effectiveness, one must rigorously construct the clinical pathways. Here, we developed a framework to build multi-platform precision pathways in an automated, unbiased way, recommending the key steps a clinician would take to reach a diagnosis. We achieve this by developing a confidence score, used to simulate a clinical scenario, where at each stage, either a confident diagnosis is made, or another test is performed. Our framework provides a range of tools to interpret, visualize and compare the pathways, improving communication and enabling their evaluation on accuracy and cost, specific to different contexts. This framework will guide the development of novel diagnostic pathways for different diseases, accelerating the implementation of precision medicine into clinical practice."

However, predicting the need for KST in critically ill patients remains challenging. This study aimed to analyze endothelium-related biomarkers as predictors of KST need in critically ill patients with stage 2 AKI. A prospective observational study was conducted on 127 adult ICU patients with stage 2 AKI by serum creatinine only. Endothelium-related biomarkers, including vascular cell adhesion protein-1 (VCAM-1), angiopoietin (AGPT) 1 and 2, and syndecan-1, were measured. Clinical parameters and outcomes were recorded. Logistic regression models, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, continuous net reclassification improvement (NRI) and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) were used for analysis. Among the patients, 22 (17.2%) required KST within 72 h. AGPT2 and syndecan-1 levels were significantly greater in patients who progressed to the KST. Multivariate analysis revealed that AGPT2 and syndecan-1 were independently associated with the need for KST. The area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC) for AGPT2 and syndecan-1 performed better than did the constructed clinical model in predicting KST. The combination of AGPT2 and syndecan-1 improved the discrimination capacity of predicting KST beyond that of the clinical model alone. Additionally, this combination improved the classification accuracy of the NRI and IDI. AGPT2 and syndecan-1 demonstrated predictive value for the need for KST in critically ill patients with stage 2 AKI. The combination of AGPT2 and syndecan-1 alone enhanced the predictive capacity of predicting KST beyond clinical variables alone. These findings may contribute to the early identification of patients who will benefit from KST and aid in the management of AKI in critically ill patients."

We demonstrate that electronic health records from the University of California, San Francisco, followed by knowledge networks (for example, SPOKE) allow for (1) prediction of AD onset and (2) prioritization of biological hypotheses, and (3) contextualization of sex dimorphism. We trained random forest models and predicted AD onset on a cohort of 749 individuals with AD and 250,545 controls with a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic of 0.72 (7 years prior) to 0.81 (1 day prior). We further harnessed matched cohort models to identify conditions with predictive power before AD onset. Knowledge networks highlight shared genes between multiple top predictors and AD (for example, APOE, ACTB, IL6 and INS). Genetic colocalization analysis supports AD association with hyperlipidemia at the APOE locus, as well as a stronger female AD association with osteoporosis at a locus near MS4A6A. We therefore show how clinical data can be utilized for early AD prediction and identification of personalized biological hypotheses."

This retrospective study aimed to investigate the influence of stage and tumor site on survival outcomes in 284 colorectal cancer patients diagnosed between 2001 and 2017. Patients were categorized into four groups based on tumor site (colon and rectum) and disease stage (early stage and advanced stage). Demographic characteristics, treatment modalities, and survival outcomes were recorded. Bayesian survival modeling was performed using semi-competing risks illness-death models with an accelerated failure time (AFT) approach, utilizing R 4.1 software. Results demonstrated significantly higher time ratios for disease recurrence (TR = 1.712, 95% CI 1.489–2.197), mortality without recurrence (TR = 1.933, 1.480–2.510), and mortality after recurrence (TR = 1.847, 1.147–2.178) in early-stage colon cancer compared to early-stage rectal cancer. Furthermore, patients with advanced-stage rectal cancer exhibited shorter survival times for disease recurrence than patients with early-stage colon cancer. The interaction effect between the disease site and cancer stage was not significant. These findings, derived from the optimal Bayesian log-normal model for terminal and non-terminal events, highlight the importance of early detection and effective management strategies for colon cancer. Early-stage colon cancer demonstrated improved survival rates for disease recurrence, mortality without recurrence, and mortality after recurrence compared to other stages. Early intervention and comprehensive care are crucial to enhance prognosis and minimize adverse events in colon cancer patients."

However, these efforts lack an intuitive and natural sensory experience. In this study, we design and test a biomimetic neurostimulation framework inspired by nature, capable of “writing” physiologically plausible information back into the peripheral nervous system. Starting from an in-silico model of mechanoreceptors, we develop biomimetic stimulation policies. We then experimentally assess them alongside mechanical touch and common linear neuromodulations. Neural responses resulting from biomimetic neuromodulation are consistently transmitted towards dorsal root ganglion and spinal cord of cats, and their spatio-temporal neural dynamics resemble those naturally induced. We implement these paradigms within the bionic device and test it with patients (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT03350061). He we report that biomimetic neurostimulation improves mobility (primary outcome) and reduces mental effort (secondary outcome) compared to traditional approaches. The outcomes of this neuroscience-driven technology, inspired by the human body, may serve as a model for advancing assistive neurotechnologies."

        "abstract": "Brain disorders pose a substantial global health challenge, persisting as a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis is crucial for diagnosing brain disorders, but it can be challenging for medical practitioners to interpret complex EEG signals and make accurate diagnoses. To address this, our study focuses on visualizing complex EEG signals in a format easily understandable by medical professionals and deep learning algorithms. We propose a novel time–frequency (TF) transform called the Forward–Backward Fourier transform (FBFT) and utilize convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract meaningful features from TF images and classify brain disorders. We introduce the concept of eye-naked classification, which integrates domain-specific knowledge and clinical expertise into the classification process. Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of the FBFT method, achieving impressive accuracies across multiple brain disorders using CNN-based classification. Specifically, we achieve accuracies of 99.82% for epilepsy, 95.91% for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), 85.1% for murmur, and 100% for mental stress using CNN-based classification. Furthermore, in the context of naked-eye classification, we achieve accuracies of 78.6%, 71.9%, 82.7%, and 91.0% for epilepsy, AD, murmur, and mental stress, respectively. Additionally, we incorporate a mean correlation coefficient (mCC) based channel selection method to enhance the accuracy of our classification further. By combining these innovative approaches, our study enhances the visualization of EEG signals, providing medical professionals with a deeper understanding of TF medical images. This research has the potential to bridge the gap between image classification and visual medical interpretation, leading to better disease detection and improved patient care in the field of neuroscience."

Reinforcement learning has been used in consumer technology to personalize content but with limited application in healthcare. We tested a reinforcement learning program that identifies individual responsiveness (“adherence”) to text message content and personalizes messaging accordingly. We randomized 60 individuals with diabetes and glycated hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] ≥ 7.5% to reinforcement learning intervention or control (no messages). Both arms received electronic pill bottles to measure adherence. The intervention improved absolute adjusted adherence by 13.6% (95%CI: 1.7%–27.1%) versus control and was more effective in patients with HbA1c 7.5- < 9.0% (36.6%, 95%CI: 25.1%–48.2%, interaction p < 0.001). We also explored whether individual patient characteristics were associated with differential response to tested behavioral factors and unique clusters of responsiveness. Reinforcement learning may be a promising approach to improve adherence and personalize communication at scale."

        "abstract": "Air pollution has become a significant concern for human health, and its impact on influenza, has been increasingly recognized. This study aims to explore the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of the impacts of air pollution on influenza and to confirm a better method for infectious disease surveillance. Spearman correlation coefficient was used to evaluate the correlation between air pollution and the influenza case counts. VIF was used to test for collinearity among selected air pollutants. OLS regression, GWR, and STWR models were fitted to explore the potential spatiotemporal relationship between air pollution and influenza. The R2, the RSS and the AICc were used to evaluate and compare the models. In addition, the DTW and K-medoids algorithms were applied to cluster the county-level time-series coefficients. Compared with the OLS regression and GWR models, STWR model exhibits superior fit especially when the influenza outbreak changes rapidly and is able to more accurately capture the changes in different regions and time periods. We discovered that identical air pollutant factors may yield contrasting impacts on influenza within the same period in different areas of Fuzhou. NO2 and PM10 showed opposite impacts on influenza in the eastern and western areas of Fuzhou during all periods. Additionally, our investigation revealed that the relationship between air pollutant factors and influenza may exhibit temporal variations in certain regions. From 2013 to 2019, the influence coefficient of O3 on influenza epidemic intensity changed from negative to positive in the western region and from positive to negative in the eastern region. STWR model could be a useful method to explore the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of the impacts of air pollution on influenza in geospatial processes. The research findings emphasize the importance of considering spatiotemporal heterogeneity when studying the relationship between air pollution and influenza."

Non-invasive optical coherence tomography (OCT) shows structural changes in the retinal layer. OCT image evaluation necessitates retinal layer segmentation. The ability of our automated retinal layer segmentation to distinguish between normal, non-proliferative (NPDR), and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) was investigated in this study using quantifiable biomarkers such as retina layer smoothness index (SI) and area (S) in horizontal and vertical OCT images for each zone (fovea, superior, inferior, nasal, and temporal). This research includes 84 eyes from 57 individuals. The study shows a significant difference in the Area (S) of inner nuclear layer (INL) and outer nuclear layer (ONL) in the horizontal foveal zone across the three groups (p < 0.001). In the horizontal scan, there is a significant difference in the smoothness index (SI) of the inner plexiform layer (IPL) and the upper border of the outer plexiform layer (OPL) among three groups (p < 0.05). There is also a significant difference in the area (S) of the OPL in the foveal zone among the three groups (p = 0.003). The area (S) of the INL in the foveal region of horizontal slabs performed best for distinguishing diabetic patients (NPDR and PDR) from normal individuals, with an accuracy of 87.6%. The smoothness index (SI) of IPL in the nasal zone of horizontal foveal slabs was the most accurate at 97.2% in distinguishing PDR from NPDR. The smoothness index of the top border of the OPL in the nasal zone of horizontal slabs was 84.1% accurate in distinguishing NPDR from PDR. Smoothness index of IPL in the temporal zone of horizontal slabs was 89.8% accurate in identifying NPDR from PDR patients. In conclusion, optical coherence tomography can assess the smoothness index and irregularity of the inner and outer plexiform layers, particularly in the nasal and temporal regions of horizontal foveal slabs, to distinguish non-proliferative from proliferative diabetic retinopathy. The evolution of diabetic retinopathy throughout severity levels and its effects on retinal layer irregularity need more study."

        "abstract": "The aim of the study was to investigate whether morphology (i.e. compact/diffuse) of brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs) correlates with the incidence of hemorrhagic events in patients receiving Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) for unruptured bAVMs. This retrospective study included 262 adult patients with unruptured bAVMs who underwent upfront SRS. Hemorrhagic events were defined as evidence of blood on CT or MRI. The morphology of bAVMs was evaluated using automated segmentation which calculated the proportion of vessel, brain tissue, and cerebrospinal fluid in bAVMs on T2-weighted MRI. Compactness index, defined as the ratio of vessel to brain tissue, categorized bAVMs into compact and diffuse types based on the optimal cutoff. Cox proportional hazard model was used to identify the independent factors for post-SRS hemorrhage. The median clinical follow-ups was 62.1 months. Post-SRS hemorrhage occurred in 13 (5.0%) patients and one of them had two bleeds, resulting in an annual bleeding rate of 0.8%. Multivariable analysis revealed bAVM morphology (compact versus diffuse), bAVM volume, and prescribed margin dose were significant predictors. The post-SRS hemorrhage rate increased with larger bAVM volume only among the diffuse nidi (1.7 versus 14.9 versus 30.6 hemorrhage per 1000 person-years in bAVM volume < 20 cm3 versus 20–40 cm3 versus > 40 cm3; p = 0.022). The significantly higher post-SRS hemorrhage rate of Spetzler-Martin grade IV–V compared with grade I–III bAVMs (20.0 versus 3.3 hemorrhages per 1000 person-years; p = 0.001) mainly originated from the diffuse bAVMs rather than the compact subgroup (30.9 versus 4.8 hemorrhages per 1000 person-years; p = 0.035). Compact and smaller bAVMs, with higher prescribed margin dose harbor lower risks of post-SRS hemorrhage. The post-SRS hemorrhage rate exceeded 2.2% annually within the diffuse and large (> 40 cm3) bAVMs and the diffuse Spetzler-Martin IV–V bAVMs. These findings may help guide patient selection of SRS for the unruptured bAVMs."

However, methods for on-demand treatment of impaired central sensory processing are scarce. Prior invasive studies demonstrated that continuous vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) in rodents can activate the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine system to rapidly improve central sensory processing. Here, we investigated whether transcutaneous VNS improves sensory performance in humans. We conducted three sham-controlled experiments, each with 12 neurotypical adults, that measured the effects of transcutaneous VNS on metrics of auditory and visual performance, and heart rate variability (HRV). Continuous stimulation was delivered to cervical (tcVNS) or auricular (taVNS) branches of the vagus nerve while participants performed psychophysics tasks or passively viewed a display. Relative to sham stimulation, tcVNS improved auditory performance by 37% (p = 0.00052) and visual performance by 23% (p = 0.038). Participants with lower performance during sham conditions experienced larger tcVNS-evoked improvements (p = 0.0040). Lastly, tcVNS increased HRV during passive viewing, corroborating vagal engagement. No evidence for an effect of taVNS was observed. These findings validate the effectiveness of tcVNS in humans and position it as a method for on-demand interventions of impairments associated with central sensory processing dysfunction."

The data sharing among hospitals, which is crucial for training robust models, is often restricted by privacy regulations. Federated learning (FL) emerges as a solution by enabling model training across multiple hospitals while preserving data privacy. However, the deployment of FL can be resource-intensive, necessitating efficient utilization of computational and network resources. In this study, we evaluate the performance and resource efficiency of five FL algorithms in the context of COVID-19 detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in a decentralized setting. The evaluation involves varying the number of participating entities, the number of federated rounds, and the selection algorithms. Our findings indicate that the Cyclic Weight Transfer algorithm exhibits superior performance, particularly when the number of participating hospitals is limited. These insights hold practical implications for the deployment of FL algorithms in COVID-19 detection and broader medical image analysis."

        "abstract": "Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) is a clinical tool which can assess the heart's perfusion status, thereby revealing impairments in patients' cardiac function. Within the MPI modality, the acquired three-dimensional signals are typically represented as a sequence of two-dimensional grayscale tomographic images. Here, we proposed an end-to-end survival training approach for processing gray-scale MPI tomograms to generate a risk score which reflects subsequent time to cardiovascular incidents, including cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal ischemic stroke (collectively known as Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events; MACE) as well as Congestive Heart Failure (CHF). We recruited a total of 1928 patients who had undergone MPI followed by coronary interventions. Among them, 80% (n = 1540) were randomly reserved for the training and 5- fold cross-validation stage, while 20% (n = 388) were set aside for the testing stage. The end-to-end survival training can converge well in generating effective AI models via the fivefold cross-validation approach with 1540 patients. When a candidate model is evaluated using independent images, the model can stratify patients into below-median-risk (n = 194) and above-median-risk (n = 194) groups, the corresponding survival curves of the two groups have significant difference (P < 0.0001). We further stratify the above-median-risk group to the quartile 3 and 4 group (n = 97 each), and the three patient strata, referred to as the high, intermediate and low risk groups respectively, manifest statistically significant difference. Notably, the 5-year cardiovascular incident rate is less than 5% in the low-risk group (accounting for 50% of all patients), while the rate is nearly 40% in the high-risk group (accounting for 25% of all patients). Evaluation of patient subgroups revealed stronger effect size in patients with three blocked arteries (Hazard ratio [HR]: 18.377, 95% CI 3.719–90.801, p < 0.001), followed by those with two blocked vessels at HR 7.484 (95% CI 1.858–30.150; p = 0.005). Regarding stent placement, patients with a single stent displayed a HR of 4.410 (95% CI 1.399–13.904; p = 0.011). Patients with two stents show a HR of 10.699 (95% CI 2.262–50.601; p = 0.003), escalating notably to a HR of 57.446 (95% CI 1.922–1717.207; p = 0.019) for patients with three or more stents, indicating a substantial relationship between the disease severity and the predictive capability of the AI for subsequent cardiovascular inciidents. The success of the MPI AI model in stratifying patients into subgroups with distinct time-to-cardiovascular incidents demonstrated the feasibility of proposed end-to-end survival training approach."

We recently described an algorithm, trained on a large dataset from our clinical gait analysis laboratory, which produces accurate cycle-by-cycle estimates of spatiotemporal gait parameters including step timing and walking velocity. Here, we demonstrate this system generalizes well to clinical care with a validation study on prosthetic users seen in therapy and outpatient clinics. Specifically, estimated walking velocity was similar to annotated 10-m walking velocities, and cadence and foot contact times closely mirrored our wearable sensor measurements. Additionally, we found that a 2D keypoint detector pretrained on largely able-bodied individuals struggles to localize prosthetic joints, particularly for those individuals with more proximal or bilateral amputations, but after training a prosthetic-specific joint detector video-based gait analysis also works on these individuals. Further work is required to validate the other outputs from our algorithm including sagittal plane joint angles and step length.

        "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive brain tumor and is characterized by a poor prognosis and high recurrence and mortality rates. Biochanin A (BCA) exhibits promising clinical anti-tumor effects. In this study, we aimed to explore the pharmacological mechanisms by which BCA acts against GBM. Network pharmacology was employed to identify overlapping target genes between BCA and GBM. Differentially expressed genes from the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis 2 (GEPIA2) database were visualized using VolcaNose. Interactions among these overlapping genes were analyzed using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins database. Protein–protein interaction networks were constructed using Cytoscape 3.8.1. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway and Gene Ontology enrichment analyses were conducted using the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery. Survival analyses for these genes were performed using the GEPIA2 database. The Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas database was used to study the correlations between key prognostic genes. Molecular docking was confirmed using the DockThor database and visualized with PyMol software. Cell viability was assessed via the CCK-8 assay, apoptosis and the cell cycle stages were examined using flow cytometry, and protein expression was detected using western blotting. In all, 63 genes were initially identified as potential targets for BCA in treating GBM. Enrichment analysis suggested that the pharmacological mechanisms of BCA primarily involved cell cycle inhibition, induction of cell apoptosis, and immune regulation. Based on these findings, AKT1, EGFR, CASP3, and MMP9 were preliminarily predicted as key prognostic target genes for BCA in GBM treatment. Furthermore, molecular docking analysis suggested stable binding of BCA to the target protein. In vitro experiments revealed the efficacy of BCA in inhibiting GBM, with an IC50 value of 98.37 ± 2.21 μM. BCA inhibited cell proliferation, induced cell apoptosis, and arrested the cell cycle of GBM cells. Furthermore, the anti-tumor effects of BCA on U251 cells were linked to the regulation of the target protein. We utilized integrated bioinformatics analyses to predict targets and confirmed through experiments that BCA possesses remarkable anti-tumor activities. We present a novel approach for multi-target treatment of GBM using BCA."

        "abstract": "There is an urgent need to monitor the mental health of large populations, especially during crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, to timely identify the most at-risk subgroups and to design targeted prevention campaigns. We therefore developed and validated surveillance indicators related to suicidality: the monthly number of hospitalisations caused by suicide attempts and the prevalence among them of five known risks factors. They were automatically computed analysing the electronic health records of fifteen university hospitals of the Paris area, France, using natural language processing algorithms based on artificial intelligence. We evaluated the relevance of these indicators conducting a retrospective cohort study. Considering 2,911,920 records contained in a common data warehouse, we tested for changes after the pandemic outbreak in the slope of the monthly number of suicide attempts by conducting an interrupted time-series analysis. We segmented the assessment time in two sub-periods: before (August 1, 2017, to February 29, 2020) and during (March 1, 2020, to June 31, 2022) the COVID-19 pandemic. We detected 14,023 hospitalisations caused by suicide attempts. Their monthly number accelerated after the COVID-19 outbreak with an estimated trend variation reaching 3.7 (95%CI 2.1–5.3), mainly driven by an increase among girls aged 8–17 (trend variation 1.8, 95%CI 1.2–2.5). After the pandemic outbreak, acts of domestic, physical and sexual violence were more often reported (prevalence ratios: 1.3, 95%CI 1.16–1.48; 1.3, 95%CI 1.10–1.64 and 1.7, 95%CI 1.48–1.98), fewer patients died (p = 0.007) and stays were shorter (p < 0.001). Our study demonstrates that textual clinical data collected in multiple hospitals can be jointly analysed to compute timely indicators describing mental health conditions of populations. Our findings also highlight the need to better take into account the violence imposed on women, especially at early ages and in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic."

        "abstract": "Lung cancer is thought to be a genetic disease with a variety of unknown origins. Globocan2020 report tells in 2020 new cancer cases identified was 19.3 million and nearly 10.0 million died owed to cancer. GLOBOCAN envisages that the cancer cases will raised to 28.4 million in 2040. This charge is superior to the combined rates of the former generally prevalent malignancies, like breast, colorectal, and prostate cancers. For attribute selection in previous work, the information gain model was applied. Then, for lung cancer prediction, multilayer perceptron, random subspace, and sequential minimal optimization (SMO) are used. However, the total number of parameters in a multilayer perceptron can become extremely large. This is inefficient because of the duplication in such high dimensions, and SMO can become ineffective due to its calculating method and maintaining a single threshold value for prediction. To avoid these difficulties, our research presented a novel technique including Z-score normalization, levy flight cuckoo search optimization, and a weighted convolutional neural network for predicting lung cancer. This result findings show that the proposed technique is effective in precision, recall, and accuracy for the Kent Ridge Bio-Medical Dataset Repository."

        "abstract": "The past decade has seen substantial innovation in clinical trials, including new trial formats, endpoints, and others. Also there have been regulatory changes, increasing competitive pressures and other external factors which impact clinical trials. In parallel, trial timelines have increased and success rates remain stubbornly low. This has led many observers to question whether clinical trials have become overly complex and if this complexity is always needed. Here we present a large-scale analysis of protocols and other data from over 16,000 trials. Using a machine learning algorithm, we automatically assessed key features of these trials, such as number of endpoints, number of inclusion–exclusion criteria and others. Using a regression analysis we combined these features into a new metric, the Trial Complexity Score, which correlates with overall clinical trial duration. Looking at this score across different clinical phases and therapeutic areas we see substantial increases over time, suggesting that clinical trials are indeed becoming more complex. We discuss drivers of increasing trial complexity, necessary or helpful (‘good’) complexity versus unnecessary (‘bad’) complexity, and we explore mechanisms of how sponsors of clinical trials can reduce trial complexity where appropriate."

        "abstract": "Digital measures of health status captured during daily life could greatly augment current in-clinic assessments for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), to enable better assessment of disease progression and impact. This work presents results from weaRAble-PRO, a 14-day observational study, which aimed to investigate how digital health technologies (DHT), such as smartphones and wearables, could augment patient reported outcomes (PRO) to determine RA status and severity in a study of 30 moderate-to-severe RA patients, compared to 30 matched healthy controls (HC). Sensor-based measures of health status, mobility, dexterity, fatigue, and other RA specific symptoms were extracted from daily iPhone guided tests (GT), as well as actigraphy and heart rate sensor data, which was passively recorded from patients’ Apple smartwatch continuously over the study duration. We subsequently developed a machine learning (ML) framework to distinguish RA status and to estimate RA severity. It was found that daily wearable sensor-outcomes robustly distinguished RA from HC participants (F1, 0.807). Furthermore, by day 7 of the study (half-way), a sufficient volume of data had been collected to reliably capture the characteristics of RA participants. In addition, we observed that the detection of RA severity levels could be improved by augmenting standard patient reported outcomes with sensor-based features (F1, 0.833) in comparison to using PRO assessments alone (F1, 0.759), and that the combination of modalities could reliability measure continuous RA severity, as determined by the clinician-assessed RAPID-3 score at baseline (r2, 0.692; RMSE, 1.33). The ability to measure the impact of the disease during daily life—through objective and remote digital outcomes—paves the way forward to enable the development of more patient-centric and personalised measurements for use in RA clinical trials."

        "abstract": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder that requires accurate diagnosis for effective management and treatment. In this article, we propose an architecture for a convolutional neural network (CNN) that utilizes magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from the Alzheimer’s disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset to categorize AD. The network employs two separate CNN models, each with distinct filter sizes and pooling layers, which are concatenated in a classification layer. The multi-class problem is addressed across three, four, and five categories. The proposed CNN architecture achieves exceptional accuracies of 99.43%, 99.57%, and 99.13%, respectively. These high accuracies demonstrate the efficacy of the network in capturing and discerning relevant features from MRI images, enabling precise classification of AD subtypes and stages. The network architecture leverages the hierarchical nature of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers to extract both local and global patterns from the data, facilitating accurate discrimination between different AD categories. Accurate classification of AD carries significant clinical implications, including early detection, personalized treatment planning, disease monitoring, and prognostic assessment. The reported accuracy underscores the potential of the proposed CNN architecture to assist medical professionals and researchers in making precise and informed judgments regarding AD patients."

We aimed to evaluate the agreement between a portable EEG device and type I PSG in patients with OSA and examine the EEG-based arousal index’s ability to estimate apnea severity. We enrolled 77 Japanese patients with OSA who underwent simultaneous type I PSG and portable EEG monitoring. Combining pulse rate, oxygen saturation (SpO2), and EEG improved sleep staging accuracy. Bland–Altman plots, paired t-tests, and receiver operating characteristics curves were used to assess agreement and screening accuracy. Significant small biases were observed for total sleep time, sleep latency, awakening after falling asleep, sleep efficiency, N1, N2, and N3 rates, arousal index, and apnea indexes. All variables showed > 95% agreement in the Bland–Altman analysis, with interclass correlation coefficients of 0.761–0.982, indicating high inter-instrument validity. The EEG-based arousal index demonstrated sufficient power for screening AHI ≥ 15 and ≥ 30 and yielded promising results in predicting apnea severity. Portable EEG device showed strong agreement with type I PSG in patients with OSA. These suggest that patients with OSA may assess their condition at home."

We aimed to use machine learning algorithms, to identify significant predictors for the presence of xerostomia. This study is the first to predict xerostomia with salivary flow rate in elderly based on artificial intelligence. In a cross-sectional study, 829 patients with oral discomfort were enrolled, and six features (sex, age, unstimulated and stimulated salivary flow rates (UFR and SFR, respectively), number of systemic diseases, and medication usage) were used in four machine learning algorithms to predict the presence of xerostomia. The incidence of xerostomia increased with age. The SFR was significantly higher than the UFR, and the UFR and SFR were significantly correlated. The UFR, but not SFR, decreased with age significantly. In patients more than 60 years of age, the UFR had a significantly higher predictive accuracy for xerostomia than the SFR. Using machine learning algorithms with tenfold cross-validation, the prediction accuracy increased significantly. In particular, the prediction accuracy of the multilayer perceptron (MLP) algorithm that combined UFR and SFR data was significantly better than either UFR or SFR individually. Moreover, when sex, age, number of systemic diseases, and number of medications were added to the MLP model, the prediction accuracy increased from 56 to 68%."

        "abstract": "This study addresses the challenges associated with emergency department (ED) overcrowding and emphasizes the need for efficient risk stratification tools to identify high-risk patients for early intervention. While several scoring systems, often based on logistic regression (LR) models, have been proposed to indicate patient illness severity, this study aims to compare the predictive performance of ensemble learning (EL) models with LR for in-hospital mortality in the ED. A cross-sectional single-center study was conducted at the ED of Imam Reza Hospital in northeast Iran from March 2016 to March 2017. The study included adult patients with one to three levels of emergency severity index. EL models using Bagging, AdaBoost, random forests (RF), Stacking and extreme gradient boosting (XGB) algorithms, along with an LR model, were constructed. The training and validation visits from the ED were randomly divided into 80% and 20%, respectively. After training the proposed models using tenfold cross-validation, their predictive performance was evaluated. Model performance was compared using the Brier score (BS), The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC), The area and precision–recall curve (AUCPR), Hosmer–Lemeshow (H–L) goodness-of-fit test, precision, sensitivity, accuracy, F1-score, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). The study included 2025 unique patients admitted to the hospital’s ED, with a total percentage of hospital deaths at approximately 19%. In the training group and the validation group, 274 of 1476 (18.6%) and 152 of 728 (20.8%) patients died during hospitalization, respectively. According to the evaluation of the presented framework, EL models, particularly Bagging, predicted in-hospital mortality with the highest AUROC (0.839, CI (0.802–0.875)) and AUCPR = 0.64 comparable in terms of discrimination power with LR (AUROC (0.826, CI (0.787–0.864)) and AUCPR = 0.61). XGB achieved the highest precision (0.83), sensitivity (0.831), accuracy (0.842), F1-score (0.833), and the highest MCC (0.48). Additionally, the most accurate models in the unbalanced dataset belonged to RF with the lowest BS (0.128). Although all studied models overestimate mortality risk and have insufficient calibration (P > 0.05), stacking demonstrated relatively good agreement between predicted and actual mortality. EL models are not superior to LR in predicting in-hospital mortality in the ED. Both EL and LR models can be considered as screening tools to identify patients at risk of mortality."

        "abstract": "Limitations in chronic pain therapies necessitate novel interventions that are effective, accessible, and safe. Brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) provide a promising modality for targeting neuropathology underlying chronic pain by converting recorded neural activity into perceivable outputs. Recent evidence suggests that increased frontal theta power (4–7 Hz) reflects pain relief from chronic and acute pain. Further studies have suggested that vibrotactile stimulation decreases pain intensity in experimental and clinical models. This longitudinal, non-randomized, open-label pilot study's objective was to reinforce frontal theta activity in six patients with chronic upper extremity pain using a novel vibrotactile neurofeedback BCI system. Patients increased their BCI performance, reflecting thought-driven control of neurofeedback, and showed a significant decrease in pain severity (1.29 ± 0.25 MAD, p = 0.03, q = 0.05) and pain interference (1.79 ± 1.10 MAD p = 0.03, q = 0.05) scores without any adverse events. Pain relief significantly correlated with frontal theta modulation. These findings highlight the potential of BCI-mediated cortico-sensory coupling of frontal theta with vibrotactile stimulation for alleviating chronic pain."

        "abstract": "Worldwide, Cardiovascular Diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death. Patients at high cardiovascular risk require long-term follow-up for early CVDs detection. Generally, cardiac arrhythmia detection through the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal has been the basis of many studies. This technique does not provide sufficient information in addition to a high false alarm potential. In addition, the electrodes used to record the ECG signal are not suitable for long-term monitoring. Recently, the photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal has attracted great interest among scientists as it provides a non-invasive, inexpensive, and convenient source of information related to cardiac activity. In this paper, the PPG signal (online database Physio Net Challenge 2015) is used to classify different cardiac arrhythmias, namely, tachycardia, bradycardia, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular flutter/fibrillation. The PPG signals are pre-processed and analyzed utilizing various signal-processing techniques to eliminate noise and artifacts, which forms a stage of signal preparation prior to the feature extraction process. A set of 41 PPG features is used for cardiac arrhythmias' classification through the application of four machine-learning techniques, namely, Decision Trees (DT), Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNNs), and Ensembles. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique is used for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction while preserving the most important information in the data. The results show a high-throughput evaluation with an accuracy of 98.4% for the KNN technique with a sensitivity of 98.3%, 95%, 96.8%, and 99.7% for bradycardia, tachycardia, ventricular flutter/fibrillation, and ventricular tachycardia, respectively. The outcomes of this work provide a tool to correlate the properties of the PPG signal with cardiac arrhythmias and thus the early diagnosis and treatment of CVDs."

        "abstract": "If scientific research on modifiable risk factors was more accessible to the general population there is a potential to prevent disease and promote health. Mobile applications can automatically combine individual characteristics and statistical models of health to present scientific information as individually tailored visuals, and thus there is untapped potential in incorporating scientific research into apps aimed at promoting healthier lifestyles. As a proof-of-concept, we develop a statistical model of the relationship between Self-rated-health (SRH) and lifestyle-related factors, and a simple app for conveying its effects through a visualisation that sets the individual as the frame of reference. Using data from the 6th (n = 12 981, 53.4% women and 46.6% men) and 7th (n = 21 083, 52.5% women and 47.5% men) iteration of the Tromsø population survey, we fitted a mixed effects linear regression model that models mean SRH as a function of self-reported intensity and frequency of physical activity (PA), BMI, mental health symptoms (HSCL-10), smoking, support from friends, and HbA1c ≥ 6.5%. We adjusted for socioeconomic and demographic factors and comorbidity. We designed a simple proof-of-concept app to register relevant user information, and use the SRH-model to translate the present status of the user into suggestions for lifestyle changes along with predicted health effects. SRH was strongly related to modifiable health factors. The strongest modifiable predictors of SRH were mental health symptoms and PA. The mean adjusted difference in SRH between those with 10-HSCL index = 1.85 (threshold for mental distress) and HSCL-10 = 1 was 0.59 (CI 0.61–0.57). Vigorous physical activity (exercising to exhaustion ≥ 4 days/week relative to sedentary) was associated with an increase on the SRH scale of 0.64 (CI 0.56–0.73). Physical activity intensity and frequency interacted positively, with large PA-volume (frequency ⨯ intensity) being particularly predictive of high SRH. Incorporating statistical models of health into lifestyle apps have great potential for effectively communicating complex health research to a general audience. Such an approach could improve lifestyle apps by helping to make the recommendations more scientifically rigorous and personalised, and offer a more comprehensive overview of lifestyle factors and their importance."

        "abstract": "Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is a complex three-dimensional deformity of the spine, the moderate forms of which require treatment with an orthopedic brace. Existing brace design approaches rely mainly on empirical manual processes, vary considerably depending on the training and expertise of the orthotist, and do not always guarantee biomechanical effectiveness. To address these issues, we propose a new automated design method for creating bespoke nighttime braces requiring virtually no user input in the process. From standard biplanar radiographs and a surface topography torso scan, a personalized finite element model of the patient is created to simulate bracing and the resulting spine growth over the treatment period. Then, the topography of an automatically generated brace is modified and simulated over hundreds of iterations by a clinically driven optimization algorithm aiming to improve brace immediate and long-term effectiveness while respecting safety thresholds. This method was clinically tested on 17 patients prospectively recruited. The optimized braces showed a highly effective immediate correction of the thoracic and lumbar curves (70% and 90% respectively), with no modifications needed to fit the braces onto the patients. In addition, the simulated lumbar lordosis and thoracic apical rotation were improved by 5° ± 3° and 2° ± 3° respectively. Our approach distinguishes from traditional brace design as it relies solely on biomechanically validated models of the patient’s digital twin and a design strategy that is entirely abstracted from empirical knowledge. It provides clinicians with an efficient way to create effective braces without relying on lengthy manual processes and variable orthotist expertise to ensure a proper correction of scoliosis."

Multi-instance learning (MIL) is proposed as a weakly supervised machine learning method, which can automatically assess the image quality. The aim of this study was to evaluate the disparities between conventional CT (c-CT) and sFOV-CT images using a lung nodule system based on MIL and assessments from radiologists. 112 patients who underwent chest CT were retrospectively enrolled in this study between July 2021 to March 2022. After undergoing c-CT examinations, sFOV-CT images with small-field-of-view were reconstructed. Two radiologists analyzed all c-CT and sFOV-CT images, including features such as location, nodule type, size, CT values, and shape signs. Then, an MIL-based lung nodule system objectively analyzed the c-CT (c-MIL) and sFOV-CT (sFOV-MIL) to explore their differences. The signal-to-noise ratio of lungs (SNR-lung) and contrast-to-noise ratio of nodules (CNR-nodule) were calculated to evaluate the quality of CT images from another perspective. The subjective evaluation by radiologists showed that feature of minimal CT value (p = 0.019) had statistical significance between c-CT and sFOV-CT. However, most features (all with p < 0.05), except for nodule type, location, volume, mean CT value, and vacuole sign (p = 0.056–1.000), had statistical differences between c-MIL and sFOV-MIL by MIL system. The SNR-lung between c-CT and sFOV-CT had no statistical significance, while the CNR-nodule showed statistical difference (p = 0.007), and the CNR of sFOV-CT was higher than that of c-CT. In detecting the difference between c-CT and sFOV-CT, features extracted by the MIL system had more statistical differences than those evaluated by radiologists. The image quality of those two CT images was different, and the CNR-nodule of sFOV-CT was higher than that of c-CT."

HIE can lead to mortality and various acute and long-term morbidities. Improved bedside monitoring methods are needed to identify biomarkers of brain health. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) can assess resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) at the bedside. We acquired resting-state fNIRS data from 21 neonates with HIE (postmenstrual age [PMA] = 39.96), in 19 neonates the scans were acquired post-therapeutic hypothermia (TH), and from 20 term-born healthy newborns (PMA = 39.93). Twelve HIE neonates also underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) post-TH. RSFC was calculated as correlation coefficients amongst the time courses for fNIRS and fMRI data, respectively. The fNIRS and fMRI RSFC maps were comparable. RSFC patterns were then measured with graph theory metrics and compared between HIE infants and healthy controls. HIE newborns showed significantly increased clustering coefficients, network efficiency and modularity compared to controls. Using a support vector machine algorithm, RSFC features demonstrated good performance in classifying the HIE and healthy newborns in separate groups. Our results indicate the utility of fNIRS-connectivity patterns as potential biomarkers for HIE and fNIRS as a new bedside tool for newborns with HIE."

And validate the stability of the correlation in 90-days and 1-year mortality. Retrospective cohort research was conducted basing MIMIC-IV database (version 2.0). The hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (Cl) were computed using multivariate Cox regression analysis. In addition, plots of survival curves and subgroup analyzes were conducted. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were also used. 9741 participants were included in this investigation. The 90-days mortality was 32.8%, and the 1-year mortality was 42.0%. After controlling for confounders, the adjusted HRs (95% CI) for tertile 2 (2.2–3.8) and tertile 3 (> 3.8) were 1.37 (1.25–1.51) and 1.74 (1.58–1.91), respectively. The Kaplan–Meier curve analysis showed a higher probability of 90-days death in the higher APAR group. The area under the curve (AUC) of APAR was 0.674 and could reach 0.709 after combining the Oxford Acute Severity of Illness Score (OASIS). This study demonstrates that APAR is significantly related to bad clinical outcomes in sepsis."

        "abstract": "The liver is a common site for the development of metastases in colorectal cancer. Treatment selection for patients with colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) is difficult; although hepatic resection will cure a minority of CRLM patients, recurrence is common. Reliable preoperative prediction of recurrence could therefore be a valuable tool for physicians in selecting the best candidates for hepatic resection in the treatment of CRLM. It has been hypothesized that evidence for recurrence could be found via quantitative image analysis on preoperative CT imaging of the future liver remnant before resection. To investigate this hypothesis, we have collected preoperative hepatic CT scans, clinicopathologic data, and recurrence/survival data, from a large, single-institution series of patients (n = 197) who underwent hepatic resection of CRLM. For each patient, we also created segmentations of the liver, vessels, tumors, and future liver remnant. The largest of its kind, this dataset is a resource that may aid in the development of quantitative imaging biomarkers and machine learning models for the prediction of post-resection hepatic recurrence of CRLM."

        "abstract": "While large publicly available cancer cell line databases are invaluable for preclinical drug discovery and biomarker development, the association between homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) and drug sensitivity in these resources remains unclear. In this study, we comprehensively analyzed molecular profiles and drug screening data from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia. Unexpectedly, gene alterations in BRCA1/2 or homologous recombination-related genes, HRD scores, or mutational signature 3 were not positively correlated with sensitivity to platinum agents or PARP inhibitors. Rather, higher HRD scores and mutational signature 3 were significantly associated with resistance to these agents in multiple assays. These findings were consistent when analyzing exclusively breast and ovarian cancer cell lines and when using data from the COSMIC Cell Line Project. Collectively, the existing data from established cancer cell lines do not reflect the expected association between HRD status and drug response to platinum agents and PARP inhibitors in clinical tumors. This discrepancy may extend to other tumor characteristics, highlighting the importance of recognizing potential limitations in cell line data for researchers."

However, the determination of TM-interconnectivity in individual tumors is challenging and the impact on patient survival unresolved. Here, we establish a connectivity signature from single-cell RNA-sequenced (scRNA-Seq) xenografted primary glioblastoma (GB) cells using a dye uptake methodology, and validate it with recording of cellular calcium epochs and clinical correlations. Astrocyte-like and mesenchymal-like GB cells have the highest connectivity signature scores in scRNA-sequenced patient-derived xenografts and patient samples. In large GB cohorts, TM-network connectivity correlates with the mesenchymal subtype and dismal patient survival. CHI3L1 gene expression serves as a robust molecular marker of connectivity and functionally influences TM networks. The connectivity signature allows insights into brain tumor biology, provides a proof-of-principle that tumor cell TM-connectivity is relevant for patients’ prognosis, and serves as a robust prognostic biomarker."

However, because ventricular arrhythmias represent a complication following engraftment of intramyocardially injected PSC-CMs, it is necessary to provide treatment strategies to control or prevent engraftment arrhythmias (EAs). Here, we show in a porcine model of myocardial infarction and PSC-CM transplantation that EAs are mechanistically linked to cellular heterogeneity in the input PSC-CM and resultant graft. Specifically, we identify atrial and pacemaker-like cardiomyocytes as culprit arrhythmogenic subpopulations. Two unique surface marker signatures, signal regulatory protein α (SIRPA)+CD90−CD200+ and SIRPA+CD90−CD200−, identify arrhythmogenic and non-arrhythmogenic cardiomyocytes, respectively. Our data suggest that modifications to current PSC-CM-production and/or PSC-CM-selection protocols could potentially prevent EAs. We further show that pharmacologic and interventional anti-arrhythmic strategies can control and potentially abolish these arrhythmias."

Head circumference was significantly predictable at 3 and 12 months. Two of the most associated features were HM n3-polyunsaturated fatty acid C22:6n3 (docosahexaenoic acid, DHA; p = 9.6e−05) and maternal intake of fish (p = 4.1e−03), a key dietary source of DHA with established relationships to brain function. Thus, using a systems biology approach, we identified meaningful relationships between HM and brain development, which validates our statistical approach, gives credence to the novel associations we observed, and sets the foundation for further research with additional cohorts and HM analytes."

In mental healthcare, reduced treatment access for minorities is ubiquitous but remedies are sparse. Here we demonstrate that digital tools can reduce the accessibility gap by addressing several key barriers. In a multisite observational study of 129,400 patients within England’s NHS services, we evaluated the impact of a personalized artificial intelligence-enabled self-referral chatbot on patient referral volume and diversity in ethnicity, gender and sexual orientation. We found that services that used this digital solution identified substantially increased referrals (15% increase versus 6% increase in control services). Critically, this increase was particularly pronounced in minorities, such as nonbinary (179% increase) and ethnic minority individuals (29% increase). Using natural language processing to analyze qualitative feedback from 42,332 individuals, we found that the chatbot’s human-free nature and the patients’ self-realization of their need for treatment were potential drivers for the observed improvement in the diversity of access. This provides strong evidence that digital tools may help overcome the pervasive inequality in mental healthcare."

Individual data was collected from 38 villages in Indiana and Belen, including geo-referenced households and blood samples for microscopy, PCR and serological analysis. A segmented linear regression model identified significant changes in seropositivity trends among different age groups. Local Getis-Ord Gi* statistic revealed clusters of households with high (hotspots) or low (coldspots) seropositivity rates. Findings from 4000 individuals showed a seropositivity level of 2.5% (95%CI: 2.0%-3.0%) for P. falciparum and 7.8% (95%CI: 7.0%-8.7%) for P. vivax, indicating recent or historical exposure. The segmented regression showed exposure reductions in the 40–50 age group (β1 = 0.043, p = 0.003) for P. vivax and the 50–60 age group (β1 = 0.005, p = 0.010) for P. falciparum. Long and extreme distance villages from Regional Hospital of Loreto exhibited higher malaria exposure compared to proximate and medium distance villages (p < 0.001).

        "abstract": "Placenta accreta spectrum (PAS) presents a significant obstetric challenge, associated with considerable maternal and fetal-neonatal morbidity and mortality. Nevertheless, it is imperative to acknowledge that a noteworthy subset of PAS cases remains undetected until the time of delivery, thereby contributing to an augmented incidence of morbidity among the affected individuals. The delayed identification of PAS not only hinders timely intervention but also exacerbates the associated health risks for both the maternal and fetal outcomes. This underscores the urgency to innovate strategies for early PAS diagnosis. In this study, we aimed to explore plasma proteins as potential diagnostic biomarkers for PAS. Integrated transcriptome and proteomic analyses were conducted to establish a novel diagnostic approach. A cohort of 15 pregnant women diagnosed with PAS and delivering at Inonu University Faculty of Medicine between 01/04/2021 and 01/01/2023, along with a matched control group of 15 pregnant women without PAS complications, were enrolled. Plasma protein identification utilized enzymatic digestion and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry techniques. Proteomic analysis identified 228 plasma proteins, of which 85 showed significant differences (P < 0.001) between PAS and control cases. We refined this to a set of 20 proteins for model construction, resulting in a highly accurate classification model (96.9% accuracy). Notable associations were observed for proteins encoded by P01859 (Immunoglobulin heavy constant gamma 2), P02538 (Keratin type II cytoskeletal 6A), P29622 [Kallistatin (also known as Serpin A4)], P17900 (Ganglioside GM2 activator Calmodulin-like protein 5), and P01619 (Immunoglobulin kappa variable 3–20), with fold changes indicating their relevance in distinguishing PAS from control groups. In conclusion, our study has identified novel plasma proteins that could serve as potential biomarkers for early diagnosis of PAS in pregnant women. Further research and validation in larger PAS cohorts are necessary to determine the clinical utility and reliability of these proteomic biomarkers for diagnosing PAS."

We sought to apply machine learning-based models to predict risk of developing future complications in pediatric CD using ileal and colonic gene expression. Gene expression data was generated from 101 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) ileal and colonic biopsies obtained from treatment-naïve CD patients and controls. Clinical outcomes including development of strictures or fistulas and progression to surgery were analyzed using differential expression and modeled using machine learning. Differential expression analysis revealed downregulation of pathways related to inflammation and extra-cellular matrix production in patients with strictures. Machine learning-based models were able to incorporate colonic gene expression and clinical characteristics to predict outcomes with high accuracy. Models showed an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.84 for strictures, 0.83 for remission, and 0.75 for surgery. Genes with potential prognostic importance for strictures (REG1A, MMP3, and DUOX2) were not identified in single gene differential analysis but were found to have strong contributions to predictive models. Our findings in FFPE tissue support the importance of colonic gene expression and the potential for machine learning-based models in predicting outcomes for pediatric CD."

We present an open dataset containing 300 images and 3,562 manually annotated urinary cells labelled into seven classes of clinically significant cell types. It is an enriched dataset acquired from the unstained and untreated urine of patients with symptomatic UTI using a simple imaging system. We demonstrate that this dataset can be used to train a Patch U-Net, a novel deep learning architecture with a random patch generator to recognise urinary cells. Our hope is, with this dataset, UTI diagnosis will be made possible in nearly all clinical settings by using a simple imaging system which leverages advanced machine learning techniques."

Conventional domain adaptation methods suffer from inaccurate lesion region localization, large errors in feature extraction, and a large number of model parameters. To address these problems, we propose a novel domain-adaptive method WDDM to achieve abnormal identification of chest radiographic images by combining Wasserstein distance and difference measures. Specifically, our method uses BiFormer as a multi-scale feature extractor to extract deep feature representations of data samples, which focuses more on discriminant features than convolutional neural networks and Swin Transformer. In addition, based on the loss minimization of Wasserstein distance and contrast domain differences, the source domain samples closest to the target domain are selected to achieve similarity and dissimilarity across domains. Experimental results show that compared with the non-transfer method that directly uses the network trained in the source domain to classify the target domain, our method has an average AUC increase of 14.8% and above. In short, our method achieves higher classification accuracy and better generalization performance."

However, how the coordination among the various muscles necessary for sports movements is impaired in athletes with yips remains to be fully understood. This study aimed to assess whether muscle synergy analysis through non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) could identify impaired spatiotemporal muscle coordination in baseball players with throwing yips. Twenty-two college baseball players, including 12 with and 10 without yips symptoms participated in the study. Electromyographic activity was recorded from 13 ipsilateral upper extremity muscles during full-effort throwing. Muscle synergies were extracted through NMF. Cluster analysis was conducted to identify any common spatiotemporal patterns of muscle synergies in players with yips. Whether individual players with yips showed deviations in spatiotemporal patterns of muscle synergies compared with control players was also investigated. Four muscle synergies were extracted for each player, but none were specific to the yips group. However, a more detailed analysis of individual players revealed that two of the three players who presented dystonic symptoms during the experiment exhibited specific patterns that differed from those in control players. By contrast, each player whose symptoms were not reproduced during the experiment presented spatiotemporal patterns of muscle synergies similar to those of the control group. The results of this study indicate no common spatiotemporal pattern of muscle synergies specific to the yips group. Furthermore, these results suggest that the spatiotemporal pattern of muscle synergies in baseball throwing motion is not impaired in situations where symptoms are not reproduced even if the players have yips symptoms. However, muscle synergy analysis can identify the characteristics of muscle coordination of players who exhibit dystonic movements. These findings can be useful in developing personalized therapeutic strategies based on individual characteristics of yips symptoms."

In this study, OCTA 3 × 3 mm macular cubes were processed with volume-rendering techniques to measure VV in 203 eyes from 107 healthy volunteers. Generalized linear models (GLM) were constructed to assess the impact of age, gender, visual acuity (VA), spherical equivalent (SE), and axial length (AL) on VV. Overall mean VV was 0.23 ± 0.05mm3. Age and axial length showed a negative correlation with VV. However, GLM model analysis found that AL exerted the most pronounced influence on VV. No statistically significant associations were identified between gender or between left and right eyes. This is the first study to assess 3D OCTA VV and its naturally occurring variations in a large series of healthy subjects. It offers novel insights into the characterization of normal retinal vascular anatomy in healthy individuals, contributing to a valuable reference for future research in this field."

Currently used in clinical care, the Pooled Cohort Equations (PCE) are based on regression methods that predict ASCVD risk based on cross-sectional risk factor levels. Deep learning (DL) models have been developed to incorporate longitudinal data for risk prediction but its benefit for ASCVD risk prediction relative to the traditional Pooled Cohort Equations (PCE) remain unknown. Our study included 15,565 participants from four cardiovascular disease cohorts free of baseline ASCVD who were followed for adjudicated ASCVD. Ten-year ASCVD risk was calculated in the training set using our benchmark, the PCE, and a longitudinal DL model, Dynamic-DeepHit. Predictors included those incorporated in the PCE: sex, race, age, total cholesterol, high density lipid cholesterol, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, diabetes, hypertension treatment and smoking. The discrimination and calibration performance of the two models were evaluated in an overall hold-out testing dataset. Of the 15,565 participants in our dataset, 2170 (13.9%) developed ASCVD. The performance of the longitudinal DL model that incorporated 8 years of longitudinal risk factor data improved upon that of the PCE [AUROC: 0.815 (CI 0.782–0.844) vs 0.792 (CI 0.760–0.825)] and the net reclassification index was 0.385. The brier score for the DL model was 0.0514 compared with 0.0542 in the PCE.

        "abstract": "The emergence of collaborations, which standardize and combine multiple clinical databases across different regions, provide a wealthy source of data, which is fundamental for clinical prediction models, such as patient-level predictions. With the aid of such large data pools, researchers are able to develop clinical prediction models for improved disease classification, risk assessment, and beyond. To fully utilize this potential, Machine Learning (ML) methods are commonly required to process these large amounts of data on disease-specific patient cohorts. As a consequence, the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) collaborative develops a framework to facilitate the application of ML models for these standardized patient datasets by using the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM). In this study, we compare the feasibility of current web-based OHDSI approaches, namely ATLAS and “Patient-level Prediction” (PLP), against a native solution (R based) to conduct such ML-based patient-level prediction analyses in OMOP. This will enable potential users to select the most suitable approach for their investigation. Each of the applied ML solutions was individually utilized to solve the same patient-level prediction task. Both approaches went through an exemplary benchmarking analysis to assess the weaknesses and strengths of the PLP R-Package. In this work, the performance of this package was subsequently compared versus the commonly used native R-package called Machine Learning in R 3 (mlr3), and its sub-packages. The approaches were evaluated on performance, execution time, and ease of model implementation. The results show that the PLP package has shorter execution times, which indicates great scalability, as well as intuitive code implementation, and numerous possibilities for visualization. However, limitations in comparison to native packages were depicted in the implementation of specific ML classifiers (e.g., Lasso), which may result in a decreased performance for real-world prediction problems. The findings here contribute to the overall effort of developing ML-based prediction models on a clinical scale and provide a snapshot for future studies that explicitly aim to develop patient-level prediction models in OMOP CDM."

We aim to map profiles of adolescents’ smoking behaviours in a rural district in Indonesia during the COVID-19 pandemic and validate their smoking exposures using cotinine tests. This study applied an online survey followed by cotinine tests for high-school students in Gunung Kidul, Yogyakarta. The participants were asked to complete the survey and participate in a cotinine test. Univariate and multivariate regressions were performed to seek potential determinants of the smoking status and diagnostic accuracy of the cotinine test. A total of 281 participants completed the survey, with 19.6% (n = 55) and 22.8% (n = 64) being ever-smokers and current smokers. The impacts of the pandemics on their smoking behaviours were found in the urgency and numbers of daily smoked cigarettes. Univariate regression analysis revealed age, gender, learning mode, and whether father/friend smokes correlate with the adolescents’ smoking behaviours. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that the odds of planning to stop smoking were 0.01 (95% CI 0.001–0.22, p-value 0.003) for having positive attitudes towards cigarettes compared to none. Of the 65 cotinine tests, 19 tested positive, with the sensitivity and specificity of the cotinine test at 94.7% and 95.6%. The prevalence of adolescent smoking during the COVID-19 pandemic in Gunung Kidul is high, with the impacts of the pandemic on the urgency and number of cigarette smoke. There are opportunities to help them stop smoking by providing reliable quit-tobacco access and advocacy in collaboration with schools, parents, and health providers."

        "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes with hyperuricaemia may lead to gout, kidney damage, hypertension, coronary heart disease, etc., further aggravating the condition of diabetes as well as adding to the medical and financial burden. To construct a risk model for hyperuricaemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus based on artificial neural network, and to evaluate the effectiveness of the risk model to provide directions for the prevention and control of the disease in this population. From June to December 2022, 8243 patients with type 2 diabetes were recruited from six community service centers for questionnaire and physical examination. Secondly, the collected data were used to select suitable variables and based on the comparison results, logistic regression was used to screen the variable characteristics. Finally, three risk models for evaluating the risk of hyperuricaemia in type 2 diabetes mellitus were developed using an artificial neural network algorithm and evaluated for performance. A total of eleven factors affecting the development of hyperuricaemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in this study, including gender, waist circumference, diabetes medication use, diastolic blood pressure, γ-glutamyl transferase, blood urea nitrogen, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, fasting glucose and estimated glomerular filtration rate. Among the generated models, baseline & biochemical risk model had the best performance with cutoff, area under the curve, accuracy, recall, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, precision, negative predictive value, KAPPA and F1-score were 0.488, 0.744, 0.689, 0.625, 0.749, 2.489, 0.501, 0.697, 0.684, 0.375 and 0.659. In addition, its Brier score was 0.169 and the calibration curve also showed good agreement between fitting and observation. The constructed artificial neural network model has better efficacy and facilitates the reduction of the harm caused by type 2 diabetes mellitus combined with hyperuricaemia."

        "abstract": "Crowdsourcing has been used in computational pathology to generate cell and cell nuclei annotations for machine learning. Herein, we broaden its scope to the previously unsolved challenging task of glioma cell detection. This requires multiplexed immunofluorescence microscopy due to diffuse invasiveness and exceptional similarity between glioma cells and reactive astrocytes. In four pilot experiments, we iteratively developed a task design enabling high-quality annotations by crowdworkers on Amazon Mechanical Turk. We applied majority or weighted vote and validated them against ground truth in the final setting. On the base of a YOLO convolutional neural network architecture, we used these consensus labels for training with different image representations regarding colors, intensities, and immmunohistochemical marker combinations. A crowd of 712 workers defined aggregated point annotations in 235 images with an average \\(F_1\\) score of 0.627 for majority vote. The networks resulted in acceptable \\(F_1\\) scores up to 0.69 for YOLOv8 on average and indicated first evidence for transferability to images lacking tumor markers, especially in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. Our work confirms feasibility of crowdsourcing to generate labels suitable for training of machine learning tools in the challenging and clinically relevant use case of glioma microenvironment."

Here we describe a precision medicine platform known as the Molecular Twin consisting of advanced machine-learning models and use it to analyze a dataset of 6,363 clinical and multi-omic molecular features from patients with resected pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma to accurately predict disease survival (DS). We show that a full multi-omic model predicts DS with the highest accuracy and that plasma protein is the top single-omic predictor of DS. A parsimonious model learning only 589 multi-omic features demonstrated similar predictive performance as the full multi-omic model. Our platform enables discovery of parsimonious biomarker panels and performance assessment of outcome prediction models learning from resource-intensive panels. This approach has considerable potential to impact clinical care and democratize precision cancer medicine worldwide."

High-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) therapy has gained popularity for treating ARF in recent years. However, there is a limited understanding of the factors that predict HFNO failure in ARF patients. This study aimed to explore early indicators of HFNO failure in ARF patients, utilizing machine learning (ML) algorithms to more accurately pinpoint individuals at elevated risk of HFNO failure. Utilizing ML algorithms, we developed seven predictive models. Their performance was evaluated using various metrics, including the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, calibration curve, and precision recall curve. The study enrolled 700 patients, with 490 in the training group and 210 in the validation group. The overall HFNO failure rate was 14.1% among the 700 patients. The ML algorithms demonstrated robust performance in our study. This research underscores the potential of ML techniques in creating clinically relevant models for predicting HFNO outcomes in ARF patients. These models could play a pivotal role in enhancing the risk management of HFNO, leading to more patient-centered and personalized care approaches."

A diverse set of base models was trained to predict a binary outcome constructed from reported suicide, suicide attempt, and overdose diagnoses with varying choices of study design and prediction methodology. Each model used twenty cross-sectional and 190 longitudinal variables observed in eight time intervals covering 7.5 years prior to the time of prediction. Ensembles of seven base models were created and fine-tuned with ten variables expected to change with study design and outcome definition in order to predict suicide and combined outcome in a prospective cohort. The ensemble models achieved c-statistics of 0.73 on 2-year suicide risk and 0.83 on the combined outcome when predicting on a prospective cohort of \\(\\sim\\) 4.2 M veterans. The ensembles rely on nonlinear base models trained using a matched retrospective nested case-control (Rcc) study cohort and show good calibration across a diversity of subgroups, including risk strata, age, sex, race, and level of healthcare utilization. In addition, a linear Rcc base model provided a rich set of biological predictors, including indicators of suicide, substance use disorder, mental health diagnoses and treatments, hypoxia and vascular damage, and demographics."

        "abstract": "Numerous COVID-19 diagnostic imaging Artificial Intelligence (AI) studies exist. However, none of their models were of potential clinical use, primarily owing to methodological defects and the lack of implementation considerations for inference. In this study, all development processes of the deep-learning models are performed based on strict criteria of the “KAIZEN checklist”, which is proposed based on previous AI development guidelines to overcome the deficiencies mentioned above. We develop and evaluate two binary-classification deep-learning models to triage COVID-19: a slice model examining a Computed Tomography (CT) slice to find COVID-19 lesions; a series model examining a series of CT images to find an infected patient. We collected 2,400,200 CT slices from twelve emergency centers in Japan. Area Under Curve (AUC) and accuracy were calculated for classification performance. The inference time of the system that includes these two models were measured. For validation data, the slice and series models recognized COVID-19 with AUCs and accuracies of 0.989 and 0.982, 95.9% and 93.0% respectively. For test data, the models’ AUCs and accuracies were 0.958 and 0.953, 90.0% and 91.4% respectively. The average inference time per case was 2.83 s. Our deep-learning system realizes accuracy and inference speed high enough for practical use. The systems have already been implemented in four hospitals and eight are under progression. We released an application software and implementation code for free in a highly usable state to allow its use in Japan and globally."

Cardiac output (CO) monitoring might provide a solution, but CO monitors are not feasible/practical in the prehospital setting. Non-invasive ballistocardiography (BCG) measures heart contractility and tracks CO changes. This study analyzed the feasibility of estimating CO using morphological features extracted from BCG signals. In 20 healthy subjects ECG, carotid/abdominal BCG, and invasive arterial blood pressure based CO were recorded. BCG signals were adaptively processed to isolate the circulatory component from carotid (CCc) and abdominal (CCa) BCG. Then, 66 features were computed on a beat-to-beat basis to characterize amplitude/duration/area/length of the fluctuation in CCc and CCa. Subjects’ data were split into development set (75%) to select the best feature subset with which to build a machine learning model to estimate CO and validation set (25%) to evaluate model’s performance. The model showed a mean absolute error, percentage error and 95% limits of agreement of 0.83 L/min, 30.2% and − 2.18–1.89 L/min respectively in the validation set. BCG showed potential to reliably estimate/track CO. This method is a promising first step towards an automated, non-invasive and reliable CO estimator that may be tested in prehospital emergencies."

The goal was to provide recommendations on the use of wearable devices for real-world mobility analysis. Participants with Parkinson’s Disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Proximal Femoral Fracture, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Congestive Heart Failure, and healthy older adults (n = 97) were monitored in the laboratory and the real-world (2.5 h), using a lower back wearable device. Two walking speed estimation pipelines were validated across 4408/1298 (2.5 h/laboratory) detected walking bouts, compared to 4620/1365 bouts detected by a multi-sensor reference system. In the laboratory, the mean absolute error (MAE) and mean relative error (MRE) for walking speed estimation ranged from 0.06 to 0.12 m/s and − 2.1 to 14.4%, with ICCs (Intraclass correlation coefficients) between good (0.79) and excellent (0.91). Real-world MAE ranged from 0.09 to 0.13, MARE from 1.3 to 22.7%, with ICCs indicating moderate (0.57) to good (0.88) agreement. Lower errors were observed for cohorts without major gait impairments, less complex tasks, and longer walking bouts. The analytical pipelines demonstrated moderate to good accuracy in estimating walking speed. Accuracy depended on confounding factors, emphasizing the need for robust technical validation before clinical application."

        "publication_date": "18 Jan 2024",
        "abstract": "In neurorehabilitation, assessment of functional problems is essential to define optimal rehabilitation treatments. Usually, this assessment process requires distinguishing between impaired and non-impaired behavior of limbs. One of the common muscle motor disorders affecting limbs is spasticity, which is complicated to quantify objectively due to the complex nature of motor control. Thus, the lack of heterogeneous samples of patients constituting an acceptable amount of data is an obstacle which is relevant to understanding the behavior of spasticity and, consequently, quantifying it. In this article, we use the 3D creation suite Blender combined with the MBLab add-on to generate synthetic samples of human body models, aiming to be as sufficiently representative as possible to real human samples. Exporting these samples to OpenSim and performing four specific upper limb movements, we analyze the muscle behavior by simulating the six degrees of spasticity contemplated by the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS). The complete dataset of patients and movements is open-source and available for future research. This approach advocates the potential to generate synthetic data for testing and validating musculoskeletal models."

        "abstract": "Whole-mount sectioning is a technique in histopathology where a full slice of tissue, such as a transversal cross-section of a prostate specimen, is prepared on a large microscope slide without further sectioning into smaller fragments. Although this technique can offer improved correlation with pre-operative imaging and is paramount for multimodal research, it is not commonly employed due to its technical difficulty, associated cost and cumbersome integration in (digital) pathology workflows. In this work, we present a computational tool named PythoStitcher which reconstructs artificial whole-mount sections from digitized tissue fragments, thereby bringing the benefits of whole-mount sections to pathology labs currently unable to employ this technique. Our proposed algorithm consists of a multi-step approach where it (i) automatically determines how fragments need to be reassembled, (ii) iteratively optimizes the stitch using a genetic algorithm and (iii) efficiently reconstructs the final artificial whole-mount section on full resolution (0.25 µm/pixel). PythoStitcher was validated on a total of 198 cases spanning five datasets with a varying number of tissue fragments originating from different organs from multiple centers. PythoStitcher successfully reconstructed the whole-mount section in 86–100% of cases for a given dataset with a residual registration mismatch of 0.65–2.76 mm on automatically selected landmarks. It is expected that our algorithm can aid pathology labs unable to employ whole-mount sectioning through faster clinical case evaluation and improved radiology-pathology correlation workflows."

        "abstract": "Focused ultrasound (FUS) is a non-invasive and non-ionizing technique which deploys ultrasound waves to induce bio-effects. When paired with acoustically active particles such as microbubbles (MBs), it can open the blood brain barrier (BBB) to facilitate drug delivery otherwise inhibited due to the presence of BBB. One of the parameters that affects the FUS beam propagation is the beam incidence angle on the skull. Prior work by our group has shown that, as incidence angles deviate from 90°, FUS focal pressures attenuate and result in a smaller BBB opening volume. The incidence angles calculated in our prior studies were in 2D and used skull information from CT. The study presented herein develops methods to calculate incidence angle in 3D in non-human primate (NHP) skull fragments using harmonic ultrasound imaging without using ionizing radiation. Our results show that ultrasound harmonic imaging is capable of accurately depicting features such as sutures and eye-sockets of the skull. Furthermore, we were able to reproduce previously reported relationships between the incidence angle and FUS beam attenuation. We also show feasibility of performing ultrasound harmonic imaging in in-vivo non-human primates. The all-ultrasound method presented herein combined with our neuronavigation system stands to increase more widespread adoption of FUS and render it accessible by eliminating the need for CT cranial mapping."

Patients whose SLN involvement status was identified were included in our study. The dataset consisted of preoperative features, including patient features, gestational factors, laboratory data, and tumoral features. In this study, TabNet, an end-to-end deep learning model, was proposed to predict SLN involvement in breast cancer patients. We compared the accuracy of our model with results from logistic regression analysis. A total of 1832 patients with an average age of 51 ± 12 years were included in our study, of which 697 (25.5%) had SLN involvement. On average, the TabNet model achieved an accuracy of 75%, precision of 81%, specificity of 70%, sensitivity of 87%, and AUC of 0.74, while the logistic model demonstrated an accuracy of 70%, precision of 73%, specificity of 65%, sensitivity of 79%, F1 score of 73%, and AUC of 0.70 in predicting the SLN involvement in patients. Vascular invasion, tumor size, core needle biopsy pathology, age, and FH had the most contributions to the TabNet model. The TabNet model outperformed the logistic regression model in all metrics, indicating that it is more effective in predicting SLN involvement in breast cancer patients based on preoperative data."

Building upon previous research, we introduce an XAI system that provides precise and domain-specific explanations alongside its differential diagnoses of melanomas and nevi. Through a three-phase study, we assess its impact on dermatologists’ diagnostic accuracy, diagnostic confidence, and trust in the XAI-support. Our results show strong alignment between XAI and dermatologist explanations. We also show that dermatologists’ confidence in their diagnoses, and their trust in the support system significantly increase with XAI compared to conventional AI. This study highlights dermatologists’ willingness to adopt such XAI systems, promoting future use in the clinic."

In particular, nanobodies, small, single-domain antibodies that are naturally expressed in camelids, are rapidly gaining momentum following the approval of the first nanobody drug in 2019. Nonetheless, the development of these biologics as therapeutics remains a challenge. Despite the availability of established in vitro directed-evolution technologies that are relatively fast and cheap to deploy, the gold standard for generating therapeutic antibodies remains discovery from animal immunization or patients. Immune-system-derived antibodies tend to have favourable properties in vivo, including long half-life, low reactivity with self-antigens and low toxicity. Here we present AbNatiV, a deep learning tool for assessing the nativeness of antibodies and nanobodies, that is, their likelihood of belonging to the distribution of immune-system-derived human antibodies or camelid nanobodies. AbNatiV is a multipurpose tool that accurately predicts the nativeness of Fv sequences from any source, including synthetic libraries and computational design. It provides an interpretable score that predicts the likelihood of immunogenicity, and a residue-level profile that can guide the engineering of antibodies and nanobodies indistinguishable from immune-system-derived ones. We further introduce an automated humanization pipeline, which we applied to two nanobodies. Laboratory experiments show that AbNatiV-humanized nanobodies retain binding and stability at par or better than their wild type, unlike nanobodies that are humanized using conventional structural and residue-frequency analysis. We make AbNatiV available as downloadable software and as a webserver."

We identified five stable endotypes characterized by specific comorbidity profiles: Heart Failure and Arrhythmia, Healthy, Renal Failure with Hypertension, Alcohol Abuse, and Hypertension. Each endotype had distinct clinical characteristics and outcomes: The Heart Failure and Arrhythmia endotype had lower survival rates than the Renal Failure with Hypertension despite featuring fewer comorbidities overall. Patients in the Hypertension endotype had higher rates of neurosurgical intervention but shorter stays in contrast to the Alcohol Abuse endotype which had lower rates of neurosurgical intervention but significantly longer hospital stays. Both endotypes had high overall survival rates comparable to the Healthy endotype. Logistic regression models showed that endotypes improved the predictability of survival compared to individual comorbidities alone. This study validates clinical endotypes as an approach to addressing heterogeneity in TBI and demonstrates the potential of this methodology in other complex conditions."

One key prevention strategy is to follow antimicrobial stewardship practices, in particular, to maximise targeted oral therapy and reduce the use of indwelling vascular devices for intravenous (IV) administration. Appreciating when an individual patient can switch from IV to oral antibiotic treatment is often non-trivial and not standardised. To tackle this problem we created a machine learning model to predict when a patient could switch based on routinely collected clinical parameters. 10,362 unique intensive care unit stays were extracted and two informative feature sets identified. Our best model achieved a mean AUROC of 0.80 (SD 0.01) on the hold-out set while not being biased to individuals protected characteristics. Interpretability methodologies were employed to create clinically useful visual explanations. In summary, our model provides individualised, fair, and interpretable predictions for when a patient could switch from IV-to-oral antibiotic treatment. Prospectively evaluation of safety and efficacy is needed before such technology can be applied clinically."

Here, we aim to explore the implementation of modern risk stratification tools to untangle how these complex factors shape the risk of adverse events in patients with ACS. We used an interpretable multi-algorithm machine learning (ML) approach and clinical features to fit predictive models to 1,976 patients with ACS in Kuwait. We demonstrated that random forest (RF) and extreme gradient boosting (XGB) algorithms, remarkably outperform traditional logistic regression model (AUCs = 0.84 & 0.79 for RF and XGB, respectively). Our in-hospital adverse events model identified left ventricular ejection fraction as the most important predictor with the highest interaction strength with other factors. However, using the 30-days adverse events model, we found that performing an urgent coronary artery bypass graft was the most important predictor, with creatinine levels having the strongest overall interaction with other related factors. Our ML models not only untangled the non-linear relationships that shape the clinical epidemiology of ACS adverse events but also elucidated their risk in individual patients based on their unique features."

The performance was quantified at the player level using the reactive strength index modified (RSImod), at the team level by the game score (GS) metric, and finally at the conference level through Player Efficiency Rating (PER). The data includes parameters from training, subjective stress, sleep, and recovery (WHOOP straps), in-game statistics (Polar monitors), and countermovement jumps. We used data balancing techniques and an Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) classifier to predict RSI and GS with greater than 90% accuracy and a 0.9 F1 score.

We used Partial Dependence Plots to understand the impact of each feature on the target variable. Quantifying and predicting performance at all levels will allow coaches to monitor athlete readiness and help improve training."

        "abstract": "This paper demonstrates the value of a framework for processing data on body acceleration as a uniquely valuable tool for diagnosing diseases that affect gait early. As a case study, we used this model to identify individuals with peripheral artery disease (PAD) and distinguish them from those without PAD. The framework uses acceleration data extracted from anatomical reflective markers placed in different body locations to train the diagnostic models and a wearable accelerometer carried at the waist for validation. Reflective marker data have been used for decades in studies evaluating and monitoring human gait. They are widely available for many body parts but are obtained in specialized laboratories. On the other hand, wearable accelerometers enable diagnostics outside lab conditions. Models trained by raw marker data at the sacrum achieve an accuracy of 92% in distinguishing PAD patients from non-PAD controls. This accuracy drops to 28% when data from a wearable accelerometer at the waist validate the model. This model was enhanced by using features extracted from the acceleration rather than the raw acceleration, with the marker model accuracy only dropping from 86 to 60% when validated by the wearable accelerometer data."

        "abstract": "Over 6.5 million people around the world have lost their lives due to the highly contagious COVID 19 virus. The virus increases the danger of fatal health effects by damaging the lungs severely. The only method to reduce mortality and contain the spread of this disease is by promptly detecting it. Recently, deep learning has become one of the most prominent approaches to CAD, helping surgeons make more informed decisions. But deep learning models are computation hungry and devices with TPUs and GPUs are needed to run these models. The current focus of machine learning research is on developing models that can be deployed on mobile and edge devices. To this end, this research aims to develop a concise convolutional neural network-based computer-aided diagnostic system for detecting the COVID 19 virus in X-ray images, which may be deployed on devices with limited processing resources, such as mobile phones and tablets. The proposed architecture aspires to use the image enhancement in first phase and data augmentation in the second phase for image pre-processing, additionally hyperparameters are also optimized to obtain the optimal parameter settings in the third phase that provide the best results. The experimental analysis has provided empirical evidence of the impact of image enhancement, data augmentation, and hyperparameter tuning on the proposed convolutional neural network model, which increased accuracy from 94 to 98%. Results from the evaluation show that the suggested method gives an accuracy of 98%, which is better than popular transfer learning models like Xception, Resnet50, and Inception."

        "abstract": "Cochlear implants can provide an advanced treatment option to restore hearing. In standard pre-implant procedures, many factors are already considered, but it seems that not all underlying factors have been identified yet. One reason is the low quality of the conventional computed tomography images taken before implantation, making it difficult to assess these parameters. A novel method is presented that uses the Pietsch Model, a well-established model of the human cochlea, as well as landmark-based registration to address these challenges. Different landmark numbers and placements are investigated by visually comparing the mean error per landmark and the registrations’ results. The landmarks on the first cochlear turn and the apex are difficult to discern on a low-resolution CT scan. It was possible to achieve a mean error markedly smaller than the image resolution while achieving a good visual fit on a cochlear segment and directly in the conventional computed tomography image. The employed cochlear model adjusts image resolution problems, while the effort of setting landmarks is markedly less than the segmentation of the whole cochlea. As a next step, the specific parameters of the patient could be extracted from the adapted model, which enables a more personalized implantation with a presumably better outcome."

        "abstract": "Hyperglycemia is an outcome of dysregulated glucose homeostasis in the human body and may induce chronic elevation of blood glucose levels. Lifestyle factors such as overnutrition, physical inactivity, and psychosocials coupled with systemic low-grade inflammation have a strong negative impact on glucose homeostasis, in particular, insulin sensitivity. Together, these factors contribute to the pathophysiology of diabetes (DM) and expanding landscape of its prevalence regionally and globally. The rapid rise in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes, therefore, underscores the need for its early diagnosis and treatment. In this work, we have evaluated the discriminatory capacity of different diagnostic markers including inflammatory biomolecules and RBC (Red Blood Cell) indices in predicting the risk of hyperglycemia and borderline hyperglycemia. For that, 208,137 clinical diagnostic entries obtained over five years from Chugtai Labs, Pakistan, were retrospectively evaluated. The dataset included HbA1c (n = 142,011), complete blood count (CBC, n = 84,263), fasting blood glucose (FBG, n = 35,363), and C-reactive protein (CRP, n = 9035) tests. Our results provide four glycemic predictive models for two cohorts HbA1c and FBG) each having an overall predictive accuracy of more than 80% (p-value < 0.0001). Next, multivariate analysis (MANOVA) followed by univariate analysis (ANOVA) was employed to identify predictors with significant discriminatory capacity for different levels of glycemia. We show that the interplay between inflammation, hyperglycemic-induced derangements in RBC indices, and altered glucose homeostasis could be employed for prognosticating hyperglycemic outcomes. Our results then conclude a glycemic predictor with high sensitivity and specificity, employing inflammatory markers coupled with RBC indices, to predict glycemic outcomes (ROC p-value < 0.0001). Taken together, this study outlines a predictor of glycemic outcomes which could assist as a prophylactic intervention in predicting the early onset of hyperglycemia and borderline hyperglycemia."

These concerns have prompted a paradigm shift toward highly powered (that is, big data) individual-level inferences, which are data driven, transdiagnostic and neurobiologically informed. Here we built and validated supervised neuroanatomical machine learning models for individual-level inferences, using a case–control design and the largest known neuroimaging database on youth anxiety disorders: the ENIGMA-Anxiety Consortium (N = 3,343; age = 10–25 years; global sites = 32). Modest, yet robust, brain-based classifications were achieved for specific anxiety disorders (panic disorder), but also transdiagnostically for all anxiety disorders when patients were subgrouped according to their sex, medication status and symptom severity (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.59–0.63). Classifications were driven by neuroanatomical features (cortical thickness, cortical surface area and subcortical volumes) in fronto-striato-limbic and temporoparietal regions. This benchmark study within a large, heterogeneous and multisite sample of youth with anxiety disorders reveals that only modest classification performances can be realistically achieved with machine learning using neuroanatomical data."

Given that no dedicated spine surgery video datasets for AI model development are publicly available, we introduce Simulated Outcomes for Durotomy Repair in Minimally Invasive Spine Surgery (SOSpine). A validated MISS cadaveric dural repair simulator was used to educate neurosurgery residents, and surgical microscope video recordings were paired with outcome data. Objects including durotomy, needle, grasper, needle driver, and nerve hook were then annotated. Altogether, SOSpine contains 15,698 frames with 53,238 annotations and associated durotomy repair outcomes. For validation, an AI model was fine-tuned on SOSpine video and detected surgical instruments with a mean average precision of 0.77. In summary, SOSpine depicts spine surgeons managing a common complication, providing opportunities to develop surgical AI models."

Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC) is a promising technique capable of managing extensive sets of variables and non-linear relationships. Nevertheless, DEC cannot adequately handle mixed datatypes. Therefore, we adapted DEC by replacing the autoencoder with an X-shaped variational autoencoder (XVAE) and optimising hyperparameters for cluster stability. We call this model “X-DEC”. We compared DEC and X-DEC by reproducing a previous study that used DEC to identify clusters in a population of intensive care patients. We assessed internal validity based on cluster stability on the development dataset. Since generalisability of clustering models has insufficiently been validated on external populations, we assessed external validity by investigating cluster generalisability onto an external validation dataset. We concluded that both DEC and X-DEC resulted in clinically recognisable and generalisable clusters, but X-DEC produced much more stable clusters."

        "abstract": "The proposed AI-based diagnostic system aims to predict the respiratory support required for COVID-19 patients by analyzing the correlation between COVID-19 lesions and the level of respiratory support provided to the patients. Computed tomography (CT) imaging will be used to analyze the three levels of respiratory support received by the patient: Level 0 (minimum support), Level 1 (non-invasive support such as soft oxygen), and Level 2 (invasive support such as mechanical ventilation). The system will begin by segmenting the COVID-19 lesions from the CT images and creating an appearance model for each lesion using a 2D, rotation-invariant, Markov–Gibbs random field (MGRF) model. Three MGRF-based models will be created, one for each level of respiratory support. This suggests that the system will be able to differentiate between different levels of severity in COVID-19 patients. The system will decide for each patient using a neural network-based fusion system, which combines the estimates of the Gibbs energy from the three MGRF-based models. The proposed system were assessed using 307 COVID-19-infected patients, achieving an accuracy of \\(97.72\\%\\pm 1.57\\), a sensitivity of \\(97.76\\%\\pm 4.08\\), and a specificity of \\(98.87\\%\\pm 2.09\\), indicating a high level of prediction accuracy."

        "abstract": "Disease heterogeneity has been a critical challenge for precision diagnosis and treatment, especially in neurologic and neuropsychiatric diseases. Many diseases can display multiple distinct brain phenotypes across individuals, potentially reflecting disease subtypes that can be captured using MRI and machine learning methods. However, biological interpretability and treatment relevance are limited if the derived subtypes are not associated with genetic drivers or susceptibility factors. Herein, we describe Gene-SGAN – a multi-view, weakly-supervised deep clustering method – which dissects disease heterogeneity by jointly considering phenotypic and genetic data, thereby conferring genetic correlations to the disease subtypes and associated endophenotypic signatures. We first validate the generalizability, interpretability, and robustness of Gene-SGAN in semi-synthetic experiments. We then demonstrate its application to real multi-site datasets from 28,858 individuals, deriving subtypes of Alzheimer’s disease and brain endophenotypes associated with hypertension, from MRI and single nucleotide polymorphism data. Derived brain phenotypes displayed significant differences in neuroanatomical patterns, genetic determinants, biological and clinical biomarkers, indicating potentially distinct underlying neuropathologic processes, genetic drivers, and susceptibility factors. Overall, Gene-SGAN is broadly applicable to disease subtyping and endophenotype discovery, and is herein tested on disease-related, genetically-associated neuroimaging phenotypes."

This study examines the pattern of spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases across India, based on data provided by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). The research investigates temporal patterns during the first, second, and third waves in India for an informed policy response in case of any present or future pandemics. Given the colossal size of the dataset encompassing the entire nation’s data during the pandemic, a time-bound convenience sampling approach was employed. This approach was carefully designed to ensure a representative sample from advancing timeframes to observe time-based patterns in data. Data were captured from March 2020 to December 2022, with a 5-day interval considered for downloading the data. We employ robust spatial analysis techniques, including the Moran’s I index for spatial correlation assessment and the Getis Ord Gi* statistic for cluster identification. It was observed that positive COVID-19 cases in India showed a positive auto-correlation from May 2020 till December 2022. Moran’s I index values ranged from 0.11 to 0.39. It signifies a strong trend over the last 3 years with \\(r^2\\) of 0.74 on order 3 polynomial regression. It is expected that high-risk zones can have a higher number of cases in future COVID-19 waves. Monthly clusters of positive cases were mapped through ArcGIS software. Through cluster maps, high-risk zones were identified namely Kerala, Maharashtra, New Delhi, Tamil Nadu, and Gujarat. The observation is: high-risk zones mostly fall near coastal areas and hotter climatic zones, contrary to the cold Himalayan region with Montanne climate zone. Our aggregate analysis of 3 years of COVID-19 cases suggests significant patterns of interconnectedness between the Indian Railway network, climatic zones, and geographical location with COVID-19 spread. This study thereby underscores the vital role of spatiotemporal analysis in predicting and managing future COVID-19 waves as well as future pandemics for an informed policy response."

This study aims to investigate the effects of AST-120 usage on the survival of CKD patients and explore the utility of artificial intelligence models for decision-making. We conducted a retrospective analysis of CKD patients receiving care in the pre-end-stage renal disease (ESRD) program at Taichung Veterans General Hospital from 2000 to 2019. We employed Cox regression models to evaluate the relationship between AST-120 use and patient survival, both before and after propensity score matching. Subsequently, we employed Deep Neural Network (DNN) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) models to assess their performance in predicting AST-120's impact on patient survival. Among the 2584 patients in our cohort, 2199 did not use AST-120, while 385 patients received AST-120. AST-120 users exhibited significantly lower mortality rates compared to non-AST-120 users (13.51% vs. 37.88%, p < 0.0001) and a reduced prevalence of ESRD (44.16% vs. 53.17%, p = 0.0005). Propensity score matching at 1:1 and 1:2 revealed no significant differences, except for dialysis and all-cause mortality, where AST-120 users exhibited significantly lower all-cause mortality (p < 0.0001), with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.395 (95% CI = 0.295–0.522). This difference remained statistically significant even after propensity matching. In terms of model performance, the XGBoost model demonstrated the highest accuracy (0.72), specificity (0.90), and positive predictive value (0.48), while the logistic regression model showed the highest sensitivity (0.63) and negative predictive value (0.84). The area under the curve (AUC) values for logistic regression, DNN, and XGBoost were 0.73, 0.73, and 0.69, respectively, indicating similar predictive capabilities for mortality. In this cohort of CKD patients, the use of AST-120 is significantly associated with reduced mortality. However, the performance of artificial intelligence models in predicting the impact of AST-120 is not superior to statistical analysis using the current architecture and algorithm."

The AUC for detecting increased filling pressure was 0.911. The AUCs to identify diastolic dysfunction grades ≥1, ≥2, and 3 were 0.847, 0.911, and 0.943, respectively. During a median follow-up of 5.9 years, 20,223 (20.5%) died. Patients with increased filling pressure predicted by AI-ECG had higher mortality than those with normal filling pressure, after adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities in the test group (hazard ratio (HR) 1.7, 95% CI 1.645–1.757) similar to echocardiography and in the indeterminate group (HR 1.34, 95% CI 1.298–1.383). An AI-enabled ECG identifies increased filling pressure and diastolic function grades with a good prognostic value similar to echocardiography.

The present study proposes a novel and interpretable deep learning model, graph signal processing-graph convolutional networks (GSP-GCNs), using event-related EEG data obtained from a specific task involving vocal pitch regulation for PD diagnosis. By incorporating both local and global information from single-hop and multi-hop networks, our proposed GSP-GCNs models achieved an averaged classification accuracy of 90.2%, exhibiting a significant improvement of 9.5% over other deep learning models. Moreover, the interpretability analysis revealed discriminative distributions of large-scale EEG networks and topographic map of microstate MS5 learned by our models, primarily located in the left ventral premotor cortex, superior temporal gyrus, and Broca’s area that are implicated in PD-related speech disorders, reflecting our GSP-GCN models’ ability to provide interpretable insights identifying distinctive EEG biomarkers from large-scale networks. These findings demonstrate the potential of interpretable deep learning models coupled with voice-related EEG signals for distinguishing PD patients from healthy controls with accuracy and elucidating the underlying neurobiological mechanisms."

This study aims to provide a new feature fusion framework for melanoma classification that includes a novel ‘F’ Flag feature for early detection. This novel ‘F’ indicator efficiently distinguishes benign skin lesions from malignant ones known as melanoma. The article proposes an architecture that is built in a Double Decker Convolutional Neural Network called DDCNN future fusion. The network's deck one, known as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), finds difficult-to-classify hairy images using a confidence factor termed the intra-class variance score. These hirsute image samples are combined to form a Baseline Separated Channel (BSC). By eliminating hair and using data augmentation techniques, the BSC is ready for analysis. The network's second deck trains the pre-processed BSC and generates bottleneck features. The bottleneck features are merged with features generated from the ABCDE clinical bio indicators to promote classification accuracy. Different types of classifiers are fed to the resulting hybrid fused features with the novel 'F' Flag feature. The proposed system was trained using the ISIC 2019 and ISIC 2020 datasets to assess its performance. The empirical findings expose that the DDCNN feature fusion strategy for exposing malignant melanoma achieved a specificity of 98.4%, accuracy of 93.75%, precision of 98.56%, and Area Under Curve (AUC) value of 0.98. This study proposes a novel approach that can accurately identify and diagnose fatal skin cancer and outperform other state-of-the-art techniques, which is attributed to the DDCNN ‘F’ Feature fusion framework. Also, this research ascertained improvements in several classifiers when utilising the ‘F’ indicator, resulting in the highest specificity of + 7.34%."

No difference in adverse events was observed between participants with SIDD and those with SIRD. Analysis of secondary endpoints showed greater reductions in fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations in response to semaglutide in participants with SIDD than in those with SIRD and a more pronounced effect on postprandial glucose by dapagliflozin in participants with SIDD than in those with SIRD. However, no significant interaction was found between drug assignment and the SIDD or SIRD subgroup. In contrast, continuous measures of body mass index, blood pressure, insulin secretion and insulin resistance were useful in identifying those likely to have the largest improvements in glycaemic control and cardiovascular risk factors by adding semaglutide or dapagliflozin. Thus, systematic evaluation of continuous pathophysiological variables can guide the prediction of the treatment response to these drugs and provide more information than stratified subgroups (NCT04451837)."

        "abstract": "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) Thr790 Met (T790M) mutation is responsible for approximately half of the acquired resistance to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Identifying patients at diagnosis who are likely to develop this mutation after first- or second-generation EGFR-TKI treatment is crucial for better treatment outcomes. This study aims to develop and validate a radiomics-based machine learning (ML) approach to predict the T790M mutation in NSCLC patients at diagnosis. We collected retrospective data from 210 positive EGFR mutation NSCLC patients, extracting 1316 radiomics features from CT images. Using the LASSO algorithm, we selected 10 radiomics features and 2 clinical features most relevant to the mutations. We built models with 7 ML approaches and assessed their performance through the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The radiomics model and combined model, which integrated radiomics features and relevant clinical factors, achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.80 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.79–0.81) and 0.86 (0.87–0.88), respectively, in predicting the T790M mutation. Our study presents a convenient and noninvasive radiomics-based ML model for predicting this mutation at the time of diagnosis, aiding in targeted treatment planning for NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations."

        "abstract": "As a serious blood infection disease, sepsis is characterized by a high mortality risk and many complications. Accurate assessment of mortality risk of patients with sepsis can help physicians in Intensive Care Unit make optimal clinical decisions, which in turn can effectively save patients’ lives. However, most of the current clinical models used for assessing mortality risk in sepsis patients are based on conventional indicators. Unfortunately, some of the conventional indicators have been shown to be inapplicable in the accurate clinical diagnosis nowadays. Meanwhile, traditional evaluation models only focus on a small amount of personal data, causing misdiagnosis of sepsis patients. We refine the core indicators for mortality risk assessment of sepsis from massive clinical electronic medical records with machine learning, and propose a new mortality risk assessment model, DGFSD, for sepsis patients based on deep learning. The DGFSD model can not only learn individual clinical information about unassessed patients, but also obtain information about the structure of the similarity graph between diagnosed patients and patients to be assessed. Numerous experiments have shown that the accuracy of the DGFSD model is superior to baseline methods, and can significantly improve the efficiency of clinical auxiliary diagnosis."

Intraoperative and postoperative radial sectioning, the most common form of margin assessment, can lead to incomplete excision and increase the risk of recurrence and repeat procedures. Mohs Micrographic Surgery is associated with complete removal of basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma through real-time margin assessment of 100% of the peripheral and deep margins. Real-time assessment in many tumor types is constrained by tissue size, complexity, and specimen processing / assessment time during general anesthesia. We developed an artificial intelligence platform to reduce the tissue preprocessing and histological assessment time through automated grossing recommendations, mapping and orientation of tumor to the surgical specimen. Using basal cell carcinoma as a model system, results demonstrate that this approach can address surgical laboratory efficiency bottlenecks for rapid and complete intraoperative margin assessment."

There is a need to further characterize hepatic steatosis in lean patients, as its epidemiology may differ from that in overweight patients. A deep learning method determined the spleen-hepatic attenuation difference (SHAD) in Hounsfield Units (HU) on abdominal CT scans as a quantitative measure of hepatic steatosis. The patient cohort was stratified by BMI with a threshold of 25 kg/m2 and hepatic steatosis with threshold SHAD ≥  − 1 HU or liver mean attenuation ≤ 40 HU. Patient characteristics, diagnoses, and laboratory results representing metabolism and liver function were investigated. A phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) was performed for the statistical interaction between SHAD and the binary characteristic LEAN. The cohort contained 8914 patients—lean patients with (N = 278, 3.1%) and without (N = 1867, 20.9%) steatosis, and overweight patients with (N = 1863, 20.9%) and without (N = 4906, 55.0%) steatosis. Among all lean patients, those with steatosis had increased rates of cardiovascular disease (41.7 vs 27.8%), hypertension (86.7 vs 49.8%), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (29.1 vs 15.7%) (all p < 0.0001). Ten phenotypes were significant in the PheWAS, including chronic kidney disease, renal failure, and cardiovascular disease. Hepatic steatosis was found to be associated with cardiovascular, kidney, and metabolic conditions, separate from overweight BMI."

Such robust infrastructures can be financially prohibitive for investigators without substantial resources. Given the potential to develop scientific and clinical knowledge and the NIH emphasis on data sharing and reuse, there is a need for inexpensive and computationally lightweight methods for data sharing and hosting data challenges.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a widely used non-invasive method for obtaining high-contrast grayscale brain images, primarily for tumor diagnosis. The application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in deep learning has revolutionized diagnostic systems, leading to significant advancements in medical imaging interpretation. In this study, we employ a transfer learning-based fine-tuning approach using EfficientNets to classify brain tumors into three categories: glioma, meningioma, and pituitary tumors. We utilize the publicly accessible CE-MRI Figshare dataset to fine-tune five pre-trained models from the EfficientNets family, ranging from EfficientNetB0 to EfficientNetB4. Our approach involves a two-step process to refine the pre-trained EfficientNet model. First, we initialize the model with weights from the ImageNet dataset. Then, we add additional layers, including top layers and a fully connected layer, to enable tumor classification. We conduct various tests to assess the robustness of our fine-tuned EfficientNets in comparison to other pre-trained models. Additionally, we analyze the impact of data augmentation on the model's test accuracy. To gain insights into the model's decision-making, we employ Grad-CAM visualization to examine the attention maps generated by the most optimal model, effectively highlighting tumor locations within brain images. Our results reveal that using EfficientNetB2 as the underlying framework yields significant performance improvements. Specifically, the overall test accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were found to be 99.06%, 98.73%, 99.13%, and 98.79%, respectively."

Because meibomian gland dysfunction results in impaired function of the tear film lipid layer, studying the expression of tear proteins might increase the understanding of the etiology of the condition. Machine learning is able to detect patterns in complex data. This study applied machine learning to classify levels of meibomian gland dysfunction from tear proteins. The aim was to investigate proteomic changes between groups with different severity levels of meibomian gland dysfunction, as opposed to only separating patients with and without this condition. An established feature importance method was used to identify the most important proteins for the resulting models. Moreover, a new method that can take the uncertainty of the models into account when creating explanations was proposed. By examining the identified proteins, potential biomarkers for meibomian gland dysfunction were discovered. The overall findings are largely confirmatory, indicating that the presented machine learning approaches are promising for detecting clinically relevant proteins. While this study provides valuable insights into proteomic changes associated with varying severity levels of meibomian gland dysfunction, it should be noted that it was conducted without a healthy control group. Future research could benefit from including such a comparison to further validate and extend the findings presented here."

Sixty nine patients undergoing GBM resection with CDKN2A status determined by whole-exome sequencing were included. GBMs on magnetic resonance images were automatically 3D segmented using deep learning algorithms incorporated within PACS. VASARI features were assessed using FHIR forms integrated within PACS. GBMs without CDKN2A alterations were significantly larger (64 vs. 30%, p = 0.007) compared to tumors with homozygous deletion (HOMDEL) and heterozygous loss (HETLOSS). Lesions larger than 8 cm were four times more likely to have no CDKN2A alteration (OR: 4.3; 95% CI 1.5–12.1; p < 0.001). We developed a novel integrated PACS informatics platform for the assessment of GBM molecular subtypes and show that tumors with HOMDEL are more likely to have radiographic evidence of pial invasion and less likely to have deep white matter invasion or subependymal invasion. These imaging features may allow noninvasive identification of CDKN2A allele status."

Diagnosis and treatment delay can potentially lead to devastating disease complications resulting in childhood mortality. However, the application of machine learning techniques using a large data set provides scientifically sounded information to solve such palpable critical health and health-related problems. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the predictors of anemia among under-5 year’s age children in Ethiopia using a machine learning approach. A cross-sectional study design was done using the Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey 2016 data set. A two-stage stratified cluster sampling technique was employed to select the samples. The data analysis was conducted using Statistical Package for Social Sciences/SPSS version 25 and R-software. Data were derived from Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey. Boruta algorism was applied to select the features and determine the predictors of anemia among under-5 years-old children in Ethiopia. The machine learning algorism showed that number of children, distance to health facilities, health insurance coverage, youngest child’s stool disposal, residence, mothers’ wealth index, type of cooking fuel, number of family members, mothers’ educational status and receiving rotavirus vaccine were the top ten important predictors for anemia among under-five children. Machine-learning algorithm was applied to determine the predictors of anemia among under- 5 year’s age children in Ethiopia. We have identified the determinant factors by conducting a feature importance analysis with the Boruta algorithm. The most significant predictors were number of children, distance to health facility, health insurance coverage, youngest child’s stool disposal, residence, mothers’ wealth index, and type of cooking fuel.

Distinct inflammatory signatures associated with bacterial infections were spotlighted in this study. An innovation introduced in this research was the adaptation of the high-accuracy Lasso Regression model for the TI-84 calculator, with an AUC (95% CI) of 0.94 (0.925–0.955) being achieved. Using this adaptation, pivotal laboratory parameters can be input on-the-spot and infection probabilities can be computed subsequently.

We retrospectively analysed consecutive patients with renal and/or ureteral stones who underwent mini-ECIRS at three Japanese tertiary institutions. Final treatment outcome was evaluated by CT imaging at 1 month postoperatively and stone free (SF) was defined as completely no residual stone or residual stone fragments ≤ 2 mm. Three prognostic models (multiple logistic regression, classification tree analysis, and machine learning-based random forest) were developed to predict surgical outcomes using preoperative clinical factors. Clinical data from 1432 ECIRS were pooled from a database registered at three institutions, and 996 single sessions of mini-ECIRS were analysed in this study. The overall SF rate was 62.3%. The multiple logistic regression model consisted of stone burden (P < 0.001), number of involved calyces (P < 0.001), nephrostomy prior to mini-ECIRS (P = 0.091), and ECOG-PS (P = 0.110), wherein the area under the curve (AUC) was 70.7%. The classification tree analysis consisted of the number of involved calyces with an AUC of 61.7%. The random forest model showed that the top predictive variable was the number of calyces involved, with an AUC of 91.9%. Internal validation revealed that the AUCs for the multiple logistic regression model, classification tree analysis and random forest models were 70.4, 69.6 and 85.9%, respectively. The number of involved calyces, and a smaller stone burden implied a SF outcome. The machine learning-based model showed remarkably high accuracy and may be a promising tool for physicians and patients to obtain proper consent, avoid inefficient surgery, and decide preoperatively on the most efficient treatment strategies, including staged mini-ECIRS."

For regressions, the feature points lie on a high dimensional continuum having an inherently complex shape, making a meaningful visualization of the features intractable. Given that the majority of deep learning applications are regression-oriented, developing a conceptual framework and computational method to reliably visualize the regression features is of great significance. Here, we introduce a manifold discovery and analysis (MDA) method for DNN feature visualization, which involves learning the manifold topology associated with the output and target labels of a DNN. MDA leverages the acquired topological information to preserve the local geometry of the feature space manifold and provides insightful visualizations of the DNN features, highlighting the appropriateness, generalizability, and adversarial robustness of a DNN. The performance and advantages of the MDA approach compared to the existing methods are demonstrated in different deep learning applications."

LTBI individuals uniquely display ongoing immune activation and robust CD4 T cell recall responses in blood and lung. Intradermal BCG is associated with robust systemic immunity but only limited pulmonary immunity. Conversely, oral BCG induces limited systemic immunity but distinct pulmonary responses including enhanced inflammasome activation potentially associated with mucosal-associated invariant T cells.

Fractional anisotropy volume, mean fractional anisotropy, trace, axial and radial diffusivity (RD) extracted from 146 white matter parcels for each subject were used to train and test the AdaBoost classifier using stratified 12-fold cross validation. Performance was evaluated using various measures. The statistical power of the classifier was assessed using label permutation test. Statistical analysis did not yield significant differences in DTI measures between the groups. The classifier achieved a balanced accuracy of 71% and an Area Under the Receiver Operator Characteristic Curve (ROC-AUC) of 0.81 by trace, and a balanced accuracy of 70% and a ROC-AUC of 0.80 by RD, in limbic, cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop, brainstem, external and internal capsules, callosal and cerebellar structures. Both indices shared important structures for classification, while fornix was the most important structure for classification by both indices. The classifier proved statistically significant, as trace and RD ROC-AUC scores after permutation were lower than those obtained with the actual data (P = 0.022 and P = 0.024, respectively). Similar results were obtained with the Gradient Boosting classifier, whereas the RBF-kernel Support Vector Machine with k-best feature selection did not exceed the chance level. Finally, AdaBoost significantly predicted the class using all features together. Limitations are discussed.

        "abstract": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic has become a worldwide problem that continues to affect people’s lives daily, and the early diagnosis of COVID-19 has a critical importance on the treatment of infected patients for medical and healthcare organizations. To detect COVID-19 infections, medical imaging techniques, including computed tomography (CT) scan images and X-ray images, are considered some of the helpful medical tests that healthcare providers carry out. However, in addition to the difficulty of segmenting contaminated areas from CT scan images, these approaches also offer limited accuracy for identifying the virus. Accordingly, this paper addresses the effectiveness of using deep learning (DL) and image processing techniques, which serve to expand the dataset without the need for any augmentation strategies, and it also presents a novel approach for detecting COVID-19 virus infections in lung images, particularly the infection prediction issue. In our proposed method, to reveal the infection, the input images are first preprocessed using a threshold then resized to 128 × 128. After that, a density heat map tool is used for coloring the resized lung images. The three channels (red, green, and blue) are then separated from the colored image and are further preprocessed through image inverse and histogram equalization, and are subsequently fed, in independent directions, into three separate U-Nets with the same architecture for segmentation. Finally, the segmentation results are combined and run through a convolution layer one by one to get the detection. Several evaluation metrics using the CT scan dataset were used to measure the performance of the proposed approach in comparison with other state-of-the-art techniques in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, precision, and the dice coefficient. The experimental results of the proposed approach reached 99.71%, 0.83, 0.87, and 0.85, respectively. These results show that coloring the CT scan images dataset and then dividing each image into its RGB image channels can enhance the COVID-19 detection, and it also increases the U-Net power in the segmentation when merging the channel segmentation results. In comparison to other existing segmentation techniques employing bigger 512 × 512 images, this study is one of the few that can rapidly and correctly detect the COVID-19 virus with high accuracy on smaller 128 × 128 images using the metrics of accuracy, sensitivity, precision, and dice coefficient."

Early detection of voice disorders is crucial for improving voice health and quality of life. This research proposes a novel methodology called VDDMFS [voice disorder detection using MFCC (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients), fundamental frequency and spectral centroid] which combines an artificial neural network (ANN) trained on acoustic attributes and a long short-term memory (LSTM) model trained on MFCC attributes. Subsequently, the probabilities generated by both the ANN and LSTM models are stacked and used as input for XGBoost, which detects whether a voice is disordered or not, resulting in more accurate voice disorder detection. This approach achieved promising results, with an accuracy of 95.67%, sensitivity of 95.36%, specificity of 96.49% and f1 score of 96.9%, outperforming existing techniques."

        "abstract": "Despite being treatable and preventable, tuberculosis (TB) affected one-fourth of the world population in 2019, and it took the lives of 1.4 million people in 2019. It affected 1.2 million children around the world in the same year. As it is an infectious bacterial disease, the early diagnosis of TB prevents further transmission and increases the survival rate of the affected person. One of the standard diagnosis methods is the sputum culture test. Diagnosing and rapid sputum test results usually take one to eight weeks in 24 h. Using posterior-anterior chest radiographs (CXR) facilitates a rapid and more cost-effective early diagnosis of tuberculosis. Due to intraclass variations and interclass similarities in the images, TB prognosis from CXR is difficult. We proposed an early TB diagnosis system (tbXpert) based on deep learning methods. Deep Fused Linear Triangulation (FLT) is considered for CXR images to reconcile intraclass variation and interclass similarities. To improve the robustness of the prognosis approach, deep information must be obtained from the minimal radiation and uneven quality CXR images. The advanced FLT method accurately visualizes the infected region in the CXR without segmentation. Deep fused images are trained by the Deep learning network (DLN) with residual connections. The largest standard database, comprised of 3500 TB CXR images and 3500 normal CXR images, is utilized for training and validating the recommended model. Specificity, sensitivity, Accuracy, and AUC are estimated to determine the performance of the proposed systems. The proposed system demonstrates a maximum testing accuracy of 99.2%, a sensitivity of 98.9%, a specificity of 99.6%, a precision of 99.6%, and an AUC of 99.4%, all of which are pretty high when compared to current state-of-the-art deep learning approaches for the prognosis of tuberculosis. To lessen the radiologist’s time, effort, and reliance on the level of competence of the specialist, the suggested system named tbXpert can be deployed as a computer-aided diagnosis technique for tuberculosis."

However, many existing computational methods require large amounts of known DDI information, which is scarce for emerging drugs. Here we propose EmerGNN, a graph neural network that can effectively predict interactions for emerging drugs by leveraging the rich information in biomedical networks. EmerGNN learns pairwise representations of drugs by extracting the paths between drug pairs, propagating information from one drug to the other, and incorporating the relevant biomedical concepts on the paths. The edges of the biomedical network are weighted to indicate the relevance for the target DDI prediction. Overall, EmerGNN has higher accuracy than existing approaches in predicting interactions for emerging drugs and can identify the most relevant information on the biomedical network."

Traditional development of these formulations relies heavily on empirical observation to assess drug and excipient compatibility, as well as to select and optimize the formulation compositions. The aim of this work was to leverage previously developed SEDDS in the literature to construct a comprehensive SEDDS dataset that can be used to gain insights and advance data-driven approaches to formulation development. A dataset comprised of 668 unique SEDDS formulations encompassing 20 poorly water-soluble drugs was curated. While there are still opportunities to enhance the quality and quantity of data on SEDDS, this research lays the groundwork to potentially simplify the SEDDS formulation development process."

        "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterised by motor symptoms such as gait dysfunction and postural instability. Technological tools to continuously monitor outcomes could capture the hour-by-hour symptom fluctuations of PD. Development of such tools is hampered by the lack of labelled datasets from home settings. To this end, we propose REMAP (REal-world Mobility Activities in Parkinson’s disease), a human rater-labelled dataset collected in a home-like setting. It includes people with and without PD doing sit-to-stand transitions and turns in gait. These discrete activities are captured from periods of free-living (unobserved, unstructured) and during clinical assessments. The PD participants withheld their dopaminergic medications for a time (causing increased symptoms), so their activities are labelled as being “on” or “off” medications. Accelerometry from wrist-worn wearables and skeleton pose video data is included. We present an open dataset, where the data is coarsened to reduce re-identifiability, and a controlled dataset available on application which contains more refined data. A use-case for the data to estimate sit-to-stand speed and duration is illustrated."

This study aims to develop and assess the potential of machine learning in improving prehospital stroke recognition during medical helpline calls. We used calls from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2020 in Copenhagen to develop a machine learning-based classification pipeline. Calls from 2021 are used for testing. Calls are first transcribed using an automatic speech recognition model and then categorised as stroke or non-stroke using a text classification model. Call-takers achieve a sensitivity of 52.7% (95% confidence interval 49.2–56.4%) with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 17.1% (15.5–18.6%). The machine learning framework performs significantly better (p < 0.0001) with a sensitivity of 63.0% (62.0–64.1%) and a PPV of 24.9% (24.3–25.5%). Thus, a machine learning framework for recognising stroke in prehospital medical helpline calls may become a supportive tool for call-takers, aiding in early and accurate stroke recognition."

The primary aim of this study was to distinguish and classify healthy controls (HC) from participants with AD pathology in an early AD stage using an AR app. The secondary aims were to test the association of the app with clinical cognitive and functional tests and investigate the feasibility of at-home testing using AR. We furthermore investigated the test-retest reliability and potential learning effects of the task. The digital score from the AR app could significantly distinguish HC from preclinical AD (preAD) and prodromal AD (proAD), and preAD from proAD, both with in-clinic and at-home tests. For the classification of the proAD group, the digital score (AUCclinic_visit = 0.84 [0.75–0.93], AUCat_home = 0.77 [0.61–0.93]) was as good as the cognitive score (AUC = 0.85 [0.78–0.93]), while for classifying the preAD group, the digital score (AUCclinic_visit = 0.66 [0.53–0.78], AUCat_home = 0.76 [0.61–0.91]) was superior to the cognitive score (AUC = 0.55 [0.42–0.68]). In-clinic and at-home tests moderately correlated (rho = 0.57, p < 0.001). The digital score was associated with the clinical cognitive score (rho = 0.56, p < 0.001). No learning effects were found. Here we report the AR app distinguishes HC from otherwise healthy Aβ-positive individuals, both in the outpatient setting and at home, which is currently not possible with standard cognitive tests."

We also uncovered differentially expressed transcripts in subpopulations of cardiomyocytes. Finally, from this work, we were able to identify eight cardiac cell-types; several new coding, lncRNA, and pcRNA markers; two cardiomyocyte subpopulations at four different time points (ventricle E9.5, left ventricle E11.5, right ventricle E14.5 and left atrium P0) that harbored co-expressed gene modules enriched in mitochondrial, heart development and cardiovascular diseases. Our results evidence the role of particular lncRNAs in heart development and highlight the usage of co-expression modular approaches in the cell-type functional definition."

There are no data from living patients to inform whether differential gene expression of pulmonary artery ECs (PAECs) can discern disease subtypes, progression and pathogenesis. We aimed to further validate our previously described method to propagate ECs from right heart catheter (RHC) balloon tips and to perform additional PAEC phenotyping. We performed bulk RNA sequencing of PAECs from RHC balloons. Using unsupervised dimensionality reduction and clustering we compared transcriptional signatures from PAH to controls and other forms of pulmonary hypertension. Select PAEC samples underwent single cell and population growth characterization and anoikis quantification. Fifty-four specimens were analyzed from 49 subjects. The transcriptome appeared stable over limited passages. Six genes involved in sex steroid signaling, metabolism, and oncogenesis were significantly upregulated in PAH subjects as compared to controls. Genes regulating BMP and Wnt signaling, oxidative stress and cellular metabolism were differentially expressed in PAH subjects. Changes in gene expression tracked with clinical events in PAH subjects with serial samples over time. Functional assays demonstrated enhanced replication competency and anoikis resistance. Our findings recapitulate fundamental biological processes of PAH and provide new evidence of a cancer-like phenotype in ECs from the central vasculature of PAH patients. This “cell biopsy” method may provide insight into patient and lung EC heterogeneity to advance precision medicine approaches in PAH."

The quality of the modeling process and the predictive performance were evaluated in a nested cross-validation procedure using the time-dependent Brier Score and AUC at 5 years from baseline, the former measuring the overall performance including calibration and the latter highlighting the discrimination ability, with both metrics taking into account the presence of right-censoring. The best model for each metric was the componentwise gradient boosting model with a mean Brier score of 0.165 and the random survival forest model with a mean AUC of 0.773, both combined with the LASSO feature selection method."

However, due to the risk of complications, it is necessary to establish indications and selectively perform protocol biopsies by classifying the high-risk group for early subclinical rejection (SCR). Therefore, the purpose of this study is to analyze the incidence and risk factors of early SCR (within 2 weeks) and develop a prediction model using machine learning. Patients who underwent KT at Samsung Medical Center from January 2005 to December 2020 were investigated. The incidence of SCR was investigated and risk factors were analyzed. For the development of prediction model, machine learning methods (random forest, elastic net, extreme gradient boosting [XGB]) and logistic regression were used and the performance between the models was evaluated. The cohorts of 987 patients were reviewed and analyzed. The incidence of SCR was 14.6%. Borderline cellular rejection (BCR) was the most common type of rejection, accounting for 61.8% of cases. In the analysis of risk factors, recipient age (OR 0.98, p = 0.03), donor BMI (OR 1.07, p = 0.02), ABO incompatibility (OR 0.15, p < 0.001), HLA II mismatch (two [OR 6.44, p < 0.001]), and ATG induction (OR 0.41, p < 0.001) were associated with SCR in the multivariate analysis. The logistic regression prediction model (average AUC = 0.717) and the elastic net model (average AUC = 0.712) demonstrated good performance. HLA II mismatch and induction type were consistently identified as important variables in all models. The odds ratio analysis of the logistic prediction model revealed that HLA II mismatch (OR 6.77) was a risk factor for SCR, while ATG induction (OR 0.37) was a favorable factor. Early SCR was associated with HLA II mismatches and induction agent and prediction model using machine learning demonstrates the potential to predict SCR."

Data regarding clinical, behavioral and neurological features from 697 PD patients were included in our study. Our results show that the Random Forest was the classifier with the best and most consistent performance, reaching an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of up to 91.8% with only seven features. Information regarding the severity of the symptoms, the semantic verbal fluency, and the levodopa treatment were the most important for the prediction, and were further used to create a Decision Tree, whose rules may guide the pharmacological management of PD symptoms.

The aim of our study was to compare various classification approaches to differentiate MCI patients from healthy controls, based on rs-fMRI data, using machine learning (ML) algorithms. Own dataset (from two centers) and ADNI database were used during the analysis. Three fMRI parameters were applied in five feature selection algorithms: local correlation, intrinsic connectivity, and fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations. Support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) methods were applied for classification. We achieved a relatively wide range of 78–87% accuracy for the various feature selection methods with SVM combining the three rs-fMRI parameters. In the ADNI datasets case we can also see even 90% accuracy scores. RF provided a more harmonized result among the feature selection algorithms in both datasets with 80–84% accuracy for our local and 74–82% for the ADNI database. Despite some lower performance metrics of some algorithms, most of the results were positive and could be seen in two unrelated datasets which increase the validity of our methods. Our results highlight the potential of ML-based fMRI applications for automated diagnostic techniques to recognize MCI patients."

        "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a serious public health issue that affects and is responsible for numerous fatalities and impairments. Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is one of the most prevalent and deadliest types of CVDs and is responsible for 45% of all CVD-related fatalities. IHD occurs when the blood supply to the heart is reduced due to narrowed or blocked arteries, which causes angina pectoris (AP) chest pain. AP is a common symptom of IHD and can indicate a higher risk of heart attack or sudden cardiac death. Therefore, it is important to diagnose and treat AP promptly and effectively. To forecast AP in women, we constructed a novel artificial intelligence (AI) method employing the tree-based algorithm known as an Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM). EBM is a machine learning (ML) technique that combines the interpretability of linear models with the flexibility and accuracy of gradient boosting. We applied EBM to a dataset of 200 female patients, 100 with AP and 100 without AP, and extracted the most relevant features for AP prediction. We then evaluated the performance of EBM against other AI methods, such as Logistic Regression (LR), Categorical Boosting (CatBoost), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM). We found that EBM was the most accurate and well-balanced technique for forecasting AP, with accuracy (0.925) and Youden's index (0.960). We also looked at the global and local explanations provided by EBM to better understand how each feature affected the prediction and how each patient was classified. Our research showed that EBM is a useful AI method for predicting AP in women and identifying the risk factors related to it. This can help clinicians to provide personalized and evidence-based care for female patients with AP."

It is a complex, and heterogeneous disease with a multifaceted pathophysiology that remains to be elucidated. Metabolomics has the potential to identify metabolic pathways and unique biochemical profiles associated with TBI. Herein, we employed a longitudinal metabolomics approach to study TBI in a weight drop mouse model to reveal metabolic changes associated with TBI pathogenesis, severity, and secondary injury. Using proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy, we biochemically profiled post-mortem brain from mice that suffered mild TBI (N = 25; 13 male and 12 female), severe TBI (N = 24; 11 male and 13 female) and sham controls (N = 16; 11 male and 5 female) at baseline, day 1 and day 7 following the injury. 1H NMR-based metabolomics, in combination with bioinformatic analyses, highlights a few significant metabolites associated with TBI severity and perturbed metabolism related to the injury. We report that the concentrations of taurine, creatinine, adenine, dimethylamine, histidine, N-Acetyl aspartate, and glucose 1-phosphate are all associated with TBI severity. Longitudinal metabolic observation of brain tissue revealed that mild TBI and severe TBI lead distinct metabolic profile changes. A multi-class model was able to classify the severity of injury as well as time after TBI with estimated 86% accuracy. Further, we identified a high degree of correlation between respective hemisphere metabolic profiles (r > 0.84, p < 0.05, Pearson correlation). This study highlights the metabolic changes associated with underlying TBI severity and secondary injury. While comprehensive, future studies should investigate whether: (a) the biochemical pathways highlighted here are recapitulated in the brain of TBI sufferers and (b) if the panel of biomarkers are also as effective in less invasively harvested biomatrices, for objective and rapid identification of TBI severity and prognosis."

Early detection of patients who will progress to late-stage CKD is of paramount importance for patient care. To address this, we develop a pipeline to process longitudinal electronic heath records (EHRs) and construct recurrent neural network (RNN) models to predict CKD progression from stages II/III to stages IV/V. The RNN model generates predictions based on time-series records of patients, including repeated lab tests and other clinical variables. Our investigation reveals that using a single variable, the recorded estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) over time, the RNN model achieves an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.957 for predicting future CKD progression. When additional clinical variables, such as demographics, vital information, lab test results, and health behaviors, are incorporated, the average AUROC increases to 0.967. In both scenarios, the standard deviation of the AUROC across cross-validation trials is less than 0.01, indicating a stable and high prediction accuracy. Our analysis results demonstrate the proposed RNN model outperforms existing standard approaches, including static and dynamic Cox proportional hazards models, random forest, and LightGBM. The utilization of the RNN model and the time-series data of previous eGFR measurements underscores its potential as a straightforward and effective tool for assessing the clinical risk of CKD patients concerning their disease progression."

We conducted a Mendelian randomized (MR) study to explore the association between retinal thickness and PD. For the two-sample MR analysis, the summary statistics obtained from genome-wide association studies on the thickness of Retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and ganglion cell inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) were employed as exposure, while the summary statistics associated with PD were used as the outcome. The primary approach utilized was inverse variance weighted. To correct for multiple testing, the false discovery rate (FDR) was employed. For sensitivity analysis, an array of robust MR methods was utilized. We found genetically predicted significant association between reduced RNFL thickness and a reduced risk of constipation in PD (odds ratio [OR] = 0.854, 95% confidence interval [CI] (0.782, 0.933), P < 0.001, FDR-corrected P = 0.018).

The radiomics features were extracted from the T2 weighted imaging (T2WI), dynamic contrast enhanced T1 weighted imaging (DCE-T1WI), and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map and screened using the Pearson correlation coefficients (PCC). A multi-layer perceptual machine and fivefold cross-validation were used to construct the radiomics model. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves analysis, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to assess the models. The combined multi-sequence radiomics model of T2WI, DCE-T1WI, and ADC map showed better discriminatory powers than those using only one sequence. The combined radiomics models with multi-sequence fusions achieved the highest area under the ROC curve (AUC). The AUC value of the validation set was 0.852, with an accuracy of 0.827, sensitivity of 0.844, specificity of 0.773, and precision of 0.799. In conclusion, the combined multi-sequence MRI based radiomics model enables preoperative noninvasive prediction of the ki-67 expression levels in early endometrial cancer. This provides an objective imaging basis for clinical diagnosis and treatment."

        "abstract": "Of those infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), ~ 10% develop the chronic post-viral debilitating condition, long COVID (LC). Although LC is a heterogeneous condition, about half of cases have typical post-viral fatigue with onset and symptoms that are very similar to myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). A key question is whether these conditions are closely related. ME/CFS is a post-stressor fatigue condition that arises from multiple triggers. To investigate the pathophysiology of LC, a pilot study of patients (n = 6) and healthy controls (n = 5) has used quantitative proteomics to discover changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) proteins. A principal component analysis separated all long COVID patients from healthy controls. Analysis of 3131 proteins identified 162 proteins differentially regulated, of which 37 were related to immune functions, and 21 to mitochondrial functions. Markov cluster analysis identified clusters involved in immune system processes, and two aspects of gene expression-spliceosome and transcription. These results were compared with an earlier dataset of 346 differentially regulated proteins in PBMC’s from ME/CFS patients (n = 9) analysed by the same methodology. There were overlapping protein clusters and enriched molecular pathways particularly in immune functions, suggesting the two conditions have similar immune pathophysiology as a prominent feature, and mitochondrial functions involved in energy production were affected in both conditions."

        "abstract": "Postoperative desaturation is a common post-surgery pulmonary complication. The real-time prediction of postoperative desaturation can become a preventive measure, and real-time changes in spirometry data can provide valuable information on respiratory mechanics. However, there is a lack of related research, specifically on using spirometry signals as inputs to machine learning (ML) models. We developed an ML model and postoperative desaturation prediction index (DPI) by analyzing intraoperative spirometry signals in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery. We analyzed spirometry data from patients who underwent laparoscopic, robot-assisted gynecologic, or urologic surgery, identifying postoperative desaturation as a peripheral arterial oxygen saturation level below 95%, despite facial oxygen mask usage. We fitted the ML model on two separate datasets collected during different periods. (Datasets A and B). Dataset A (Normal 133, Desaturation 74) was used for the entire experimental process, including ML model fitting, statistical analysis, and DPI determination. Dataset B (Normal 20, Desaturation 4) was only used for verify the ML model and DPI. Four feature categories—signal property, inter-/intra-position correlation, peak value/interval variability, and demographics—were incorporated into the ML models via filter and wrapper feature selection methods. In experiments, the ML model achieved an adequate predictive capacity for postoperative desaturation, and the performance of the DPI was unbiased."

Longitudinal (baseline, 24 and 48-month) data, obtained from the Osteoarthritis Initiative cohort, were available for 1352 individuals, with preexisting OA (1 < Kellgren–Lawrence < 4) at baseline. KOA progression was defined as an increase in the medial joint space narrowing score from the 24-months to the 48-months control point. 16 regions of interest were automatically selected from each radiographic knee and analyzed using fractal dimension. Variations from baseline to 24 months in TBT descriptors as well as selected radiographic and clinical readings were calculated. Different logistic regression models were developed to evaluate the progression prediction performance when associating TBT variations with the selected clinical and radiographic readings. The most predictive model was mainly determined using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The proposed prediction model including short-term variations in TBT parameters, associated with clinical covariates and radiographic scores, improved the capacity of predicting long-term radiographic KOA progression (AUC of 0.739), compared to models based solely on baseline values (AUC of 0.676, p-value < 0.008)."

To this end, panoramic radiographs are used for learning by considering both local features and global information, which is important in estimating age. Transverse and longitudinal panoramic images of 9663 patients were selected (4774 males and 4889 females with a mean age of 39 years and 3 months). To compare ResNet50, ViT, and the hybrid model, the mean absolute error, mean square error, root mean square error, and coefficient of determination (R2) were used as metrics. The results confirmed that the age estimation model designed using the hybrid method performed better than those using only ResNet50 or ViT. The estimation is highly accurate for young people at an age with distinct growth characteristics. When examining the basis for age estimation in the hybrid model through attention rollout, the proposed model used logical and important factors rather than relying on unclear elements as the basis for age estimation."

        "publication_date": "09 Dec 2023",
        "abstract": "Elevated Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels are often suggestive of cholelithiasis, and previous studies have indicated that GGT is highly expressed in the urinary system. Therefore, we hypothesized that there may be an association between GGT levels and calculus of kidney (CK) incidence. To investigate this potential causal relationship, we employed Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. Additionally, we analyzed the levels of other liver enzymes, including alanine transaminase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). The relationship between GGT levels and CK incidence was analyzed using two-sample Mendelian randomization. Summary Genome-Wide Association Studies data were utilized for this analysis. 33 single nucleotide polymorphisms known to be associated with GGT levels were employed as instrumental variables. We employed several MR methods including IVW (inverse variance weighting), MR-Egger, weighted median, weighted mode, and MR-PRESSO (Mendelian Randomization Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Outlier). Furthermore, we conducted tests for horizontal multivariate validity, heterogeneity, and performed leave-one-out analysis to ensure the stability of the results. Overall, several MR methods yielded statistically significant results with a p-value < 0.05. The results from the IVW analysis yielded an odds ratio (OR) of 1.0062 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.0016–1.0109 (p = 0.0077). Additional MR methods provided supplementary results: MR-Egger (OR 1.0167, 95% CI 1.0070–1.0266, p = 0.0040); weighted median (OR 1.0058, 95% CI 1.0002–1.0115, p = 0.0423); and weighted mode (OR 1.0083, 95% CI 1.0020–1.0146, p- = 0.0188). Sensitivity analyses did not reveal heterogeneity or outliers. Although potential horizontal pleiotropy emerged, we speculate that this could be attributed to inadequate test efficacy. However, subsequent use of MR-PRESSO did not provide evidence of pleiotropy. Our analysis suggests a positive association between elevated GGT levels and CK incidence, indicating an increased risk of CK development. However, no causal relationship was observed between levels of ALP or ALT and CK incidence."

The aim of this study was to investigate General Movements (GMs) trajectories from preterm to fidgety age including GMs tendencies and their association with cognitive and motor outcome. Retrospective analysis of VPI with GMA at preterm (35 ± 2 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA), T1) and fidgety age (12 ± 3 weeks corrected age CA), T2), and BSID-III (12 ± 3 months CA, T3) is performed. Data are analysed using Pearson χ2-test, Fisher-Freeman-Halton Exact test, and residual analyses. This study found significant associations between (a) GMs (T1) and (b) persistent pathological GMs (T1 + T2) with cognitive outcomes at 12 months (T3) considering the tendencies of GMs in addition to the global character (p = 0.007, p = 0.022, respectively), representing medium-sized effects. There were no significant associations between GMs or persistence of pathological GMs and gross and fine motor outcomes, regardless of GMs tendencies. Findings indicate that considering tendencies of GMs and the persistence of pathological GMs may be important in identifying children at risk of cognitive impairments early. This additional assessment parameter may have the potential for early identification of infants with milder motor and/or cognitive impairments. However, more research is needed using larger sample cohorts to generalise the results and to be able to recommend sequential GMA for clinical routine."

        "abstract": "Over the past decade, automation of digital image analysis has become commonplace in both research and clinical settings. Spurred by recent advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML), tissue sub-compartments and cellular phenotypes within those compartments can be identified with higher throughput and accuracy than ever before. Recently, immune checkpoints have emerged as potential targets for auto-immune diseases. As such, spatial identification of these proteins along with immune cell markers (e.g., CD3+/LAG3+ T-cells) is a crucial step in understanding the potential and/or efficacy of such treatments. Here, we describe a semi-automated imaging and analysis pipeline that identifies CD3+/LAG3+ cells in colorectal tissue sub-compartments. While chromogenic staining has been a clinical mainstay and the resulting brightfield images have been utilized in AI/ML approaches in the past, there are associated drawbacks in phenotyping algorithms that can be overcome by fluorescence imaging. To address these tradeoffs, we developed an analysis pipeline combining the strengths of brightfield and fluorescence images. In this assay, immunofluorescence imaging was conducted to identify phenotypes followed by coverslip removal and hematoxylin and eosin staining of the same section to inform an AI/ML tissue segmentation algorithm. This assay proved to be robust in both tissue segmentation and phenotyping, was compatible with automated workflows, and revealed presence of LAG3+ T-cells in ulcerative colitis biopsies with spatial context preserved."

In addition, comparative data were gathered from 10 healthy patients as the control group. The training set comprised 826 images, while the validation and testing sets consisted of 91 patient images each. Validation accuracy was 97.8% over the span of 64 epochs. The model was trained for 17.3 min. For training and validation, an average loss of 0.304 and 0.358 and a final loss of 0.276 and 0.157 were noted. The testing accuracy was observed to be 93.41% with a loss of 0.221. This study proposes a novel application for rapid and reliable lagophthalmos diagnosis.

We retrospectively analyzed the CT images of 95 malignant lung nodules of the adenocarcinoma spectrum using BRODERS and CANARY. Cases were identified at Mayo Clinic (n = 45) and Vanderbilt University Medical Center and Nashville/Veteran Administration Tennessee Valley Health Care System (n = 50). Three observers with different training levels (medical student, internal medicine resident and thoracic radiology fellow) each performed lung nodule segmentation. All methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. Interclass correlation coefficients (ICC) of 0.77, 0.98 and 0.97 for the average nodule volume, BRODERS cancer probability and Score Indicative of Lesion Aggression (SILA) which summarizes the distribution of the CANARY exemplars indicated good to excellent reliability, respectively. The dice similarity coefficient was 0.79 and 0.81 for the data sets from the two institutions. BRODERS and CANARY are robust radiomics tools with excellent interobserver variability. These tools are simple and reliable regardless the observer/operator’s level of training."

In line with these inherent aggressive characteristics, only a subset of patients shows a clinical response to the standard of care therapies, thereby highlighting the need for a more personalized treatment approach. In this study, we comprehensively unraveled the intra-patient response heterogeneity and intrinsic aggressive nature of PDAC on bulk and single-organoid resolution. We leveraged a fully characterized PDAC organoid panel (N = 8) and matched our artificial intelligence-driven, live-cell organoid image analysis with retrospective clinical patient response. In line with the clinical outcomes, we identified patient-specific sensitivities to the standard of care therapies (gemcitabine-paclitaxel and FOLFIRINOX) using a growth rate-based and normalized drug response metric. Moreover, the single-organoid analysis was able to detect resistant as well as invasive PDAC organoid clones, which was orchestrates on a patient, therapy, drug, concentration and time-specific level. Furthermore, our in vitro organoid analysis indicated a correlation with the matched patient progression-free survival (PFS) compared to the current, conventional drug response readouts. This work not only provides valuable insights on the response complexity in PDAC, but it also highlights the potential applications (extendable to other tumor types) and clinical translatability of our approach in drug discovery and the emerging era of personalized medicine."

A neural network was trained to simultaneously predict vergence and accommodation using data collected from 9 subjects. We demonstrated that the use of Purkinje reflection coordinates in machine learning resulted in precise estimation. The proposed system accurately predicted the accommodation with an accuracy better than 0.22 D using subject’s own data and 0.40 D using other subjects’ data with two-point calibration in tests performed with 9 subjects in our setup."

Such deconvolution is difficult to achieve because it requires tracking patients throughout their entire lives. Here, we used machine learning to infer health trajectories over the entire adulthood age range using extrapolation from electronic medical records with partial longitudinal coverage. Using this approach, our model tracked the state of patients who were healthy and free from known chronic disease risk and distinguished individuals with higher or lower longevity potential using a multivariate score. We showed that the model and the markers it uses performed consistently on data from Israeli, British and US populations. For example, mildly low neutrophil counts and alkaline phosphatase levels serve as early indicators of healthy aging that are independent of risk for major chronic diseases. We characterize the heritability and genetic associations of our longevity score and demonstrate at least 1 year of extended lifespan for parents of high-scoring patients compared to matched controls. Longitudinal modeling of healthy individuals is thereby established as a tool for understanding healthy aging and longevity."

The study also aimed to investigate the effectiveness of deep learning in discriminating between the two aforementioned groups. To establish reference ranges, the MostGraph measurements of healthy controls (n = 215) were power-transformed to distribute the data more normally. After inverse transformation, the mean ± standard deviation × 2 of the transformed values were used to establish the reference ranges. The number of measured items outside the reference ranges was evaluated to discriminate patients with asthma (n = 941) from controls. Additionally, MostGraph measurements were evaluated using deep learning. Although reference ranges were established, patients with asthma could not be discriminated from controls. However, with deep learning, we could discriminate between the two groups with 78% accuracy.

Analyzing NHANES data from 2013 to 2018, machine learning models were evaluated; random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) along with stacked ensemble model. We performed hyperparameter tuning to improve the performance of the model, and selected important predictors using the best performance model. LASSO showed the highest predictive performance (AUC-ROC = 0.810) rather than other models. Illicit drug use, poverty, and race were highly ranked as predictive factors for developing hepatitis in diabetes patients. Our study demonstrated that a machine-learning-based model performed optimally in the detection of hepatitis among diabetes patients, achieving high performance.

Alert rates (alert count divided by order count) for periods A and B were 12.6% and 14.1%, and override rates (alert override count divided by alert count) were 60.8% and 67.4%, respectively. Of the 296 drugs that were used more than 100 times during each period, 64.5% of the drugs had an increase in alert rate after the transition. Changes in alert rates were tested using chi-squared test and Fisher’s exact test.

Healthy adults (n = 34) were randomized into three groups: control (CON: 9-h sleep opportunities); sleep restriction (SR: 5-h sleep opportunities); or weekend recovery (WR: simulated workweek of 5-h sleep opportunities followed by ad libitum weekend recovery sleep and then 2 days with 5-h sleep opportunities). Blood for metabolomics was collected on the simulated Monday immediately following the weekend. Nine machine learning models, including a machine learning ensemble, were built to classify samples from SR versus CON. Notably, SR showed decreased glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids versus CON. The machine learning ensemble showed the highest G-mean performance and classified 50% of the WR samples as insufficient sleep.

Here, we introduce the first comprehensive open-source framework, scifAI (single-cell imaging flow cytometry AI), for preprocessing, feature engineering, and explainable, predictive machine learning on imaging flow cytometry (IFC) data. Additionally, we generate the largest publicly available IFC dataset of the human immunological synapse containing over 2.8 million images. Using scifAI, we analyze class frequency and morphological changes under different immune stimulation. T cell cytokine production across multiple donors and therapeutic antibodies is quantitatively predicted in vitro, linking morphological features with function and demonstrating the potential to significantly impact antibody design. scifAI is universally applicable to IFC data. Given its modular architecture, it is straightforward to incorporate into existing workflows and analysis pipelines, e.g., for rapid antibody screening and functional characterization."

        "abstract": "Many areas of medicine would benefit from deeper, more accurate phenotyping, but there are limited approaches for phenotyping using clinical notes without substantial annotated data. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated immense potential to adapt to novel tasks with no additional training by specifying task-specific instructions. Here we report the performance of a publicly available LLM, Flan-T5, in phenotyping patients with postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) using discharge notes from electronic health records (n = 271,081). The language model achieves strong performance in extracting 24 granular concepts associated with PPH. Identifying these granular concepts accurately allows the development of interpretable, complex phenotypes and subtypes. The Flan-T5 model achieves high fidelity in phenotyping PPH (positive predictive value of 0.95), identifying 47% more patients with this complication compared to the current standard of using claims codes. This LLM pipeline can be used reliably for subtyping PPH and outperforms a claims-based approach on the three most common PPH subtypes associated with uterine atony, abnormal placentation, and obstetric trauma. The advantage of this approach to subtyping is its interpretability, as each concept contributing to the subtype determination can be evaluated. Moreover, as definitions may change over time due to new guidelines, using granular concepts to create complex phenotypes enables prompt and efficient updating of the algorithm. Using this language modelling approach enables rapid phenotyping without the need for any manually annotated training data across multiple clinical use cases."

        "abstract": "To prevent immediate mortality in patients with a tracheostomy tube, it is essential to ensure timely suctioning or replacement of the tube. Breathing sounds at the entrance of tracheostomy tubes were recorded with a microphone and analyzed using a spectrogram to detect airway problems. The sounds were classified into three categories based on the waveform of the spectrogram according to the obstacle status: normal breathing sounds (NS), vibrant breathing sounds (VS) caused by movable obstacles, and sharp breathing sounds (SS) caused by fixed obstacles. A total of 3950 breathing sounds from 23 patients were analyzed. Despite neither the patients nor the medical staff recognizing any airway problems, the number and percentage of NS, VS, and SS were 1449 (36.7%), 1313 (33.2%), and 1188 (30.1%), respectively. Artificial intelligence (AI) was utilized to automatically classify breathing sounds. MobileNet and Inception_v3 exhibited the highest sensitivity and specificity scores of 0.9441 and 0.9414, respectively. When classifying into three categories, ResNet_50 showed the highest accuracy of 0.9027, and AlexNet showed the highest accuracy of 0.9660 in abnormal sounds. Classifying breathing sounds into three categories is very useful in deciding whether to suction or change the tracheostomy tubes, and AI can accomplish this with high accuracy."

        "abstract": "Deep learning transformer-based models using longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) have shown a great success in prediction of clinical diseases or outcomes. Pretraining on a large dataset can help such models map the input space better and boost their performance on relevant tasks through finetuning with limited data. In this study, we present TransformEHR, a generative encoder-decoder model with transformer that is pretrained using a new pretraining objective—predicting all diseases and outcomes of a patient at a future visit from previous visits. TransformEHR’s encoder-decoder framework, paired with the novel pretraining objective, helps it achieve the new state-of-the-art performance on multiple clinical prediction tasks. Comparing with the previous model, TransformEHR improves area under the precision–recall curve by 2% (p < 0.001) for pancreatic cancer onset and by 24% (p = 0.007) for intentional self-harm in patients with post-traumatic stress disorder. The high performance in predicting intentional self-harm shows the potential of TransformEHR in building effective clinical intervention systems. TransformEHR is also generalizable and can be easily finetuned for clinical prediction tasks with limited data."

While body composition (BC) imaging biomarkers derived from abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) correlate with IHD risk, they are impractical to measure manually. Here, in a retrospective cohort of 8139 contrast-enhanced abdominopelvic CT examinations undergoing up to 5 years of follow-up, we developed multimodal opportunistic risk assessment models for IHD by automatically extracting BC features from abdominal CT images and integrating these with features from each patient’s electronic medical record (EMR). Our predictive methods match and, in some cases, outperform clinical risk scores currently used in IHD risk assessment. We provide clinical interpretability of our model using a new method of determining tissue-level contributions from CT along with weightings of EMR features contributing to IHD risk. We conclude that such a multimodal approach, which automatically integrates BC biomarkers and EMR data, can enhance IHD risk assessment and aid primary prevention efforts for IHD. To further promote research, we release the Opportunistic L3 Ischemic heart disease (OL3I) dataset, the first public multimodal dataset for opportunistic CT prediction of IHD."

In this report, we conducted two studies. In the first study, we conducted an analysis of abundant social media texts. Specifically, a machine-learning based attribution mapping of ~ 68,250 posts related to GLP-1 or GLP-1/GIP agonists on the Reddit platform. Secondly, we recruited participants (n = 153; current alcohol drinkers; BMI ≥ 30) who self-reported either taking Semaglutide (GLP-1 agonist), Tirzepatide (the GLP-1/GIP combination) for ≥ 30 days or, as a control group; no medication to manage diabetes or weight loss for a within and between subject remote study. In the social media study, we report 8 major themes including effects of medications (30%); diabetes (21%); and Weight loss and obesity (19%). Among the alcohol-related posts (n = 1580), 71% were identified as craving reduction, decreased desire to drink, and other negative effects. In the remote study, we observe a significantly lower self-reported intake of alcohol, drinks per drinking episode, binge drinking odds, Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) scores, and stimulating, and sedative effects in the Semaglutide or Tirzepatide group when compared to prior to starting medication timepoint (within-subjects) and the control group (between-subjects). In summary, we provide initial real-world evidence of reduced alcohol consumption in people with obesity taking Semaglutide or Tirzepatide medications, suggesting potential efficacy for treatment in AUD comorbid with obesity."

For this, ten human dry skulls were scanned with two Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) units, a CT unit, and a highly accurate optical surface scanner that provided the true reference models. Water-filled head shells were used for soft tissue simulation during radiographic imaging. The 3D surface models that were repeatedly segmented from the radiographic volumes through a single-threshold approach were used for reproducibility testing. Additionally, they were compared to the true reference model for trueness measurement. Comparisons were performed through 3D surface approximation techniques, using an iterative closest point algorithm. Differences between surface models were assessed through the calculation of mean absolute distances (MAD) between corresponding surfaces and through visual inspection of facial surface colour-coded distance maps. There was very high reproducibility (approximately 0.07 mm) and trueness (0.12 mm on average, with deviations extending locally to 0.5 mm), and no difference between radiographic scanners or settings. The present findings establish the validity of lower radiation CBCT imaging protocols at a similar level to the conventional CT images, when 3D surface models are required for the assessment of facial morphology."

The study revealed the greatest diversity of RV infections at the countrywide level (114 types), followed by the Kilifi HDSS (78 types), the school (47 types), and households (40 types), cumulatively representing >90% of all known RV types. Notably, RV diversity correlated directly with the size of the population under observation, and several RV type variants occasionally fuelled RV infection waves. Our findings highlight the critical role of social structures in shaping RV dynamics, information that can be leveraged to enhance public health strategies. Future research should incorporate whole-genome analysis to understand fine-scale evolution across various social structures."

Efforts to combat LF have primarily focused on rural areas where interactions between rodents and humans are common. However, recent studies indicate a shift in its occurrence from rural to urban areas. We analysed secondary data of reported LF outbreaks from 2017 to 2021 in Ondo State, Nigeria to identify the distribution pattern, ecological variations, and other determinants of disease spread from the ward level using nearest neighbour statistics and regression analysis. Data utilised include LF incidence, ecological variables involving population, nighttime light intensity, vegetation, temperature, market presence, road length, and building area coverage. ArcGIS Pro 3.0 software was employed for spatial analysis. Results revealed spatio-temporal clustering of LF incidents between 2017 and 2021, with an increasing trend followed by a decline in 2021. All wards in Owo Local Government Area were identified as LF hotspots. The ecological variables exhibited significant correlations with the number of LF cases in the wards, except for maximum temperature. Notably, these variables varied significantly between wards with confirmed LF and those without. Therefore, it is important to prioritise strategies for mitigating LF outbreaks in urban areas of Nigeria and other LF-endemic countries."

We propose and evaluate a machine learning (ML) strategy of adaptive predictive enrichment through computational trial phenomaps to optimize RCT enrollment. In simulated group sequential analyses of two large cardiovascular outcomes RCTs of (1) a therapeutic drug (pioglitazone versus placebo; Insulin Resistance Intervention after Stroke (IRIS) trial), and (2) a disease management strategy (intensive versus standard systolic blood pressure reduction in the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT)), we constructed dynamic phenotypic representations to infer response profiles during interim analyses and examined their association with study outcomes. Across three interim timepoints, our strategy learned dynamic phenotypic signatures predictive of individualized cardiovascular benefit. By conditioning a prospective candidate’s probability of enrollment on their predicted benefit, we estimate that our approach would have enabled a reduction in the final trial size across ten simulations (IRIS: −14.8% ± 3.1%, pone-sample t-test = 0.001; SPRINT: −17.6% ± 3.6%, pone-sample t-test < 0.001), while preserving the original average treatment effect (IRIS: hazard ratio of 0.73 ± 0.01 for pioglitazone vs placebo, vs 0.76 in the original trial; SPRINT: hazard ratio of 0.72 ± 0.01 for intensive vs standard systolic blood pressure, vs 0.75 in the original trial; all simulations with Cox regression-derived p value of  < 0.01 for the effect of the intervention on the respective primary outcome). This adaptive framework has the potential to maximize RCT enrollment efficiency."

To our knowledge, no previous study performed smartphone-based digital anthropometric assessments in young athletes. The aim of this study was to investigate the reproducibly and validity of smartphone-based estimation of anthropometric and body composition parameters in youth soccer players. A convenience sample of 124 male players and 69 female players (median ages of 16.2 and 15.5 years, respectively) was recruited. Measurements of body weight and height, one whole-body Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) scan, and acquisition of optical images (performed in duplicate by the Mobile Fit app to obtain two avatars for each player) were performed. The reproducibility analysis showed percent standard error of measurement values < 10% for all anthropometric and body composition measurements, thus indicating high agreement between the measurements obtained for the two avatars. Mobile Fit app overestimated the body fat percentage with respect to DXA (average overestimation of + 3.7% in males and + 4.6% in females), while it underestimated the total lean mass (− 2.6 kg in males and − 2.5 kg in females) and the appendicular lean mass (− 10.5 kg in males and − 5.5 kg in females). Using data of the soccer players, we reparameterized the equations previously proposed to estimate the body fat percentage and the appendicular lean mass and we obtained new equations that can be used in youth athletes for body composition assessment through conventional anthropometrics-based prediction models."

Accurate classification of these subtypes is crucial for personalized treatment and prognosis. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study on the classification of bladder cancer into into three classes, two of them are the malignant set as non invasive type and invasive type and one set is the normal bladder mucosa to be used as stander measurement for computer deep learning. We utilized a dataset containing histopathological images of bladder tissue samples, split into a training set (70%), a validation set (15%), and a test set (15%). Four different deep-learning architectures were evaluated for their performance in classifying bladder cancer, EfficientNetB2, InceptionResNetV2, InceptionV3, and ResNet50V2. Additionally, we explored the potential of Vision Transformers with two different configurations, ViT_B32 and ViT_B16, for this classification task. Our experimental results revealed significant variations in the models’ accuracies for classifying bladder cancer. The highest accuracy was achieved using the InceptionResNetV2 model, with an impressive accuracy of 98.73%. Vision Transformers also showed promising results, with ViT_B32 achieving an accuracy of 99.49%, and ViT_B16 achieving an accuracy of 99.23%. EfficientNetB2 and ResNet50V2 also exhibited competitive performances, achieving accuracies of 95.43% and 93%, respectively. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that deep learning models, particularly Vision Transformers (ViT_B32 and ViT_B16), can effectively classify bladder cancer into its three classes with high accuracy. These findings have potential implications for aiding clinical decision-making and improving patient outcomes in the field of oncology."

The HRV measures, including time/frequency domains and nonlinear measures, were calculated from 5 min epochs of ECG signals from ICU patients. A light gradient boosting machine (LGBM) algorithm was used to develop the proposed model for predicting in-hospital cardiac arrest within 0.5–24 h. The LGBM model using 33 HRV measures achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.881 (95% CI: 0.875–0.887) and an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.104 (95% CI: 0.093–0.116).

The patient survival at discharge from the emergency department (ED), the 30-day survival rate, and the final Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) were secondary prediction outcomes in this study. The Pan-Asian Resuscitation Outcome Study (PAROS) database, which includes out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients transferred by emergency medical service in Asia between 2009 and 2018, was utilized for this study. From the variables available in the PAROS database, we selected relevant variables to predict OHCA outcomes. Light gradient-boosting machine (LightGBM) was used to build the PReCAP model. Between 2009 and 2018, 157,654 patients in the PAROS database were enrolled in our study. In terms of prediction of ROSC on scene, the PReCAP had an AUROC score between 0.85 and 0.87. The PReCAP had an AUROC score between 0.91 and 0.93 for predicting survived to discharge from ED, and an AUROC score between 0.80 and 0.86 for predicting the 30-day survival. The PReCAP predicted CPC with an AUROC score ranging from 0.84 to 0.91. The feature importance differed with time in the PReCAP model prediction of ROSC on scene. Using the PAROS database, PReCAP predicted ROSC on scene, survival to discharge from ED, 30-day survival, and CPC for each minute with an AUROC score ranging from 0.8 to 0.93.

We conducted a prospective observational study with 60 participants undergoing dental treatment under MAC. We utilized a prototype acoustic monitoring system to assess fluid retention in the upper airway by analysing inspiratory sounds. Water was introduced intraorally in participants to simulate fluid retention; artificial intelligence (AI) analysed respiratory sounds pre and post-injection. We also compared respiratory sounds pre-treatment and during coughing events. Coughing was observed in 14 patients during MAC, and 31 instances of apnoea were detected by capnography. However, 27 of these cases had breath sounds. Notably, with intraoral water injection, the Stridor Quantitative Value (STQV) significantly increased; furthermore, the STQV was substantially higher immediately post-coughing in patients who coughed during MAC. In summary, the innovative acoustic monitoring system using AI provides accurate evaluations of fluid retention in the upper airway, offering potential to mitigate aspiration risks during MAC."

In this study, we develop an artificial intelligence-based tool to segment brain lesions on admission CT-scan and predict TIL within the first week in the ICU. A cohort of 29 head injured patients (87 CT-scans; Dataset1) was used to localize (using a structural atlas), segment (manually or automatically with or without transfer learning) 4 or 7 types of lesions and use these metrics to train classifiers, evaluated with AUC on a nested cross-validation, to predict requirements for TIL sum of 11 points or more during the 8 first days in ICU. The validation of the performances of both segmentation and classification tasks was done with Dice and accuracy scores on a sub-dataset of Dataset1 (internal validation) and an external dataset of 12 TBI patients (12 CT-scans; Dataset2). Automatic 4-class segmentation (without transfer learning) was not able to correctly predict the apparition of a day of extreme TIL (AUC = 60 ± 23%). In contrast, manual quantification of volumes of 7 lesions and their spatial location provided a significantly better prediction power (AUC = 89 ± 17%). Transfer learning significantly improved the automatic 4-class segmentation (DICE scores 0.63 vs 0.34) and trained more efficiently a 7-class convolutional neural network (DICE = 0.64). Both validations showed that segmentations based on transfer learning were able to predict extreme TIL with better or equivalent accuracy (83%) as those made with manual segmentations. Our automatic characterization (volume, type and spatial location) of initial brain lesions observed on CT-scan, publicly available on a dedicated computing platform, could predict requirements for high TIL during the first 8 days after severe TBI. Transfer learning strategies may improve the accuracy of CNN-based segmentation models."

        "abstract": "Hospital emergency departments frequently receive lots of bone fracture cases, with pediatric wrist trauma fracture accounting for the majority of them. Before pediatric surgeons perform surgery, they need to ask patients how the fracture occurred and analyze the fracture situation by interpreting X-ray images. The interpretation of X-ray images often requires a combination of techniques from radiologists and surgeons, which requires time-consuming specialized training. With the rise of deep learning in the field of computer vision, network models applying for fracture detection has become an important research topic. In this paper, we use data augmentation to improve the model performance of YOLOv8 algorithm (the latest version of You Only Look Once) on a pediatric wrist trauma X-ray dataset (GRAZPEDWRI-DX), which is a public dataset. The experimental results show that our model has reached the state-of-the-art (SOTA) mean average precision (mAP 50). Specifically, mAP 50 of our model is 0.638, which is significantly higher than the 0.634 and 0.636 of the improved YOLOv7 and original YOLOv8 models. To enable surgeons to use our model for fracture detection on pediatric wrist trauma X-ray images, we have designed the application “Fracture Detection Using YOLOv8 App” to assist surgeons in diagnosing fractures, reducing the probability of error analysis, and providing more useful information for surgery."

This study develops a generative clinical LLM, GatorTronGPT, using 277 billion words of text including (1) 82 billion words of clinical text from 126 clinical departments and approximately 2 million patients at the University of Florida Health and (2) 195 billion words of diverse general English text. We train GatorTronGPT using a GPT-3 architecture with up to 20 billion parameters and evaluate its utility for biomedical natural language processing (NLP) and healthcare text generation. GatorTronGPT improves biomedical natural language processing. We apply GatorTronGPT to generate 20 billion words of synthetic text. Synthetic NLP models trained using synthetic text generated by GatorTronGPT outperform models trained using real-world clinical text. Physicians’ Turing test using 1 (worst) to 9 (best) scale shows that there are no significant differences in linguistic readability (p = 0.22; 6.57 of GatorTronGPT compared with 6.93 of human) and clinical relevance (p = 0.91; 7.0 of GatorTronGPT compared with 6.97 of human) and that physicians cannot differentiate them (p < 0.001). This study provides insights into the opportunities and challenges of LLMs for medical research and healthcare."

        "abstract": "Preoperative knowledge of expected postoperative pain can help guide perioperative pain management and focus interventions on patients with the greatest risk of acute pain. However, current methods for predicting postoperative pain require patient and clinician input or laborious manual chart review and often do not achieve sufficient performance. We use routinely collected electronic health record data from a multicenter dataset of 234,274 adult non-cardiac surgical patients to develop a machine learning method which predicts maximum pain scores on the day of surgery and four subsequent days and validate this method in a prospective cohort. Our method, POPS, is fully automated and relies only on data available prior to surgery, allowing application in all patients scheduled for or considering surgery. Here we report that POPS achieves state-of-the-art performance and outperforms clinician predictions on all postoperative days when predicting maximum pain on the 0–10 NRS in prospective validation, though with degraded calibration. POPS is interpretable, identifying comorbidities that significantly contribute to postoperative pain based on patient-specific context, which can assist clinicians in mitigating cases of acute pain."

The microbiome is a reservoir of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), but the implications of undernutrition on the resistome is unclear. Here we used a postnatal mouse model that is deficient in multiple micronutrients (that is, zinc, folate, iron, vitamin A and vitamin B12 deficient) and shotgun metagenomic sequencing of faecal samples to characterize gut microbiome structure and functional potential, and the resistome. Enterobacteriaceae were enriched in micronutrient-deficient mice compared with mice fed an isocaloric experimental control diet. The mycobiome and virome were also altered with multiple micronutrient deficiencies including increased fungal pathogens such as Candida dubliniensis and bacteriophages. Despite being antibiotic naïve, micronutrient deficiency was associated with increased enrichment of genes and gene networks encoded by pathogenic bacteria that are directly or indirectly associated with intrinsic antibiotic resistance. Bacterial oxidative stress was associated with intrinsic antibiotic resistance in these mice. This analysis reveals multi-kingdom alterations in the gut microbiome as a result of co-occurring multiple micronutrient deficiencies and the implications for antibiotic resistance."

Using Danish national registries and well-established disease algorithms, we examined the bidirectional association between T1D and atopic diseases in childhood and adolescence using Cox Proportional Hazard regression compared to two different unexposed cohorts from a population of 1.5 million Danish children born from 1997 to 2018. We found no associations between T1D and atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, or asthma (defined after age five). However, in multivariable analysis we found an increased risk of persistent wheezing (defined as asthma medication before age five) after T1D with an adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of 1.70 [1.17–2.45]. We also identified an increased risk of developing T1D after persistent wheezing with aHR of 1.24 [1.13–1.36]. This study highlights similar risks of atopic diseases in children with T1D and of T1D in children with atopic disease after age of five years versus healthy controls. However, more research is needed to understand the possible early immunological effects of the link between persistent wheezing and T1D."

Bone mineral density measurement by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the gold standard, but indices on plain hip radiographs also seemed to be reliable screening tools in female or Asian ethnicities in previous studies. Given the lack of knowledge about male patients and Caucasian ethnicities, this study was conducted to evaluate plane hip radiographic indices as a screening tool for osteopenia and osteoporosis in Caucasian female and also male patients before undergoing THA. A retrospective analysis of 216 elderly patients with pre-existing DXA before hip arthroplasty was performed and four indices were calculated on plain hip radiographs: Canal-Flare-Index (CFI), Canal-Calcar-Ratio (CCR), Canal-Bone-Ratio (CBR) 7 and 10 cm below the lesser trochanter. They were correlated with femoral neck DXA T-scores by Pearson’s correlation and intraclass correlation coefficient, and a ROC analysis was performed. A total of 216 patients (49.5% male) were included. CBR-7 and -10 were highly correlated (p < 0.001) with femoral neck T-score in males (Pearson’s correlation CBR-7 r = − 0.60, CBR-10 r = − 0.55) and females (r = − 0.74, r = − 0.77). CBR-7 and -10 also showed good diagnostic accuracy for osteoporosis in the ROC analysis in males (CBR-7: AUC = 0.75, threshold = 0.51; CBR-10: 0.63; 0.50) and females (CBR-7: AUC = 0.87, threshold = 0.55; CBR-10: 0.90; 0.54). Indices such as the Canal Bone Ratio (CBR) 7 or 10 cm below the lesser trochanter on plain hip radiographs are a good screening tool for osteopenia and osteoporosis on plain hip radiographs and can be used to initiate further diagnostics like the gold standard DXA. They differ between male and female patients."

Our results demonstrate that N221 mutations significantly reduce RNR activity, suggesting its role in the development of MDDS. We proposed an allosteric regulation pathway involving a chain of three phenylalanine residues on the αE helix of RNR small subunit β. This pathway connects the C-terminal loop of β2, transfers the activation signal from the large catalytic subunit α to β active site, and controls access of oxygen for radical generation. N221 is near this pathway and likely plays a role in regulating RNR activity. Mutagenesis studies on residues involved in the phenylalanine chain and the regulation pathway were conducted to confirm our proposed mechanism. We also performed molecular dynamic simulation and protein contact network analysis to support our findings. This study sheds new light on RNR small subunit regulation and provides insight on the pathogenesis of MDDS."

Using a deep learning-based hybrid human-AI pipeline, we bridge individual genes and their relevance in human diseases with specific molecular imaging methods. Cross-referencing the Imageable Genome with RNA-seq data from over 60,000 individuals reveals diagnostic, prognostic and predictive imageable genes for a wide variety of major human diseases. Having both the critical size and focus to be altered in its expression during the development and progression of any human disease, the Imageable Genome will generate new imaging tools that improve the understanding, diagnosis and management of human diseases."

However, we lack reproducible respiratory microbiome signatures that can increase our understanding of these conditions and potential treatments. Here, we analyze 16S rRNA sequencing data from 2,177 respiratory samples collected from 1,029 critically ill patients (21.7% with ARDS and 26.3% with HAP) and 327 healthy controls, sourced from 17 published studies. After data harmonization and pooling of individual patient data, we identified microbiota signatures associated with ARDS, HAP and prolonged mechanical ventilation. Microbiota signatures for HAP and prolonged mechanical ventilation were characterized by depletion of a core group of microbes typical of healthy respiratory samples, and the ARDS microbiota signature was distinguished by enrichment of potentially pathogenic respiratory microbes, including Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus. Using machine learning models, we identified clinically informative, three- and four-factor signatures that predicted ARDS, HAP and prolonged mechanical ventilation with relatively high accuracy (area under the curve of 0.751, 0.72 and 0.727, respectively). We validated the signatures in an independent prospective cohort of 136 patients on mechanical ventillation and found that patients with microbiome signatures associated with ARDS, HAP or prolonged mechanical ventilation had longer times to successful extubation than patients lacking these signatures (hazard ratios of 1.56 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07–2.27), 1.51 (95% CI 1.02–2.23) and 1.50 (95% CI 1.03–2.18), respectively).

Interestingly, 70% (19/27) of early-recurrent low-intermediate grade tumors were identified by our image model. Relative to existing markers, image-based analyses provide complementary information for predicting early recurrence."

Machine learning (ML) approaches may offer advantages over traditional regression techniques to predict it. We compared the ability of traditional regression techniques and different ML-based modeling approaches to identify clinically meaningful fluid overload predictors. This was a retrospective, observational cohort study of adult patients admitted to an ICU ≥ 72 h between 10/1/2015 and 10/31/2020 with available fluid balance data. Models to predict fluid overload (a positive fluid balance ≥ 10% of the admission body weight) in the 48–72 h after ICU admission were created. Potential patient and medication fluid overload predictor variables (n = 28) were collected at either baseline or 24 h after ICU admission. The optimal traditional logistic regression model was created using backward selection. Supervised, classification-based ML models were trained and optimized, including a meta-modeling approach. Area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC), positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were compared between the traditional and ML fluid prediction models. A total of 49 of the 391 (12.5%) patients developed fluid overload. Among the ML models, the XGBoost model had the highest performance (AUROC 0.78, PPV 0.27, NPV 0.94) for fluid overload prediction. The XGBoost model performed similarly to the final traditional logistic regression model (AUROC 0.70; PPV 0.20, NPV 0.94). Feature importance analysis revealed severity of illness scores and medication-related data were the most important predictors of fluid overload. In the context of our study, ML and traditional models appear to perform similarly to predict fluid overload in the ICU. Baseline severity of illness and ICU medication regimen complexity are important predictors of fluid overload."

Our study included 182 consecutive cases (average age 62.2 ± 4.5 years, 169 men) and employed 14 non-deep learning models for prediction (hold-out method). These models utilized selected electrocardiogram parameters and clinical features collected after ICD implantation. From the feature importance analysis of the best ML model, we established easily calculable scores. Among the patients, 25 (13.7%) experienced inappropriate therapy, and we identified 16 significant predictors. Using recursive feature elimination with cross-validation, we reduced the features to six with high feature importance: history of atrial arrhythmia (Atr-arrhythm), ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM), absence of diabetes mellitus (DM), lack of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), V3 ST level at J point (V3 STJ), and V5 R-wave amplitudes (V5R amp). The extra-trees classifier yielded the highest area under receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC; 0.869 on test data). Thus, the Cardi35 score was defined as [+ 5.5*Atr-arrhythm − 1.5*CRT + 1.0*V3STJ + 1.0*V5R − 1.0*ICM − 0.5*DM], which demonstrated a hazard ratio of 1.62 (P < 0.001). A cut-off value of the score + 5.5 showed high AUROC (0.826). The ML approach can yield a robust prediction model, and the Cardi35 score was a convenient predictor for inappropriate therapy."

This retrospective study included consecutive 517 ischemic stroke (IS) patients who received NCCT within 12 h after stroke onset. A total of 21,436 infarction patches and 20,391 non-infarction patches were extracted from the slice pool of 1,634 NCCT according to brain symmetricity property.

        "abstract": "Medical datasets inherently contain errors from subjective or inaccurate test results, or from confounding biological complexities. It is difficult for medical experts to detect these elusive errors manually, due to lack of contextual information, limiting data privacy regulations, and the sheer scale of data to be reviewed. Current methods for training robust artificial intelligence (AI) models on data containing mislabeled examples generally fall into one of several categories—attempting to improve the robustness of the model architecture, the regularization techniques used, the loss function used during training, or selecting a subset of data that contains cleaner labels. This last category requires the ability to efficiently detect errors either prior to or during training, either relabeling them or removing them completely. More recent progress in error detection has focused on using multi-network learning to minimize deleterious effects of errors on training, however, using many neural networks to reach a consensus on which data should be removed can be computationally intensive and inefficient. In this work, a deep-learning based algorithm was used in conjunction with a label-clustering approach to automate error detection. For dataset with synthetic label flips added, these errors were identified with an accuracy of up to 85%, while requiring up to 93% less computing resources to complete compared to a previous model consensus approach developed previously. The resulting trained AI models exhibited greater training stability and up to a 45% improvement in accuracy, from 69 to over 99% compared to the consensus approach, at least 10% improvement on using noise-robust loss functions in a binary classification problem, and a 51% improvement for multi-class classification. These results indicate that practical, automated a priori detection of errors in medical data is possible, without human oversight."

        "abstract": "This study was to develop a computer vision evaluation method to automatically measure the degree of scoliosis based on the machine learning algorithm. For the X-ray images of 204 patients with idiopathic scoliosis who underwent full-spine radiography, histogram equalization of original image was performed before a flipping method was used to magnify asymmetric elements, search for the global maximum pixel value in each line, and scan local maximal pixel value, with the intersection set of two point sets being regarded as candidate anchor points. All fine anchors were fitted with cubic spline algorithm to obtain the approximate curve of the spine, and the degree of scoliosis was measured by the standardized integral area. All measured data were analyzed. In manual measurement, the Cobb angle was 11.70–25.00 (20.15 ± 3.60), 25.20–44.70 (33.89 ± 5.41), and 45.10–49.40 (46.98 ± 1.25) in the mild, moderate and severe scoliosis group, respectively, whereas the value for the standardized integral area algorithm was 0.072–0.298 (0.185 ± 0.040), 0.100–0.399 (0.245 ± 0.050), and 0.246–0.901 (0.349 ± 0.181) in the mild, moderate and severe scoliosis group, respectively. Correlation analysis between the manual measurement of the Cobb angle and the evaluation of the standardized integral area algorithm demonstrated the Spearman correlation coefficient r = 0.643 (P < 0.001). There was a positive correlation between the manual measurement of the Cobb angle and the measurement of the standardized integral area value. Two methods had good consistency in evaluating the degree of scoliosis. ROC curve analysis of the standardized integral area algorithm to measure the degree of scoliosis showed he cutoff value of the standardized integral area algorithm was 0.20 for the moderate scoliosis with an AUC of 0.865, sensitivity 0.907, specificity 0.635, accuracy 0.779, positive prediction value 0.737 and negative prediction value 0.859, and the cutoff value of the standardized integral area algorithm was 0.40 for the severe scoliosis with an AUC of 0.873, sensitivity 0.188, specificity 1.00, accuracy 0.936, positive prediction value 1 and a negative prediction value 0.935. Using the standardized integral area as an independent variable and the Cobb angle as a dependent variable, a linear regression equation was established as Cobb angle = 13.36 + 70.54 × Standardized area, the model has statistical significance. In conclusion, the integrated area algorithm method of machine learning can quickly and efficiently assess the degree of scoliosis and is suitable for screening the degree of scoliosis in a large dataset as a useful supplement to the fine measurement of scoliosis Cobb angle."

        "abstract": "Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), which combat bacterial infections by disrupting the bacterial cell membrane or interacting with intracellular targets, are naturally produced by a number of different organisms, and are increasingly also explored as therapeutics. However, the mechanisms by which AMPs act on intracellular targets are not well understood. Using machine learning-based sequence analysis, we identified a significant number of AMPs that have a strong tendency to form liquid-like condensates in the presence of nucleic acids through phase separation. We demonstrate that this phase separation propensity is linked to the effectiveness of the AMPs in inhibiting transcription and translation in vitro, as well as their ability to compact nucleic acids and form clusters with bacterial nucleic acids in bacterial cells. These results suggest that the AMP-driven compaction of nucleic acids and modulation of their phase transitions constitute a previously unrecognised mechanism by which AMPs exert their antibacterial effects. The development of antimicrobials that target nucleic acid phase transitions may become an attractive route to finding effective and long-lasting antibiotics."

Language identification refers to the process of detecting which speech a speaker appears to be using. This paper presents an audio-based Ethio-semitic language identification system using Recurrent Neural Network. Identifying the features that can accurately differentiate between various languages is a difficult task because of the very high similarity between characters of each language. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) was used in this paper in relation to the Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) features to bring out the key features which helps provide good results. The primary goal of this research is to find the best model for the identification of Ethio-semitic languages such as Amharic, Geez, Guragigna, and Tigrigna. The models were tested using an 8-h collection of audio recording. Experiments were carried out using our unique dataset with an extended version of RNN, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (BLSTM), for 5 and 10 s, respectively. According to the results, Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (BLSTM) with a 5 s delay outperformed Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). The BLSTM model achieved average results of 98.1, 92.9, and 89.9% for training, validation, and testing accuracy, respectively. As a result, we can infer that the best performing method for the selected Ethio-Semitic language dataset was the BLSTM algorithm with MFCCs feature running for 5 s."

However, chronologically defined age often disagrees with biological age, primarily due to genetic and environmental variables. Identifying effective indicators for biological age in clinical practice and self-monitoring is important but currently lacking. The human lens accumulates age-related changes that are amenable to rapid and objective assessment. Here, using lens photographs from 20 to 96-year-olds, we develop LensAge to reflect lens aging via deep learning. LensAge is closely correlated with chronological age of relatively healthy individuals (R2 > 0.80, mean absolute errors of 4.25 to 4.82 years). Among the general population, we calculate the LensAge index by contrasting LensAge and chronological age to reflect the aging rate relative to peers. The LensAge index effectively reveals the risks of age-related eye and systemic disease occurrence, as well as all-cause mortality. It outperforms chronological age in reflecting age-related disease risks (p < 0.001). More importantly, our models can conveniently work based on smartphone photographs, suggesting suitability for routine self-examination of aging status. Overall, our study demonstrates that the LensAge index may serve as an ideal quantitative indicator for clinically assessing and self-monitoring biological age in humans."

        "abstract": "In an observational study conducted from 2016 to 2021, we assessed the utility of radiomics in differentiating between benign and malignant lung nodules detected on computed tomography (CT) scans. Patients in whom a final diagnosis regarding the lung nodules was available according to histopathology and/or 2017 Fleischner Society guidelines were included. The radiomics workflow included lesion segmentation, region of interest (ROI) definition, pre-processing, and feature extraction. Employing random forest feature selection, we identified ten important radiomic features for distinguishing between benign and malignant nodules. Among the classifiers tested, the Decision Tree model demonstrated superior performance, achieving 79% accuracy, 75% sensitivity, 85% specificity, 82% precision, and 90% F1 score. The implementation of the XGBoost algorithm further enhanced these results, yielding 89% accuracy, 89% sensitivity, 89% precision, and an F1 score of 89%, alongside a specificity of 85%. Our findings highlight tumor texture as the primary predictor of malignancy, emphasizing the importance of texture-based features in computational oncology. Thus, our study establishes radiomics as a powerful, non-invasive adjunct to CT scans in the differentiation of lung nodules, with significant implications for clinical decision-making, especially for indeterminate nodules, and the enhancement of diagnostic and predictive accuracy in this clinical context."

        "abstract": "Despite the dedicated research of artificial intelligence (AI) for pathological images, the construction of AI applicable to histopathological tissue subtypes, is limited by insufficient dataset collection owing to disease infrequency. Here, we present a solution involving the addition of supplemental tissue array (TA) images that are adjusted to the tonality of the main data using a cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) to the training data for rare tissue types. F1 scores of rare tissue types that constitute < 1.2% of the training data were significantly increased by improving recall values after adding color-adjusted TA images constituting < 0.65% of total training patches. The detector also enabled the equivalent discrimination of clinical images from two distinct hospitals and the capability was more increased following color-correction of test data before AI identification (F1 score from 45.2 ± 27.1 to 77.1 ± 10.3, p < 0.01). These methods also classified intraoperative frozen sections, while excessive supplementation paradoxically decreased F1 scores. These results identify strategies for building an AI that preserves the imbalance between training data with large differences in actual disease frequencies, which is important for constructing AI for practical histopathological classification."

        "abstract": "Extended duration of normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) provides opportunities to resuscitate suboptimal donor livers. This intervention requires adequate oxygen delivery typically provided by a blood-based perfusion solution. Methaemoglobin (MetHb) results from the oxidation of iron within haemoglobin and represents a serious problem in perfusions lasting > 24 h. We explored the effects of anti-oxidant, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on the accumulation of methaemoglobin. NMP was performed on nine human donor livers declined for transplantation: three were perfused without NAC (no-NAC group), and six organs perfused with an initial NAC bolus, followed by continuous infusion (NAC group), with hourly methaemoglobin perfusate measurements. In-vitro experiments examined the impact of NAC (3 mg) on red cells (30 ml) in the absence of liver tissue. The no-NAC group sustained perfusions for an average of 96 (range 87–102) h, universally developing methaemoglobinaemia (≥ 2%) observed after an average of 45 h, with subsequent steep rise. The NAC group was perfused for an average of 148 (range 90–184) h. Only 2 livers developed methaemoglobinaemia (peak MetHb of 6%), with an average onset of 116.5 h. Addition of NAC efficiently limits formation and accumulation of methaemoglobin during NMP, and allows the significant extension of perfusion duration."

We trained three commonly used networks (EfficientNetV2-S, ResNet-18, and ResNet-34) on a cohort of 1009 and 1111 CT localizers of pediatric patients with recorded body height and weight (between January 2013 and December 2019) and validated them in an additional cohort of 116 and 127 localizers (acquired in 2020). The best-performing model was then tested in an independent cohort of 203 and 225 CT localizers (acquired between January 2021 and March 2023). In addition, a cohort of 1401 and 1590 localizers from younger adults (acquired between January 2013 and December 2013) was added to the training set to determine if it could improve the overall accuracy. The EfficientNetV2-S using the additional adult cohort performed best with a mean absolute error of 5.58 ± 4.26 cm for height and 4.25 ± 4.28 kg for weight. The relative error was 4.12 ± 4.05% for height and 11.28 ± 12.05% for weight. Our study demonstrated that automated estimation of height and weight in pediatric patients from CT localizers can be performed."

In this study, we present four interpretable machine learning-based decision support algorithms for predicting antimicrobial resistance. Using electronic health record data from a large cohort of patients diagnosed with potentially complicated UTIs, we demonstrate high predictability of antibiotic resistance across four antibiotics – nitrofurantoin, co-trimoxazole, ciprofloxacin, and levofloxacin. We additionally demonstrate the generalizability of our methods on a separate cohort of patients with uncomplicated UTIs, demonstrating that machine learning-driven approaches can help alleviate the potential of administering non-susceptible treatments, facilitate rapid effective clinical interventions, and enable personalized treatment suggestions. Additionally, these techniques present the benefit of providing model interpretability, explaining the basis for generated predictions."

        "abstract": "The electroencephalogram (EEG) based motor imagery (MI) signal classification, also known as motion recognition, is a highly popular area of research due to its applications in robotics, gaming, and medical fields. However, the problem is ill-posed as these signals are non-stationary and noisy. Recently, a lot of efforts have been made to improve MI signal classification using a combination of signal decomposition and machine learning techniques but they fail to perform adequately on large multi-class datasets. Previously, researchers have implemented long short-term memory (LSTM), which is capable of learning the time-series information, on the MI-EEG dataset for motion recognition. However, it can not model very long-term dependencies present in the motion recognition data. With the advent of transformer networks in natural language processing (NLP), the long-term dependency issue has been widely addressed. Motivated by the success of transformer algorithms, in this article, we propose a transformer-based deep learning neural network architecture that performs motion recognition on the raw BCI competition III IVa and IV 2a datasets. The validation results show that the proposed method achieves superior performance than the existing state-of-the-art methods. The proposed method produces classification accuracy of 99.7% and 84% on the binary class and the multi-class datasets, respectively. Further, the performance of the proposed transformer-based model is also compared with LSTM."

The incorporation of smartphones and wearable devices in clinical trials provide a unique opportunity to monitor behavior in a non-invasive manner. The objective of this study is to identify the correlations between remotely monitored self-reported assessments and objectively measured activities with depression severity assessments often applied in clinical trials. 30 unipolar depressed patients and 29 age- and gender-matched healthy controls were enrolled in this study. Each participant’s daily physiological, physical, and social activity were monitored using a smartphone-based application (CHDR MORE™) for 3 weeks continuously. Self-reported depression anxiety stress scale-21 (DASS-21) and positive and negative affect schedule (PANAS) were administered via smartphone weekly and daily respectively. The structured interview guide for the Hamilton depression scale and inventory of depressive symptomatology–clinical rated (SIGHD-IDSC) was administered in-clinic weekly. Nested cross-validated linear mixed-effects models were used to identify the correlation between the CHDR MORE™ features with the weekly in-clinic SIGHD-IDSC scores. The SIGHD-IDSC regression model demonstrated an explained variance (R2) of 0.80, and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of ± 15 points. The SIGHD-IDSC total scores were positively correlated with the DASS and mean steps-per-minute, and negatively correlated with the travel duration. Unobtrusive, remotely monitored behavior and self-reported outcomes are correlated with depression severity. While these features cannot replace the SIGHD-IDSC for estimating depression severity, it can serve as a complementary approach for assessing depression and drug effects outside the clinic."

We aimed to develop a model to predict COPD exacerbation. We merged the Korean COPD subgroup study (KOCOSS) dataset with nationwide medical claims data, information regarding weather, air pollution, and epidemic respiratory virus data. The Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) dataset was used for validation. Several machine learning methods were employed to increase the predictive power. The development dataset consisted of 590 COPD patients enrolled in the KOCOSS cohort; these were randomly divided into training and internal validation subsets on the basis of the individual claims data. We selected demographic and spirometry data, medications for COPD and hospital visit for AE, air pollution data and meteorological data, and influenza virus data as contributing factors for the final model. Six machine learning and logistic regression tools were used to evaluate the performance of the model. A light gradient boosted machine (LGBM) afforded the best predictive power with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.935 and an F1 score of 0.653. Similar favorable predictive performance was observed for the 2151 individuals in the external validation dataset. Daily prediction of the COPD exacerbation risk may help patients to rapidly assess their risk of exacerbation and will guide them to take appropriate intervention in advance. This might lead to reduction of the personal and socioeconomic burdens associated with exacerbation."

Bladder cancer is one of the most prevalent types of cancer affecting all individuals alike with no obvious “prototypical patient”. The current standard treatment for BC follows a routine weekly Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) immunotherapy-based therapy protocol which is applied to all patients alike. The clinical outcomes associated with BCG treatment vary significantly among patients due to the biological and clinical complexity of the interaction between the immune system, treatments, and cancer cells. In this study, we take advantage of the patient’s socio-demographics to offer a personalized mathematical model that describes the clinical dynamics associated with BCG-based treatment. To this end, we adopt a well-established BCG treatment model and integrate a machine learning component to temporally adjust and reconfigure key parameters within the model thus promoting its personalization. Using real clinical data, we show that our personalized model favorably compares with the original one in predicting the number of cancer cells at the end of the treatment, with \\(14.8\\%\\) improvement, on average."

        "abstract": "The distinction between Parkinson’s disease (PD) and essential tremor (ET) tremors is subtle, posing challenges in differentiation. To accurately classify the PD and ET, BiLSTM-based recurrent neural networks are employed to classify between normal patients (N), PD patients, and ET patients using accelerometry data on their lower arm (L), hand (H), and upper arm (U) as inputs. The trained recurrent neural network (RNN) has reached 80% accuracy. The neural network is analyzed using layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) to understand the internal workings of the neural network. A novel explainable AI method, called LRP-based approximate linear weights (ALW), is introduced to identify the similarities in relevance when assigning the class scores in the neural network. The ALW functions as a 2D kernel that linearly transforms the input data directly into the class scores, which significantly reduces the complexity of analyzing the neural network. This new classification method reconstructs the neural network’s original function, achieving a 73% PD and ET tremor classification accuracy. By analyzing the ALWs, the correlation between each input and the class can also be determined. Then, the differentiating features can be subsequently identified. Since the input is preprocessed using short-time Fourier transform (STFT), the differences between the magnitude of tremor frequencies ranging from 3 to 30 Hz in the mean N, PD, and ET subjects are successfully identified. Aside from matching the current medical knowledge on frequency content in the tremors, the differentiating features also provide insights about frequency contents in the tremors in other frequency bands and body parts."

With longitudinally followed discovery and replication cohorts, we identify CSF proteins that consistently predicted both short- and long-term disease progression. Lower levels of neurofilament light chain (NfL) in CSF is superior in predicting the absence of disease activity two years after sampling (replication AUC = 0.77) compared to all other tested proteins. Importantly, we also identify a combination of 11 CSF proteins (CXCL13, LTA, FCN2, ICAM3, LY9, SLAMF7, TYMP, CHI3L1, FYB1, TNFRSF1B and NfL) that predict the severity of disability worsening according to the normalized age-related MS severity score (replication AUC = 0.90). The identification of these proteins may help elucidate pathogenetic processes and might aid decisions on treatment strategies for persons with MS."

In this longitudinal study, we enrolled 332 patients form Imam hospital in Ardabil, Iran, with mean age: 77.4 (SD 10.4) years, and 50.6% were male. Diagnosis of BS was confirmed using both computerized tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging, and risk factor and outcome data were collected from the hospital’s BS registry, and by telephone follow-up over a period of 10 years, respectively. Using a multilayer perceptron NN approach, we analysed the impact of various risk factors on time to mortality and mortality from BS. A total of 100 NN classification algorithm were trained utilizing STATISTICA 13 software, and the optimal model was selected for further analysis based on their diagnostic performance. We also calculated Kaplan–Meier survival probabilities and conducted Log-rank tests. The five selected NN models exhibited impressive accuracy ranges of 81–85%. However, the optimal model stood out for its superior diagnostic indices. Mortality rate in the training and the validation data set was 7.9 (95% CI 5.7–11.0) per 1000 and 8.2 (7.1–9.6) per 1000, respectively (P = 0.925). The optimal model highlighted significant risk factors for BS mortality, including smoking, lower education, advanced age, lack of physical activity, a history of diabetes, all carrying substantial importance weights. Our study provides compelling evidence that the NN approach is highly effective in predicting mortality in patients with BS based on key risk factors, and has the potential to significantly enhance the accuracy of prediction. Moreover, our findings could inform more effective prevention strategies for BS, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes."

The purpose of this study is to evaluate deep learning algorithms and their supporting application software for their ability to recognize and categorize three dimensional (3D) Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) images of dental implants. By using CBCT technology, the 3D imaging data of 27 implants of various sizes and brands were obtained. Following manual processing, the data were transformed into a data set that had 13,500 two-dimensional data. Nine deep learning algorithms including GoogleNet, InceptionResNetV2, InceptionV3, ResNet50, ResNet50V2, ResNet101, ResNet101V2, ResNet152 and ResNet152V2 were used to perform the data. Accuracy rates, confusion matrix, ROC curve, AUC, number of model parameters and training times were used to assess the efficacy of these algorithms. These 9 deep learning algorithms achieved training accuracy rates of 100%, 99.3%, 89.3%, 99.2%, 99.1%, 99.5%, 99.4%, 99.5%, 98.9%, test accuracy rates of 98.3%, 97.5%, 94.8%, 85.4%, 92.5%, 80.7%, 93.6%, 93.2%, 99.3%, area under the curve (AUC) values of 1.00, 1.00, 1.00, 1.00, 1.00, 1.00, 1.00, 1.00, 1.00.

The results showed that the ResNet152V2 has the best classification effect on identifying implants. The artificial intelligence identification system and application software based on this algorithm can efficiently and accurately identify the brands and specifications of 27 classified implants through processed 3D CBCT images in vitro, with high stability and low recognition cost."

Using color fundus photographs, the system detects glaucoma in two steps. In the first step, the optic disc region is determined relying upon You Only Look Once (YOLO) CNN architecture. In the second step classification of ‘glaucomatous’ and ‘non-glaucomatous’ is performed using MobileNet architecture. A simplified version of the original YOLO net, specific to the context, is also proposed. Extensive experiments are conducted using seven state-of-the-art CNNs with varying computational intensity, namely, MobileNetV2, MobileNetV3, Custom ResNet, InceptionV3, ResNet50, 18-Layer CNN and InceptionResNetV2. A total of 6671 fundus images collected from seven publicly available glaucoma datasets are used for the experiment. The system achieves an accuracy and F1 score of 97.4% and 97.3%, with sensitivity, specificity, and AUC of respectively 97.5%, 97.2%, 99.3%. These findings are comparable with the best reported methods in the literature. With comparable or better performance, the proposed system produces significantly faster decisions and drastically minimizes the resource requirement. For example, the proposed system requires 12 times less memory in comparison to ResNes50, and produces 2 times faster decisions. With significantly less memory efficient and faster processing, the proposed system has the capability to be directly embedded into resource limited devices such as portable fundus cameras."

SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) enhance the interpretability of the models. Top-performing predictive models are the ones built with LightGBM and Random Forest algorithms. For grade II gliomas, the models yield AUROC values ranging from 0.813 to 0.896 for predicting mortality across different timeframes, and for grade III gliomas, the models yield AUROCs ranging from 0.855 to 0.878. ML models provide individualized survival forecasts for grade II and III glioma patients across multiple clinically relevant time points.

This study aims to explore existing standards, frameworks and best practices for ensuring adequate data diversity in health datasets. Exploring the body of existing literature and expert views is an important step towards the development of consensus-based guidelines. The study comprises two parts: a systematic review of existing standards, frameworks and best practices for healthcare datasets; and a survey and thematic analysis of stakeholder views of bias, health equity and best practices for artificial intelligence as a medical device. We found that the need for dataset diversity was well described in literature, and experts generally favored the development of a robust set of guidelines, but there were mixed views about how these could be implemented practically. The outputs of this study will be used to inform the development of standards for transparency of data diversity in health datasets (the STANDING Together initiative)."

Break-up-time, Schirmer test I, corneal fluorescein staining, Meibomian gland expressibility; conjunctival hyperemia, upper bulbar conjunctiva area of exposure, limbus to superior eyelid distance; and conjunctival epithelial and stromal (CET, CST) thickness and reflectivity (ECR, SCR) at AS-OCT were considered. Successful FS required a 30% baseline intraocular pressure reduction, with values ≤ 18 mmHg with or without medications. The classification tree (CT) was the ML algorithm used to analyze data. At the twelfth month, FS was successful in 60.8% of cases, whereas failed in 39.2%. At the variable importance ranking, CST and SCR were the predictors with the greater relative importance to the CART tree construction, followed by age. CET and ECR showed less relative importance, whereas OSCTs and SSPs were not important features. Within the CT, CST turned out the most important variable for discriminating success from failure, followed by SCR and age, with cut-off values of 75 µm, 169 on gray scale, and 62 years, respectively. The ROC curve for the classifier showed an AUC of 0.784 (0.692–0.860). In this ML approach, CT analysis found that conjunctival stroma thickness and reflectivity, along with age, can predict the FS outcome with good accuracy. A pre-operative thick and hyper-reflective stroma, and a younger age increase the risk of FS failure."

        "abstract": "In the past decade, there has been a sharp increase in publications describing applications of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in medical image analysis. However, recent reviews have warned of the lack of reproducibility of most such studies, which has impeded closer examination of the models and, in turn, their implementation in healthcare. On the other hand, the performance of these models is highly dependent on decisions on architecture and image pre-processing. In this work, we assess the reproducibility of three studies that use CNNs for head and neck cancer outcome prediction by attempting to reproduce the published results. In addition, we propose a new network structure and assess the impact of image pre-processing and model selection criteria on performance. We used two publicly available datasets: one with 298 patients for training and validation and another with 137 patients from a different institute for testing. All three studies failed to report elements required to reproduce their results thoroughly, mainly the image pre-processing steps and the random seed. Our model either outperforms or achieves similar performance to the existing models with considerably fewer parameters. We also observed that the pre-processing efforts significantly impact the model’s performance and that some model selection criteria may lead to suboptimal models. Although there have been improvements in the reproducibility of deep learning models, our work suggests that wider implementation of reporting standards is required to avoid a reproducibility crisis."

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to develop a wearable paradigm to accurately monitor Achilles tendon loading and walking speed using wearable sensors that reduce subject burden. Ten healthy adults walked in an immobilizing boot under various heel wedge conditions (30°, 5°, 0°) and walking speeds. Three-dimensional motion capture, ground reaction force, and 6-axis inertial measurement unit (IMU) signals were collected. We used a Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression to predict peak Achilles tendon load and walking speed. The effects of altering sensor parameters were also explored. Walking speed models (mean absolute percentage error (MAPE): 8.81 ± 4.29%) outperformed tendon load models (MAPE: 34.93 ± 26.3%). Models trained with subject-specific data performed better than models trained without subject-specific data. Removing the gyroscope, decreasing the sampling frequency, and using combinations of sensors did not change the usability of the models, having inconsequential effects on model performance. We developed a simple monitoring paradigm that uses LASSO regression and wearable sensors to accurately predict (MAPE ≤ 12.6%) Achilles tendon loading and walking speed while ambulating in an immobilizing boot. This paradigm provides a clinically implementable strategy to longitudinally monitor patient loading and activity while recovering from Achilles tendon injuries."

        "abstract": "Variants of uncertain significance (VUS) are a significant issue for the molecular diagnosis of rare diseases. The publication of episignatures as effective biomarkers of certain Mendelian neurodevelopmental disorders has raised hopes to help classify VUS. However, prediction abilities of most published episignatures have not been independently investigated yet, which is a prerequisite for an informed and rigorous use in a diagnostic setting. We generated DNA methylation data from 101 carriers of (likely) pathogenic variants in ten different genes, 57 VUS carriers, and 25 healthy controls. Combining published episignature information and new validation data with a k-nearest-neighbour classifier within a leave-one-out scheme, we provide unbiased specificity and sensitivity estimates for each of the signatures. Our procedure reached 100% specificity, but the sensitivities unexpectedly spanned a very large spectrum. While ATRX, DNMT3A, KMT2D, and NSD1 signatures displayed a 100% sensitivity, CREBBP-RSTS and one of the CHD8 signatures reached <40% sensitivity on our dataset. Remaining Cornelia de Lange syndrome, KMT2A, KDM5C and CHD7 signatures reached 70–100% sensitivity at best with unstable performances, suffering from heterogeneous methylation profiles among cases and rare discordant samples. Our results call for cautiousness and demonstrate that episignatures do not perform equally well. Some signatures are ready for confident use in a diagnostic setting. Yet, it is imperative to characterise the actual validity perimeter and interpretation of each episignature with the help of larger validation sample sizes and in a broader set of episignatures."

        "abstract": "Linear biometric measurements on magnetic resonance images are important for the assessment of fetal brain development, which is expert knowledge dependent and laborious. This study aims to construct a segmentation-based method for automatic two-dimensional biometric measurements of fetal brain on magnetic resonance images that provides a fast and accurate measurement of fetal brain. A total of 268 volumes (5360 images) magnetic resonance images of normal fetuses were included. The automatic method involves two steps. First, the fetal brain was segmented into four parts with a deep segmentation network: cerebrum, cerebellum, and left and right lateral ventricles. Second, the measurement plane was determined, and the corresponding biometric parameters were calculated according to clinical guidelines, including cerebral biparietal diameter (CBPD), transverse cerebellar diameter (TCD), left and right atrial diameter (LAD/RAD). Pearson correlation coefficient and Bland–Altman plots were used to assess the correlation and agreement between computer-predicted values and manual measurements. Mean differences were used to evaluate the errors quantitatively. Analysis of fetal cerebral growth based on the automatic measurements was also displayed. The experiment results show that correlation coefficients for CBPD, TCD, LAD and RAD were as follows: 0.977, 0.990, 0.817, 0.719, mean differences were − 2.405 mm, − 0.008 mm, − 0.33 mm, − 0.213 mm, respectively. The correlation between the errors and gestational age was not statistically significant (p values were 0.2595, 0.0510, 0.1995, and 0.0609, respectively). The proposed automatic method for linear measurements on fetal brain MRI achieves excellent performance, which is expected to be applied in clinical practice and be helpful for prenatal diagnosis and clinical work efficiency improvement."

Using the mOBM system, we studied the leukocyte-endothelial interactions in healthy and locally inflamed tissue and observed drastic changes in leukocyte movement (velocity and displacement profile). Our findings suggest that real-time imaging of leukocyte dynamics can provide new diagnostic insights (assessment of inflammation, temporal progression of disease, evaluation of therapeutic response, etc.) that are not available using conventional static parameters such as cell number and morphology."

        "abstract": "Imatinib Mesylate (imatinib) was once hailed as the magic bullet for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and remains a front-line therapy for CML to this day alongside other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). However, TKI treatments are rarely curative and patients are often required to receive life-long treatment or otherwise risk relapse. Thus, there is a growing interest in identifying biomarkers in patients which can predict TKI response upon diagnosis. In this study, we analyze clinical data and differentially expressed miRNAs in CD34+ CML cells from 80 patients at diagnosis who were later classified as imatinib-responders or imatinib-nonresponders. A Cox Proportional Hazard (CoxPH) analysis identified 16 miRNAs that were associated with imatinib nonresponse and differentially expressed in these patients. We also trained a machine learning model with different combinations of the 16 miRNAs with and without clinical parameters and identified a panel with high predictive performance based on area-under-curve values of receiver-operating-characteristic and precision-recall curves. Interestingly, the multivariable panel consisting of both miRNAs and clinical features performed better than either miRNA or clinical panels alone. Thus, our findings may inform future studies on predictive biomarkers and serve as a tool to develop more optimized treatment plans for CML patients in the clinic."

        "abstract": "The electroencephalogram (EEG) has emerged over the past few decades as one of the key tools used by clinicians to detect seizures and other neurological abnormalities of the human brain. The proper diagnosis of epilepsy is crucial due to its distinctive nature and the subsequent negative effects of epileptic seizures on patients. The classification of minimally pre-processed, raw multichannel EEG signal recordings is the foundation of this article’s unique method for identifying seizures in pre-adult patients. The new method makes use of the automatic feature learning capabilities of a three-dimensional deep convolution auto-encoder (3D-DCAE) associated with a neural network-based classifier to build an integrated framework that endures training in a supervised manner to attain the highest level of classification precision among brain state signals, both ictal and interictal. A pair of models were created and evaluated for testing and assessing our method, utilizing three distinct EEG data section lengths, and a tenfold cross-validation procedure. Based on five evaluation criteria, the labelled hybrid convolutional auto-encoder (LHCAE) model, which utilizes a classifier based on bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) and an EEG segment length of 4 s, had the best efficiency. This proposed model has 99.08 ± 0.54% accuracy, 99.21 ± 0.50% sensitivity, 99.11 ± 0.57% specificity, 99.09 ± 0.55% precision, and an F1-score of 99.16 ± 0.58%, according to the publicly available Children’s Hospital Boston (CHB) dataset.

We aimed to develop a model for the automatic measurement of various temporal parameters of swallowing using deep learning. Overall, 547 VFSS video clips were included. Seven temporal parameters were manually measured by two physiatrists as ground-truth data: oral phase duration, pharyngeal delay time, pharyngeal response time, pharyngeal transit time, laryngeal vestibule closure reaction time, laryngeal vestibule closure duration, and upper esophageal sphincter opening duration. ResNet3D was selected as the base model for the deep learning of temporal parameters. The performances of ResNet3D variants were compared with those of the VGG and I3D models used previously. The average accuracy of the proposed ResNet3D variants was from 0.901 to 0.981. The F1 scores and average precision were 0.794 to 0.941 and 0.714 to 0.899, respectively. Compared to the VGG and I3D models, our model achieved the best results in terms of accuracy, F1 score, and average precision values.

        "abstract": "Image quality variation is a prominent cause of performance degradation for intelligent disease diagnostic models in clinical applications. Image quality issues are particularly prominent in infantile fundus photography due to poor patient cooperation, which poses a high risk of misdiagnosis. Here, we developed a deep learning-based image quality assessment and enhancement system (DeepQuality) for infantile fundus images to improve infant retinopathy screening. DeepQuality can accurately detect various quality defects concerning integrity, illumination, and clarity with area under the curve (AUC) values ranging from 0.933 to 0.995. It can also comprehensively score the overall quality of each fundus photograph. By analyzing 2,015,758 infantile fundus photographs from real-world settings using DeepQuality, we found that 58.3% of them had varying degrees of quality defects, and large variations were observed among different regions and categories of hospitals. Additionally, DeepQuality provides quality enhancement based on the results of quality assessment. After quality enhancement, the performance of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) diagnosis of clinicians was significantly improved. Moreover, the integration of DeepQuality and AI diagnostic models can effectively improve the model performance for detecting ROP. This study may be an important reference for the future development of other image-based intelligent disease screening systems."

A microfluidic organ-on-a-chip lined by human lung alveolar epithelium interfaced with pulmonary endothelium (Lung Alveolus Chip) is used to model acute RILI in vitro. Both lung epithelium and endothelium exhibit DNA damage, cellular hypertrophy, upregulation of inflammatory cytokines, and loss of barrier function within 6 h of radiation exposure, although greater damage is observed in the endothelium. The radiation dose sensitivity observed on-chip is more like the human lung than animal preclinical models. The Alveolus Chip is also used to evaluate the potential ability of two drugs - lovastatin and prednisolone - to suppress the effects of acute RILI. These data demonstrate that the Lung Alveolus Chip provides a human relevant alternative for studying the molecular basis of acute RILI and may be useful for evaluation of new radiation countermeasure therapeutics."

        "abstract": "Inflammation is a hallmark of cancer1. In patients with cancer, peripheral blood myeloid expansion, indicated by a high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, associates with shorter survival and treatment resistance across malignancies and therapeutic modalities2,3,4,5. Whether myeloid inflammation drives progression of prostate cancer in humans remain unclear. Here we show that inhibition of myeloid chemotaxis can reduce tumour-elicited myeloid inflammation and reverse therapy resistance in a subset of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). We show that a higher blood neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio reflects tumour myeloid infiltration and tumour expression of senescence-associated mRNA species, including those that encode myeloid-chemoattracting CXCR2 ligands. To determine whether myeloid cells fuel resistance to androgen receptor signalling inhibitors, and whether inhibiting CXCR2 to block myeloid chemotaxis reverses this, we conducted an investigator-initiated, proof-of-concept clinical trial of a CXCR2 inhibitor (AZD5069) plus enzalutamide in patients with metastatic CRPC that is resistant to androgen receptor signalling inhibitors. This combination was well tolerated without dose-limiting toxicity and it decreased circulating neutrophil levels, reduced intratumour CD11b+HLA-DRloCD15+CD14− myeloid cell infiltration and imparted durable clinical benefit with biochemical and radiological responses in a subset of patients with metastatic CRPC. This study provides clinical evidence that senescence-associated myeloid inflammation can fuel metastatic CRPC progression and resistance to androgen receptor blockade. Targeting myeloid chemotaxis merits broader evaluation in other cancers."

Amplitude variation and frequency shift are measured to be around 7 dB and 30 MHz, respectively. The measured results demonstrate the high precision of the proposed approach to depict a valid diagram for glucose changing rate due to good impedance matching of the designed microwave sensor and human body. The sensor is shown to enhance the sensitivity by a factor of 5 compared to the conventional ones."

The study included adult patients in intensive care who underwent multiple pain-related assessments.

Pain was measured as the probability of CPOT scores of ≥ 3, and subsequently adjusted based on each patient's baseline. The study included 10,299 patients with 117,190 CPOT assessments. Of these, 3.3% had CPOT scores of ≥ 3. The random forest model demonstrated strong accuracy with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.903. Patients treated with fentanyl were grouped based on CPOT score improvement. Those with ≥ 1-h of improvement after fentanyl administration had a significantly lower pain index (P = 0.020). Therefore, incorporating deviations from baseline patient vital signs improved the accuracy of pain visualization using machine learning techniques."

Microwave-based approaches offer a fast and cost-effective way to detect quality variations, providing an alternative to traditional techniques in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. This article proposes the use of a microwave sensor for monitoring the quality of pharmaceutical drugs at distinct temperature levels. A small planar sensor based on three hexagonal split ring resonators (TH-SRR) is fabricated. The design is manufactured on an FR-4 dielectric substrate. The sensor is tested on a 1000 mg paracetamol tablet, at temperatures ranging from 40 to 80 \\(^\\circ\\)C. The Variation in the permittivity that characterizes product degradation is translated into a shift in the frequency of the scattering matrix elements. To validate the microwave approach, drug quality is examined with the laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) technique, an optical emission laser used for both qualitative and quantitative investigations of elements contained in a sample. The existing elements are classified using the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) database and categorized according to their spectral line wavelengths. The experiments show the presence of optimal wavelength values for carbon (C), hydrogen (H), nitrogen (N), and oxygen (O) at 247.92 nm, 656.49 nm, 244.23 nm, and 777.48 nm, respectively. The microwave experimental results show a shift frequency of approximately 1 MHz on average when the tablet is heated at 80 \\(^\\circ\\)C for 15 min. Meanwhile, the LIBS measurement shows a remarkable shift in terms of intensity of approximately 8884 and 812 for carbon and hydrogen, respectively.

We incorporated demographics, preoperative comorbidities, and laboratory risk factors. Features were selected using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). Eight machine learning algorithms were benchmarked to identify the best model to predict intraoperative blood transfusion. The prediction tool was established based on the best algorithm and evaluated with discriminative ability. The data were randomly split into training and test groups at a ratio of 7:3. LASSO identified seven preoperative relevant factors in the training group: hemoglobin, diameter, prothrombin time, white blood cell count (WBC), age, physical status of the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification, and heart function. Logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, supporter vector machine, and ranger all performed better in the eight machine learning algorithms with classification errors of 0.185, 0.193, 0.199, and 0.196, respectively.

A total of 132 eyes from 68 patients were examined, including healthy individuals and those with various stages of AMD. Duplicate QAF imaging was conducted at baseline and 2 weeks later across six study sites. Intraclass correlation (ICC) analysis was used to evaluate the consistency of imaging, and mean opinion scores (MOS) of image quality were generated by two researchers. The contribution of MOS and other factors to retest variation was assessed using mixed-effect linear models. Additionally, a Random Forest Regressor was trained to evaluate the extent to which manual image grading of image quality could be replaced by automated assessment (inferred MOS). The results showed that ICC values were high for all QAF images, with slightly lower values in AMD-affected eyes. The average inter-day ICC was found to be 0.77 for QAF segments within the QAF8 ring and 0.74 for peripheral segments. Image quality was predicted with a mean absolute error of 0.27 on a 5-point scale, and of all evaluated reliability indices, MOS/inferred MOS proved most important. The findings suggest that QAF allows for reliable testing of autofluorescence levels at the posterior pole in patients with AMD in a multicenter, multioperator setting. Patient reliability indices could serve as eligibility criteria for clinical trials, helping identify patients with adequate retest reliability."

We proposed a novel psoriasis evaluation method that detects representative regions as evaluation criteria, and extracts severity features to improve the evaluation performance of various types of psoriasis, including multiple-severity diseases. We generated multiple-severity disease images using CutMix and proposed a hierarchical multi-scale deformable attention module (MS-DAM) that can adaptively detect representative regions of irregular and complex patterns in multiple-severity disease analyses. EfficientNet B1 with MS-DAM exhibited the best classification performance with an F1-score of 0.93. Compared with the performance of the six existing self-attention methods, the proposed MS-DAM showed more than 5% higher accuracy than that of multiscale channel attention module (MS-CAM).

        "abstract": "There are several categorical effect size methods in the literature. It is not clear which method performs better for a given dataset and it is a challenging task to select the correct method for a given dataset. In this sense, to overcome the questions like “Which method should we choose?” and “Which categorical effect size method is more reliable for a given dataset?”, an adaptive categorical effect size method based on intuitionistic meta fuzzy functions is introduced in the paper. Thus, the main motivation of the proposed method is to obtain more accurate outcomes by combining the results of better performing methods instead of relying on only one method. In the study, the intuitionistic fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm is adapted to meta fuzzy functions by incorporating not only membership degrees but also non-membership degrees to improve the clustering accuracy of meta fuzzy functions. Meta fuzzy functions are the linear combination of seven categorical effect size methods and the weights, which are calculated from membership grades from intuitionistic fuzzy c-means algorithm. Among the functions, the one with the lowest mean absolute percentage error is selected as the best. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, 2 × 3, 2 × 4, and 3 × 4 contingency tables were simulated. Additionally, the performance of the proposed method is also assessed by applying it to a real-time dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms compared to the evaluated seven categorical effect size methods in terms of mean absolute percentage error. Also, the calculated effect sizes are within the range of ±10% in terms of bias. Thus, the results verified that proposed method achieves greater reliability."

        "abstract": "Myelofibrosis is a hematopoietic stem cell disorder belonging to the myeloproliferative neoplasms. Myelofibrosis patients frequently carry driver mutations in either JAK2 or Calreticulin (CALR) and have limited therapeutic options. Here, we integrate ex vivo drug response and proteotype analyses across myelofibrosis patient cohorts to discover targetable vulnerabilities and associated therapeutic strategies. Drug sensitivities of mutated and progenitor cells were measured in patient blood using high-content imaging and single-cell deep learning-based analyses. Integration with matched molecular profiling revealed three targetable vulnerabilities. First, CALR mutations drive BET and HDAC inhibitor sensitivity, particularly in the absence of high Ras pathway protein levels. Second, an MCM complex-high proliferative signature corresponds to advanced disease and sensitivity to drugs targeting pro-survival signaling and DNA replication. Third, homozygous CALR mutations result in high endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, responding to ER stressors and unfolded protein response inhibition. Overall, our integrated analyses provide a molecularly motivated roadmap for individualized myelofibrosis patient treatment."

Segmentation using a convolutional neural network (CNN) is limited in clearly determining the optimal view. The present study describes the development of a computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) system using a CNN that can determine the optimal view for complete SCB in real time. The aim of this study was the development of computer-aided diagnosis system that aid non-expert to determine the optimal view for complete supraclavicular block in real time. Ultrasound videos were retrospectively collected from 881 patients to develop the CADx system (600 to the training and validation set and 281 to the test set). The CADx system included classification and segmentation approaches, with Residual neural network (ResNet) and U-Net, respectively, applied as backbone networks. In the classification approach, an ablation study was performed to determine the optimal architecture and improve the performance of the model. In the segmentation approach, a cascade structure, in which U-Net is connected to ResNet, was implemented. The performance of the two approaches was evaluated based on a confusion matrix. Using the classification approach, ResNet34 and gated recurrent units with augmentation showed the highest performance, with average accuracy 0.901, precision 0.613, recall 0.757, f1-score 0.677 and AUROC 0.936. Using the segmentation approach, U-Net combined with ResNet34 and augmentation showed poorer performance than the classification approach. The CADx system described in this study showed high performance in determining the optimal view for SCB. This system could be expanded to include many anatomical regions and may have potential to aid clinicians in real-time settings."

Many pregnancy apps allow pregnant women to track their symptoms. To date, the resulting data are primarily used from a commercial rather than a scientific perspective. In this work, we aim to examine symptom occurrence, course, and their correlation throughout pregnancy. Self-reported app data of a pregnancy symptom tracker is used. In this context, we present methods to handle noisy real-world app data from commercial applications to understand the trajectory of user and patient-reported data. We report real-world evidence from patient-reported outcomes that exceeds previous works: 1,549,186 tracked symptoms from 183,732 users of a smartphone pregnancy app symptom tracker are analyzed. The majority of users track symptoms on a single day. These data are generalizable to those users who use the tracker for at least 5 months. Week-by-week symptom report data are presented for each symptom. There are few or conflicting reports in the literature on the course of diarrhea, fatigue, headache, heartburn, and sleep problems. A peak in fatigue in the first trimester, a peak in headache reports around gestation week 15, and a steady increase in the reports of sleeping difficulty throughout pregnancy are found. Our work highlights the potential of secondary use of industry data. It reveals and clarifies several previously unknown or disputed symptom trajectories and relationships. Collaboration between academia and industry can help generate new scientific knowledge."

The dataset comprised five categories: benign nevus, seborrheic keratosis, basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and malignant melanoma. The SkinFLNet's performance was evaluated using 463 clinical images between January and December 2021. SkinFLNet achieved an overall classification accuracy of 85%, precision of 85%, recall of 82%, F-score of 82%, sensitivity of 82%, and specificity of 93%, outperforming other deep convolutional neural network models.

In this study, we analyze associations of 4638 plasma proteins among 3235 participants of the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort Study with the primary outcome of 50% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate or kidney failure over 10 years. We validate key findings in the Atherosclerosis Risk in the Communities study. We identify 100 circulating proteins that are associated with the primary outcome after multivariable adjustment, using a Bonferroni statistical threshold of significance. Individual protein associations and biological pathway analyses highlight the roles of bone morphogenetic proteins, ephrin signaling, and prothrombin activation. A 65-protein risk model for the primary outcome has excellent discrimination (C-statistic[95%CI] 0.862 [0.835, 0.889]), and 14/65 proteins are druggable targets. Potentially causal associations for five proteins, to our knowledge not previously reported, are supported by Mendelian randomization: EGFL9, LRP-11, MXRA7, IL-1 sRII and ILT-2. Modifiable protein risk markers can guide therapeutic drug development aimed at slowing CKD progression."

        "abstract": "Since the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic in 2020, the global community has faced ongoing challenges in controlling and mitigating the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, as well as its evolving subvariants and recombinants. A significant challenge during the pandemic has not only been the accurate detection of positive cases but also the efficient prediction of risks associated with complications and patient survival probabilities. These tasks entail considerable clinical resource allocation and attention. In this study, we introduce COVID-Net Biochem, a versatile and explainable framework for constructing machine learning models. We apply this framework to predict COVID-19 patient survival and the likelihood of developing Acute Kidney Injury during hospitalization, utilizing clinical and biochemical data in a transparent, systematic approach. The proposed approach advances machine learning model design by seamlessly integrating domain expertise with explainability tools, enabling model decisions to be based on key biomarkers. This fosters a more transparent and interpretable decision-making process made by machines specifically for medical applications. More specifically, the framework comprises two phases: In the first phase, referred to as the “clinician-guided design” phase, the dataset is preprocessed using explainable AI and domain expert input. To better demonstrate this phase, we prepared a benchmark dataset of carefully curated clinical and biochemical markers based on clinician assessments for survival and kidney injury prediction in COVID-19 patients. This dataset was selected from a patient cohort of 1366 individuals at Stony Brook University. Moreover, we designed and trained a diverse collection of machine learning models, encompassing gradient-based boosting tree architectures and deep transformer architectures, specifically for survival and kidney injury prediction based on the selected markers. In the second phase, called the “explainability-driven design refinement” phase, the proposed framework employs explainability methods to not only gain a deeper understanding of each model’s decision-making process but also to identify the overall impact of individual clinical and biochemical markers for bias identification. In this context, we used the models constructed in the previous phase for the prediction task and analyzed the explainability outcomes alongside a clinician with over 8 years of experience to gain a deeper understanding of the clinical validity of the decisions made. The explainability-driven insights obtained, in conjunction with the associated clinical feedback, are then utilized to guide and refine the training policies and architectural design iteratively. This process aims to enhance not only the prediction performance but also the clinical validity and trustworthiness of the final machine learning models. Employing the proposed explainability-driven framework, we attained 93.55% accuracy in survival prediction and 88.05% accuracy in predicting kidney injury complications. The models have been made available through an open-source platform. Although not a production-ready solution, this study aims to serve as a catalyst for clinical scientists, machine learning researchers, and citizen scientists to develop innovative and trustworthy clinical decision support solutions, ultimately assisting clinicians worldwide in managing pandemic outcomes."

This study used data from an extensive online survey in Japan to examine the predictors of the subjective well-being of pregnant women. We developed and validated a light Gradient Boosting Machine (lightGBM) model using data from 400 pregnant women in 2020 to identify three factors that predict subjective well-being. The results confirmed that the model could predict subjective well-being in pregnant women with 84% accuracy. New variables that contributed significantly to this prediction were \"partner help\", \"hopelessness,\" and \"health status\". A new lightGBM model was built with these three factors, trained and validated using data from 400 pregnant women in 2020, and predicted using data from 1791 pregnant women in 2021, with an accuracy of 88%. These factors were also significant risk factors for subjective well-being in the regression analysis adjusted for maternal age, region, parity, education level, and the presence of mental illness. Mediation analysis, with “hopelessness” as the mediator, showed that both “partner help” and “health status” directly and indirectly affected the outcome."

Here we report a method for antibody discovery that leverages the Illumina HiSeq platform to, within 3 days, screen in the order of 108 antibody–antigen interactions. The method, which we named ‘deep screening’, involves the clustering and sequencing of antibody libraries, the conversion of the DNA clusters into complementary RNA clusters covalently linked to the instrument’s flow-cell surface on the same location, the in situ translation of the clusters into antibodies tethered via ribosome display, and their screening via fluorescently labelled antigens. By using deep screening, we discovered low-nanomolar nanobodies to a model antigen using 4 × 106 unique variants from yeast-display-enriched libraries, and high-picomolar single-chain antibody fragment leads for human interleukin-7 directly from unselected synthetic repertoires. We also leveraged deep screening of a library of 2.4 × 105 sequences of the third complementarity-determining region of the heavy chain of an anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) antibody as input for a large language model that generated new single-chain antibody fragment sequences with higher affinity for HER2 than those in the original library."

BR.36 is a multi-center, randomized, ctDNA-directed, phase 2 trial of molecular response-adaptive immuno-chemotherapy for patients with lung cancer. In the first of two independent stages, 50 patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer received pembrolizumab as standard of care. The primary objectives of stage 1 were to ascertain ctDNA response and determine optimal timing and concordance with radiologic Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) response. Secondary endpoints included the evaluation of time to ctDNA response and correlation with progression-free and overall survival. Maximal mutant allele fraction clearance at the third cycle of pembrolizumab signified molecular response (mR). The trial met its primary endpoint, with a sensitivity of ctDNA response for RECIST response of 82% (90% confidence interval (CI): 52–97%) and a specificity of 75% (90% CI: 56.5–88.5%). Median time to ctDNA response was 2.1 months (90% CI: 1.5–2.6), and patients with mR attained longer progression-free survival (5.03 months versus 2.6 months) and overall survival (not reached versus 7.23 months). These findings are incorporated into the ctDNA-driven interventional molecular response-adaptive second stage of the BR.36 trial in which patients at risk of progression are randomized to treatment intensification or continuation of therapy.

To aid prognosis, there is a need for decision tools that leverage diagnostic modalities such as MRI to inform survival. In this study, we examine higher-order spatial proximity characteristics from habitats and propose two graph-based methods (minimum spanning tree and graph run-length matrix) to characterize spatial heterogeneity over tumor MRI-derived intensity habitats and assess their relationships with overall survival as well as the immune signature status of patients with glioblastoma. A data set of 74 patients was studied based on the availability of post-contrast T1-weighted and T2-weighted fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) image data in The Cancer Image Archive (TCIA). We assessed the predictive value of MST- and GRLM-derived features from 2D images for prediction of 12-month survival status and immune signature status of patients with glioblastoma via a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. For 12-month survival prediction using MST-based method, sensitivity and specificity were 0.82 and 0.79 respectively. For GRLM-based method, sensitivity and specificity were 0.73 and 0.77 respectively. For immune status, sensitivity and specificity were 0.91 and 0.69, respectively, for the GRLM-based method with an immune effector. Our results show that the proposed MST- and GRLM-derived features are predictive of 12-month survival status as well as the immune signature status of patients with glioblastoma.

We classify 18 genes with robust recessive association with CMs, largely characterized by dilated phenotypes, early disease onset and severe outcomes. Several of these genes have monoallelic association with disease outcomes and cardiac traits in the UK Biobank, including LMOD2 and ALPK3 with dilated and hypertrophic CM, respectively. Our data provide insights into the complex spectrum of dominance and recessiveness in genetic heart disease and demonstrate how such approaches enable the discovery of unexplored genetic associations."

OCTA examinations of 38 subjects were performed. After extracting the images, two semi-manual post-processing techniques, the already established Mexican hat filtering (MHF) and an alternative, the Shanbhag thresholding (ST) were applied. We assessed Vessel Density (VD), Skeleton Density (SkD) and Vessel Diameter Index (VDI). We analyzed the results in order to establish similarities or potentially relevant differences. Regarding SkD and VD, MHF generally gave higher values than ST. Simultaneously, mean values were also predominantly higher by MHF; however, standard deviations (SD) were higher by ST (range [mean ± SD]: 0.054 ± 0.038 to 0.134 ± 0.01 and 0.134 ± 0.095 to 0.362 ± 0.028 vs 0.012 ± 0.014 to 0.087 ± 0.03 and 0.039 ± 0.047 to 0.4 ± 0.095 for SkD and VD with MHF vs SkD and VD with ST, respectively). Values of VDI were considerably higher with ST than with MHF, while standard deviation was still significantly higher with ST (range [mean ± SD]: 2.459 ± 0.144 to 2.71 ± 0.084 and 2.983 ± 0.929 to 5.19 ± 1.064 for VDI with MHF and ST, respectively). The noise level reduction of the two methods were almost identical (noise levels: 65.8% with MHT and 65.24% with ST). Using MHF, the vascular network gets more fragmented by an average of 40% compared to ST. Both methods allow the segmentation of the vascular network and the examination of vascular density parameters, but they produce largely inconsistent results. To determine if these inconsistent results are clinically meaningful, and which method is more suitable for clinical use, our results provide further evidence that detailed understanding of the image analysis method is essential for reliable decision making for patients with retinal pathology. For longitudinal monitoring, use of the same image processing method is recommended."

Seventy-four patients visited the lab seven times at 3-month intervals. Their walking (2-minutes) and postural sway (30-seconds,eyes-closed) were recorded using six Inertial Measurement Unit sensors. Simple linear regression and Random Forest algorithms were utilised together with different routines of automatic feature selection or factorisation, resulting in seven different machine learning algorithms to estimate the clinical rating scale (Movement Disorder Society- Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale part III; MDS-UPDRS-III). Twenty-nine features were found to significantly progress with time at group level. The Random Forest model revealed the most accurate estimation of the MDS-UPDRS-III among the seven models. The model estimations detected a statistically significant progression of the motor symptoms within 15 months when compared to the first visit, whereas the MDS-UPDRS-III did not capture any change. Wearable sensors and machine learning can track the motor symptom progression in people with PD better than the conventionally used clinical rating scales. The methods described in this study can be utilised complimentary to the clinical rating scales to improve the diagnostic and prognostic accuracy."

The second method, clustering analysis, was accomplished by analyzing the implant-specific feature vector derived from three key points coordinates of the dental implant using the k-means++ algorithm and adjusting the weight of the feature vector. DL and clustering model classified dental implant size into nine groups. The performance metrics of AI models were accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1-score, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). The final DL model yielded performances above 0.994, 0.950, 0.994, 0.974, 0.952, 0.994, and 0.975, respectively, and the final clustering model yielded performances above 0.983, 0.900, 0.988, 0.923, 0.909, 0.988, and 0.947, respectively. When comparing the AI model before tuning and the final AI model, statistically significant performance improvements were observed in six out of nine groups for DL models and four out of nine groups for clustering models based on AUC-ROC. Two AI models showed reliable classification performances. For clinical applications, AI models require validation on various multicenter data."

Advancements in high-throughput technology and machine learning have led to improvements to predict a patient’s prognosis for different cancer phenotypes. However, computational methods for analyzing signatures have not been used to evaluate their prognostic power. Contention remains on the utility of gene expression signatures for prognosis. The prevalent approaches include random signatures, expert knowledge, and machine learning to construct an improved signature. We unify these approaches to evaluate their prognostic power. Re-evaluation of publicly available gene-expression data from 8 databases with 9 machine-learning models revealed previously unreported results. Gene-expression signatures are confirmed to be useful in predicting a patient’s prognosis. Convergent evidence from \\(\\approx\\) 10,000 signatures implicates a maximum prognostic power. By calculating the concordance index, which measures how well patients with different prognoses can be discriminated, we show that a signature can correctly discriminate patients’ prognoses no more than 80% of the time. Additionally, we show that more than 50% of the potentially available information is still missing at this value. We surmise that an accurate prognosis must incorporate molecular, clinical, histological, and other complementary factors."

The values of the BCR::ABL1 level at serial assessments and over variables were collected in specified intervals after allo-HSCT. They were used to model relapse risk with several machine-learning approaches. GBM proved superior to the other algorithms and provided a maximal AUC score of 0.91. BCR::ABL1 level before and after allo-HSCT, prediction moment, and chronic GvHD had the highest value in the model. It was shown that after Day + 100, both error rates do not exceed 22%, while before D + 100, the model fails to make accurate predictions. As a result, we determined BCR::ABL1 levels at which the relapse risk remains low. Thus, the current BCR::ABL1 level less than 0.06% in patients with chronic GvHD predicts low risk of relapse. At the same time, patients without chronic GVHD after allo-HSCT should be classified as high risk with any level of BCR::ABL1. GBM model with posttransplant laboratory values of BCR::ABL1 provides a high prediction of relapse after allo-HSCT in the era of TKIs prophylaxis. Validation of this approach is warranted."

In this study, we examined the fulfilment of this essential consistency condition for the ECX-Joyetech E-Vic Mini (ECX), a piece of computerized exposure equipment manufactured by SCIREQ, which has been employed by numerous in vivo testing. We began by calibrating the customary Evic VTC mini device mod and the 4 coils available, reproducing in the laboratory the operation of the ECX in the power-control and temperature-control modes, using puffing parameters recommended by its documentation. We then conducted the following tests for each coil: (1) verifying whether the generated aerosols satisfy an optimal operational regime, free from overheating, as determined by a linear relation between the mass of vaporized e-liquid vs. supplied power and (2) obtaining the mean yields of aldehydes for each of the tested power settings and coils. The results of these tests show that, under the main conditions used in in vivo testing, the ECX equipment fails to comply with these consistency requirements, especially for coils with low subohm resistance, a shortcoming that can be corrected by applying much larger airflows for these coils. Therefore, the outcomes of preclinical studies using the ECX equipment should be examined with great scepticism and subjected to further testing."

        "abstract": "Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the most common and serious type of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, characterized by chronic, progressive, and low survival rates, while unknown disease etiology. Until recently, patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis have a poor prognosis, high mortality, and limited treatment options, due to the lack of effective early diagnostic and prognostic tools. Therefore, we aimed to identify biomarkers for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis based on multiple machine-learning approaches and to evaluate the role of immune infiltration in the disease. The gene expression profile and its corresponding clinical data of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Next, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with the threshold of FDR < 0.05 and |log2 foldchange (FC)| > 0.585 were analyzed via R package “DESeq2” and GO enrichment and KEGG pathways were run in R software. Then, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression, support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) and random forest (RF) algorithms were combined to screen the key potential biomarkers of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. The diagnostic performance of these biomarkers was evaluated through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Moreover, the CIBERSORT algorithm was employed to assess the infiltration of immune cells and the relationship between the infiltrating immune cells and the biomarkers. Finally, we sought to understand the potential pathogenic role of the biomarker (SLAIN1) in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis using a mouse model and cellular model. A total of 3658 differentially expressed genes of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis were identified, including 2359 upregulated genes and 1299 downregulated genes. FHL2, HPCAL1, RNF182, and SLAIN1 were identified as biomarkers of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis using LASSO logistic regression, RF, and SVM-RFE algorithms. The ROC curves confirmed the predictive accuracy of these biomarkers both in the training set and test set. Immune cell infiltration analysis suggested that patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis had a higher level of B cells memory, Plasma cells, T cells CD8, T cells follicular helper, T cells regulatory (Tregs), Macrophages M0, and Mast cells resting compared with the control group. Correlation analysis demonstrated that FHL2 was significantly associated with the infiltrating immune cells. qPCR and western blotting analysis suggested that SLAIN1 might be a signature for the diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. In this study, we identified four potential biomarkers (FHL2, HPCAL1, RNF182, and SLAIN1) and evaluated the potential pathogenic role of SLAIN1 in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. These findings may have great significance in guiding the understanding of disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis."

        "abstract": "Multispectral optoacoustic tomography is a high-resolution functional imaging modality that can non-invasively access a broad range of pathophysiological phenomena. Real-time imaging would enable translation of multispectral optoacoustic tomography into clinical imaging, visualize dynamic pathophysiological changes associated with disease progression and enable in situ diagnoses. Model-based reconstruction affords state-of-the-art optoacoustic images but cannot be used for real-time imaging. On the other hand, deep learning enables fast reconstruction of optoacoustic images, but the lack of experimental ground-truth training data leads to reduced image quality for in vivo scans. In this work we achieve accurate optoacoustic image reconstruction in 31 ms per image for arbitrary (experimental) input data by expressing model-based reconstruction with a deep neural network. The proposed deep learning framework, DeepMB, generalizes to experimental test data through training on optoacoustic signals synthesized from real-world images and ground truth optoacoustic images generated by model-based reconstruction. Based on qualitative and quantitative evaluation on a diverse dataset of in vivo images, we show that DeepMB reconstructs images approximately 1,000-times faster than the iterative model-based reference method while affording near-identical image qualities. Accurate and real-time image reconstructions with DeepMB can enable full access to the high-resolution and multispectral contrast of handheld optoacoustic tomography, thus adoption into clinical routines."

The cause of male infertility is still poorly diagnosed and treated. One of the prominent causes of male infertility is disturbed spermatogenesis, which can lead to nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA). Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) allows us to identify novel rare variants in potentially NOA-associated genes, among others, in the ESX1 gene. The aim of this study was to activate the ESX1 gene using CRISPRa technology in human germ cells (testicular seminoma cells—TCam-2). Successful activation of the ESX1 gene in TCam-2 cells using the CRISPRa system was achieved, and the expression level of the ESX1 gene was significantly higher in modified TCam-2 cells than in WT cells or the negative control with nontargeted gRNA (p < 0.01). Using RNA-seq, a network of over 50 genes potentially regulated by the ESX1 gene was determined. Finally, 6 genes, NANOG, CXCR4, RPS6KA5, CCND1, PDE1C, and LINC00662, participating in cell proliferation and differentiation were verified in azoospermic patients with and without a mutation in the ESX1 gene as well as in men with normal spermatogenesis, where inverse correlations in the expression levels of the observed genes were noted."

Manual diagnosis requires extensive experience and skill, and identifying surgical indications in assessing the disease severity is more challenging. We aimed to develop a real-time lesion visualization deep-learning pipeline to solve this problem. This multicenter retrospective-prospective study used 14,085 images in 8736 consecutive patients (median age, eight months) with ileocolic intussusception who underwent ultrasound at six hospitals to train, validate, and test the deep-learning pipeline. Subsequently, the algorithm was validated in an internal image test set and an external video dataset. Furthermore, the performances of junior, intermediate, senior, and junior sonographers with AI-assistance were prospectively compared in 242 volunteers using the DeLong test. This tool recognized 1,086 images with three ileocolic intussusception signs with an average of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (average-AUC) of 0.972. It diagnosed 184 patients with no intussusception, nonsurgical intussusception, and surgical intussusception in 184 ultrasound videos with an average-AUC of 0.956. In the prospective pilot study using 242 volunteers, junior sonographers’ performances were significantly improved with AI-assistance (average-AUC: 0.966 vs. 0.857, P < 0.001; median scanning-time: 9.46 min vs. 3.66 min, P < 0.001), which were comparable to those of senior sonographers (average-AUC: 0.966 vs. 0.973, P = 0.600). Thus, here, we report that the deep-learning pipeline that guides lesions in real-time and is interpretable during ultrasound scanning could assist sonographers in improving the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosing intussusception and identifying surgical indications."

We analyzed gene enrichment using 343 HGSOC cases extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas. The corresponding biomedical computed tomography images accessed from The Cancer Imaging Archive were used to construct the radiomic signature (Radscore). A radiomic nomogram was built by combining the Radscore and clinical and genetic information based on multimodal analysis. We compared the model performances and clinical practicability via area under the curve (AUC), Kaplan–Meier survival, and decision curve analyses. LCK mRNA expression was associated with the prognosis of HGSOC patients, serving as a significant prognostic marker of the immune response and immune cells infiltration. Six radiomic characteristics were chosen to predict the expression of LCK and overall survival (OS) in HGSOC patients. The logistic regression (LR) radiomic model exhibited slightly better predictive abilities than the support vector machine model, as assessed by comparing combined results. The performance of the LR radiomic model for predicting the level of LCK expression with five-fold cross-validation achieved AUCs of 0.879 and 0.834, respectively, in the training and validation sets. Decision curve analysis at 60 months demonstrated the high clinical utility of our model within thresholds of 0.25 and 0.7. The radiomic nomograms were robust and displayed effective calibration. Abnormally high expression of LCK in HGSOC patients is significantly correlated with the tumor immune microenvironment and can be used as an essential indicator for predicting the prognosis of HGSOC. The multimodal radiomic machine learning approach can capture the heterogeneity of HGSOC, noninvasively predict the expression of LCK, and replace LCK for predictive analysis, providing a new idea for predicting the clinical prognosis of HGSOC and formulating a personalized treatment plan."

However, accurate and reliable methods for diagnosing pancreatic diseases are critical for improving patient outcomes. To this end, we measured the Müller matrices of ex-vivo unfixed human pancreatic tissue and leverage the feature-learning capabilities of a machine-learning model to derive an optimized data representation that minimizes normal-abnormal classification error. We show experimentally that our approach accurately differentiates between normal and abnormal pancreatic tissue.

In the test cohort, our approach achieves an area under the curve value of 0.966 for overall cancer detection. Detection sensitivity for early-stage patients achieves 73% at 99% specificity. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility to accurately localize the origin of cancer signals with combined methylation and fragmentation profiling of tissue-specific accessible chromatin regions. Overall, this proof-of-concept study provides a technical platform to utilize multimodal cfDNA features for improved cancer detection."

The primary endpoint was defined as favorable neurological survival (cerebral performance category score of 1 or 2 at 1 month). A decision tree model was developed from randomly selected 77,845 patients (development cohort) and validated in 8650 patients (validation cohort). In the development cohort, the presence of prehospital return of spontaneous circulation was the best predictor of favorable neurological survival, followed by the absence of adrenaline administration and age. The patients were categorized into 9 groups with probabilities of favorable neurological survival ranging from 5.7 to 70.8% (areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.851 and 0.844 in the development and validation cohorts, respectively). Our model is potentially helpful in stratifying the probability of favorable neurological survival in patients with witnessed OHCA and an initial shockable rhythm."

These biomarkers are detectable by Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM), an advanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging technique detecting magnetic properties. When analysed with radiomic techniques that exploit its intrinsic quantitative nature, QSM may furnish biomarkers to facilitate early diagnosis of MS and timely assessment of progression. In this work, we explore the robustness of QSM radiomic features by varying the number of grey levels (GLs) and echo times (TEs), in a sample of healthy controls and patients with MS. We analysed the white matter in total and within six clinically relevant tracts, including the cortico-spinal tract and the optic radiation. After optimising the number of GLs (n = 64), at least 65% of features were robust for each Volume of Interest (VOI), with no difference (p > .05) between left and right hemispheres. Different outcomes in feature robustness among the VOIs depend on their characteristics, such as volume and variance of susceptibility values. This study validated the processing pipeline for robustness analysis and established the reliability of QSM-based radiomics features against GLs and TEs. Our results provide important insights for future radiomics studies using QSM in clinical applications."

Moreover, due to inherent limitations in manual annotation, only a sparse set of landmarks are typically labeled. To address these issues, we developed an approach, which we term GlowTrack, for generating orders of magnitude more training data, enabling models that generalize across experimental contexts. We describe: a) a high-throughput approach for producing hidden labels using fluorescent markers; b) a multi-camera, multi-light setup for simulating diverse visual conditions; and c) a technique for labeling many landmarks in parallel, enabling dense tracking.

Although many studies have identified the risk factors and causes of PS, few have precisely predicted the probability of PS formation before surgery. To validate whether an artificial intelligence model can accurately predict PS formation in patients with rectal cancer after sphincter-saving operations. Patients with rectal cancer who underwent a sphincter-saving operation at Taipei Medical University Hospital between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2021, were retrospectively included in this study. A machine learning technique was used to predict whether a PS would form after a sphincter-saving operation. We included 19 routinely available preoperative variables in the artificial intelligence analysis. To evaluate the efficiency of the model, 6 performance metrics were utilized: accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and area under the receiving operating characteristic curve. In our classification pipeline, the data were randomly divided into a training set (80% of the data) and a validation set (20% of the data). The artificial intelligence models were trained using the training dataset, and their performance was evaluated using the validation dataset. Synthetic minority oversampling was used to solve the data imbalance. A total of 428 patients were included, and the PS rate was 13.6% (58/428) in the training set. The logistic regression (LR), Gaussian Naïve Bayes (GNB), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), Gradient Boosting (GB), random forest, decision tree and light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) algorithms were employed. The accuracies of the logistic regression (LR), Gaussian Naïve Bayes (GNB), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), Gradient Boosting (GB), random forest (RF), decision tree (DT) and light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) models were 70%, 76%, 89%, 93%, 95%, 79% and 93%, respectively. The area under the receiving operating characteristic curve values were 0.79 for the LR model, 0.84 for the GNB, 0.95 for the XGB, 0.95 for the GB, 0.99 for the RF model, 0.79 for the DT model and 0.98 for the LightGBM model. The key predictors that were identified were the distance of the lesion from the anal verge, clinical N stage, age, sex, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, and preoperative albumin and carcinoembryonic antigen levels. Integration of artificial intelligence with available preoperative data can potentially predict stoma outcomes after sphincter-saving operations. Our model exhibited excellent predictive ability and can improve the process of obtaining informed consent."

In this retrospective study, we examined Japanese EMS records and neurological outcomes from 2015 to 2020 using nationwide data. We included patients aged ≥ 18 years with cardiogenic OHCA and visualized EMS activity time variations across prefectures. A five-layer neural network generated a neurological outcome predictive model that was trained on 80% of the data and tested on the remaining 20%. We evaluated interventions associated with changes in prognosis by simulating these changes after adjusting for time factors, including EMS contact to hospital arrival and initial defibrillation or drug administration. The study encompassed 460,540 patients, with the model’s area under the curve and accuracy being 0.96 and 0.95, respectively. Reducing transport time and defibrillation improved outcomes universally, while combining transport time and drug administration showed varied efficacy.

        "abstract": "In this work, a novel method for tumor margin identification in electromagnetic imaging is proposed to optimize the tumor removal surgery. This capability will enable the visualization of the border of the cancerous tissue for the surgeon prior or during the excision surgery. To this end, the border between the normal and tumor parts needs to be identified. Therefore, the images need to be segmented into tumor and normal areas. We propose a deep learning technique which divides the electromagnetic images into two regions: tumor and normal, with high accuracy. We formulate deep learning from a perspective relevant to electromagnetic image reconstruction. A recurrent auto-encoder network architecture (termed here DeepTMI) is presented. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated by segmenting the reconstructed images of an experimental tissue-mimicking phantom. The structure similarity measure (SSIM) and mean-square-error (MSE) average of normalized reconstructed results by the DeepTMI method are about 0.94 and 0.04 respectively, while that average obtained from the conventional backpropagation (BP) method can hardly overcome 0.35 and 0.41 respectively."

        "abstract": "The prognosis of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) malignant neoplasms deeply relies on an accurate determination of the histological subtype, which currently involves the light microscopy visual analysis of histological slides, considering notably tumor architecture and cytology. RCC subtyping is therefore a time-consuming and tedious process, sometimes requiring expert review, with great impact on diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of RCC neoplasms. In this study, we investigate the automatic RCC subtyping classification of 91 patients, diagnosed with clear cell RCC, papillary RCC, chromophobe RCC, or renal oncocytoma, through deep learning based methodologies. We show how the classification performance of several state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are perfectible among the different RCC subtypes. Thus, we introduce a new classification model leveraging a combination of supervised deep learning models (specifically CNNs) and pathologist’s expertise, giving birth to a hybrid approach that we termed ExpertDeepTree (ExpertDT). Our findings prove ExpertDT’s superior capability in the RCC subtyping task, with respect to traditional CNNs, and suggest that introducing some expert-based knowledge into deep learning models may be a valuable solution for complex classification cases."

        "abstract": "We aimed to derive the Febrile Infants Risk Score at Triage (FIRST) to quantify risk for serious bacterial infections (SBIs), defined as bacteremia, meningitis and urinary tract infections. We performed a prospective observational study on febrile infants < 3 months old at a tertiary hospital in Singapore between 2018 and 2021. We utilized machine learning and logistic regression to derive 2 models: FIRST, based on patient demographics, vital signs and history, and FIRST + , adding laboratory results to the same variables. SBIs were diagnosed in 224/1002 (22.4%) infants. Among 994 children with complete data, age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.01 95%CI 1.01–1.02, p < 0.001), high temperature (aOR 2.22 95%CI 1.69–2.91, p < 0.001), male sex (aOR 2.62 95%CI 1.86–3.70, p < 0.001) and fever of ≥ 2 days (aOR 1.79 95%CI 1.18–2.74, p = 0.007) were independently associated with SBIs. For FIRST + , abnormal urine leukocyte esterase (aOR 16.46 95%CI 10.00–27.11, p < 0.001) and procalcitonin (aOR 1.05 95%CI 1.01–1.09, p = 0.009) were further identified. A FIRST + threshold of ≥ 15% predicted risk had a sensitivity of 81.8% (95%CI 70.5–91.0%) and specificity of 65.6% (95%CI 57.8–72.7%). In the testing dataset, FIRST + had an area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.87 (95%CI 0.81–0.94). These scores can potentially guide triage and prioritization of febrile infants."

        "abstract": "Medical research frequently relies on Cox regression to analyze the survival distribution of cancer patients. Nonetheless, in specific scenarios, neural networks hold the potential to serve as a robust alternative. In this study, we aim to scrutinize the effectiveness of Cox regression and neural network models in assessing the survival outcomes of patients who have undergone treatment for colorectal cancer. We conducted a retrospective study on 284 colorectal cancer patients who underwent surgery at Imam Khomeini clinic in Hamadan between 2001 and 2017. The data was used to train both Cox regression and neural network models, and their predictive accuracy was compared using diagnostic measures such as sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, accuracy, negative predictive value, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The analyses were performed using STATA 17 and R4.0.4 software. The study revealed that the best neural network model had a sensitivity of 74.5% (95% CI 61.0–85.0), specificity of 83.3% (65.3–94.4), positive predictive value of 89.1% (76.4–96.4), negative predictive value of 64.1% (47.2–78.8), AUC of 0.79 (0.70–0.88), and accuracy of 0.776 for death prediction. For recurrence, the best neural network model had a sensitivity of 88.1% (74.4–96.0%), specificity of 83.7% (69.3–93.2%), positive predictive value of 84.1% (69.9–93.4%), negative predictive value of 87.8% (73.8–95.9%), AUC of 0.86 (0.78–0.93), and accuracy of 0.859. The Cox model had comparable results, with a sensitivity of 73.6% (64.8–81.2) and 85.5% (78.3–91.0), specificity of 89.6% (83.8–93.8) and 98.0% (94.4–99.6), positive predictive value of 84.0% (75.6–90.4) and 97.4% (92.6–99.5), negative predictive value of 82.0% (75.6–90.4) and 88.8% (0.83–93.1), AUC of 0.82 (0.77–0.86) and 0.92 (0.89–0.95), and accuracy of 0.88 and 0.92 for death and recurrence prediction, respectively. In conclusion, the study found that both Cox regression and neural network models are effective in predicting early recurrence and death in patients with colorectal cancer after curative surgery. The neural network model showed slightly better sensitivity and negative predictive value for death, while the Cox model had better specificity and positive predictive value for recurrence. Overall, both models demonstrated high accuracy and AUC, indicating their usefulness in predicting these outcomes."

        "abstract": "Both blood glucose and lactate are well-known predictors of organ dysfunction and mortality in critically ill patients. Previous research has shown that concurrent adjustment for glucose and lactate modifies the relationship between these variables and patient outcomes, including blunting of the association between blood glucose and patient outcome. We aim to investigate the relationship between ICU admission blood glucose and hospital mortality while accounting for lactate and diabetic status. Across 43,250 ICU admissions, weighted to account for missing data, we assessed the predictive ability of several logistic regression and generalised additive models that included blood glucose, blood lactate and diabetic status. We found that inclusion of blood glucose marginally improved predictive performance in all patients: AUC-ROC 0.665 versus 0.659 (p = 0.005), with a greater degree of improvement seen in non-diabetics: AUC-ROC 0.675 versus 0.663 (p < 0.001). Inspection of the estimated risk profiles revealed the standard U-shaped risk profile for blood glucose was only present in non-diabetic patients after controlling for blood lactate levels. Future research should aim to utilise observational data to estimate whether interventions such as insulin further modify this effect, with the goal of informing future RCTs of interventions targeting glycaemic control in the ICU."

        "abstract": "Asherman’s Syndrome is characterized by intrauterine adhesions or scarring, which cause infertility, menstrual abnormalities, and recurrent pregnancy loss. The pathophysiology of this syndrome remains unknown, with treatment restricted to recurrent surgical removal of intrauterine scarring, which has limited success. Here, we decode the Asherman’s Syndrome endometrial cell niche by analyzing data from over 200,000 cells with single-cell RNA-sequencing in patients with this condition and through in vitro analyses of Asherman’s Syndrome patient-derived endometrial organoids. Our endometrial atlas highlights the loss of the endometrial epithelium, alterations to epithelial differentiation signaling pathways such as Wnt and Notch, and the appearance of characteristic epithelium expressing secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor during the window of implantation. We describe syndrome-associated alterations in cell-to-cell communication and gene expression profiles that support a dysfunctional pro-fibrotic, pro-inflammatory, and anti-angiogenic environment."

        "abstract": "Unsupervised clustering of intensive care unit (ICU) medications may identify unique medication clusters (i.e., pharmacophenotypes) in critically ill adults. We performed an unsupervised analysis with Restricted Boltzmann Machine of 991 medications profiles of patients managed in the ICU to explore pharmacophenotypes that correlated with ICU complications (e.g., mechanical ventilation) and patient-centered outcomes (e.g., length of stay, mortality). Six unique pharmacophenotypes were observed, with unique medication profiles and clinically relevant differences in ICU complications and patient-centered outcomes. While pharmacophenotypes 2 and 4 had no statistically significant difference in ICU length of stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, or duration of vasopressor use, their mortality differed significantly (9.0% vs. 21.9%, p < 0.0001). Pharmacophenotype 4 had a mortality rate of 21.9%, compared with the rest of the pharmacophenotypes ranging from 2.5 to 9%. Phenotyping approaches have shown promise in classifying the heterogenous syndromes of critical illness to predict treatment response and guide clinical decision support systems but have never included comprehensive medication information. This first-ever machine learning approach revealed differences among empirically-derived subgroups of ICU patients that are not typically revealed by traditional classifiers. Identification of pharmacophenotypes may enable enhanced decision making to optimize treatment decisions."
